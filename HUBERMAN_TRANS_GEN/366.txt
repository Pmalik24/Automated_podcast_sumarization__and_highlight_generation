TO MAKE SURE TO THANK THE SPONSORS AT THAT EVENT WHICH WERE E G ONE AND EIGHT SLEEP EIGHT SLEEP MAKE SMART MATTRESS COVERS WITH COOLING HEATING AND SLEEP TRACKING CAPACITY ONE OF THE KEY THINGS TO GETTING A GREAT NIGHTS SLEEP IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT IS CORRECT AND THAT'S BECAUSE IN ORDER TO FALL IN STAY DEEPLY ASLEEP YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE ACTUALLY HAS TO DROP BY ABOUT ONE TO THREE DEGREES AND IN ORDER TO WAKE UP FEELING REFRESHED AND ENERGIZED YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE ACTUALLY HAS TO INCREASE BY ABOUT ONE TO THREE DEGREES WITH EIGHT SLEEP YOU CAN PROGRAM THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT IN THE BEGINNING MIDDLE AND END OF YOUR NIGHT IT HAS A NUMBER OF OTHER FEATURES LIKE TRACKING THE AMOUNT OF RAPID I MOVEINT AN SLOW WAVE SLEEP THAT YOU GET THINGS ARE ESSENTIAL TO REALLY DILING IN THE PERFECT NIGHT SLEEP FOR YOU I'VE BEN SLEEPING ON AN EIGHTSLEEP MATTRESS COVER FOR WELL OVER TWO YEARS NOW AND IT HAS GREATLY IMPROVED MY SLEEP BY FALL ASLEEP FAR MORE QUICKLY I WAKE UP FAR LESS OFTEN IN THEMIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND I WAKE UP FEELING FAR MORE REFRESHED THAN I EVER DID PRIOR TO USING IN EIGHT SLEEP MATTRESS COVER IF YOU LIKE TO TRY

CLAIM THAT SPECIAL OFFER AND NOW WITHOUT FURTHER ADO THE QUESTION IN ANSWER SESSION FROM OUR LIVE EVENT AT THE MERIDIAN THEATERE IN TORONTO ONTARIO  O K I'M WHAT MOTIVE ATED ME TO DO THE GEST SERIES WITH PAUL CONTIOCESEO FIRST OF ALL FOR THOSE AAS THAT DON'T KNOW PAUL CONTIES A PCYCHIATRIC IS A STAMFORD AND HARVARD TRAINED PCYCHIATRIS UM AND I WANTED TO DO THE SERIES WITH PAUL FOR SEVERAL REASONS UM AND WE INITIATED THAT SERIES A FIRST OF ALL IM HE'S INCREDIBLY TALENTED AS A CLINITION AND YET I'M DESPITE HAVING WRITTEN AN EXCELLENT BOOK ABOUT TRAMA I FELT THAT TWO THINGS WERE TRUE FOR SURE ONE IS THAT MOST PEOPLE WON'T GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH PAUL SADLY IS TEASTIME LIMITED AND SECOND THAT UM HIS EXPERTESE IS INCREDIBLY VAST NOT JUST RESTRICTED TO TRAMA TRAMAS IF UNDERSTOOD CAN BE TRANSMUTED INTO YOU KNOW DE SOURCES OF KNOWLEDGE THAT OTHER PEOPLE CAN BENEFIT FROM IT INDEED I'M WHAT I FOUND IN PAUL AS I' GOT TO KNOW HIM IS THAT HE HAS JUST PROFOUND INSIGHT INTO THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND AND PEOPLE HAD LONG ASKED ME  YOU ROUNT IN AND AROUND THE POKCATS WHAT ABOUT THE SUBCONSCIOUS WHAT ABOUT THE UNCONSCIOUS AND I WAS OF THE MIND THAT THE SUPERCOMPUTER OF THE HUMAN BRAIN IS THE FOREBRAIN THE THINKING PLANNING CONTACT SETTING PECE RIPE EVINER FOREHEAD STHER YOT'S THE REASON THAT WE'RE NOT THE HOUSE CATS THE HOUSE CATS OF THE HOUSE CATS AND THATS REASON WERE THE CURATORS OF THE PLANET BUT PAUL SAID ON NNN NON THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND IS THE SUPERCOMPUTER OF THE MIND LIKE LE THAT SOUNDS GREAT BUT HOW DO WE UNDERSTAND THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND AND HE HAS A REALLY BIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL AN PSYCHIATRIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNCONSCIOUS AND IN THAT SERIES HE TALKS ABOUT THESE SO CALLED CUPBOARDS THAT WE CAN LOOK INTO IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND OUR UNCONSCIOUS UNCONSCIOUS MIND IN ORDER TO ALLOWR UNCONSCIOUS MIND TO TEACH US THINGS ABOUT OURSELVES THAT ARE USEFUL AND THEIR THREE MAIN PLACES WHERE OUR UNCONSCIOUS TEACHES US USEFUL THINGS THAT ALLOW US TO BE MORE CONSCIOUS OF THE WAY THAT OUR BRAIN IS WORKING IN USEFUL WAYS A THE FIRST IS IN THESE LIMITAL STATES BETWEEN WAKING AND SLEEP IT REALLY DOES SEEM TO BE THE CASE THAT WHEN SURPRISE SURPRISE WE'RE COMPLETELY STILL AND WE'RE EMERGING FROM OR WE'RE DROPPING INTO STATES OF REDUCED AUTONOMIC AROUSAL BUT OUR LEVEL OF THOUGHT IF YOU WILL IS STILL ACTIVE ENOUGH THAT WE ARE AWARE MAYBE VEN LUCID DREAMS AND ALSO IN DREAMS OUR UNCONSCIOUS MIND USES AS I THINK YOUNG INFROID PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD SYMBOLS TO TEACH US THINGS BUT EVERYTHING'S FLIPED AND THERE GENDERS FLIP LIKE LIKE THE PRT LIKE JUST CAUSE HE ROURE HAVING A CONFLICT WITH SOMEBODY IN YOUR LIFE WHOS A A MAN DOESN'T MEAN THAT THAT PERSON SHOWS UP AS A MAN THAT COULD SHOPE AS AN ANIMALS A SPECIES ARE FLIPPED THE SYMBOLS BECOME MISSHMASHED BUT PAUL MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT ALL THIS CAN BE PARSED IF YOU DO A CERTAIN KIND OF INTROSPECTIVE WORK AND I THOUGHT THAT WOULD MEAN A LOT OF TALK THERABY THAT PEOPLE WOULD OR HOW WE CAN GET PEOPLE TO LEARN HOW TO D TALK THERE BE BY THEMSELVES WE WANT TO KEEP THINGS AS MUCH YOU KNOW INDEPENDENT OF COST AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND THE PRACTICES HE STARTED TALKING ABOUT OR INCREDIBLY SIMPL THINGS LIKE MIRROR WORK THE SOME OF THE PSYCHOLOGIUS IN THE ROOM WILL BE FAMILIAR WITH THIS I THOUGHT MIRROR WORK WHAT IS THAT HE SAID LITERALLY PEOPLE TRYING TO ACTOF IT THERE UNCONSCIOUS IT NOTORE EXCUSE ME ACSESS THEY'RE UNCONSCIOU IN SLEEP BY A PRACTICE OF STARING INTO THE MIRROR FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME WHILE AWAKE IN REFLECTING ON SELF AND ASPIRATIONS IN THE IDEA OF THE BODY IS A CONTAINER ALL THE SOT STUFF EVEN FOR A KID FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIAS OND REALLY WIL NEW AG BUT HERE IT'S SCRIPTED BY PAUL INTO A FORMAL STRUCTURE THAT ONE CAN USE TO PARSE YOUR OWN MENTAL HEALTH AND ENHANCE MENTAL HEALTH SO THAT WAS THE REASON FOR FOR DOING THE SERIES AND ESPECIALLY THE THE EPISODE ON RELATIONSHIPS NOT JUST ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS I FOUND HASN'T COME OUT YET INCREDIBLY INTERESTING BECAUSE HE TALKED ABOUT HOW IN HIS CLINICAL EXPERIENCE AUL VIRTUALLY ALL THE STUFF THAT PEOPLE PAY ATTENTION TO IN RELATIONAL STUFF IS ARE THEY ENORSISIS ARE THEY AOBSESSIVE IS THIS PERSON A MUSICIAN VERSES WHETHER OR NOT I'M AN ACCOUNT ANT WOULD ARE WE COMPATIBLE THAT NONE OF THAT STUFF PREDICTS ANYTHING AS WELL AS THE BALANCE OF THESE THREE DRIVES THE AGGRESSIVE DRIVE THE PLEASURE DRIVE IN THE SO CALLED GENERATIVE DRIVE AND I FOUND IT TO BE FASCINATING AND I'M EXCITED FOR THAT EPISODE THE OTHER EPISODES COME OUT BUT BASILYCAUSE PAUL'S BRILLIANT AND HE MAKES THE O WHAT I CONSIDER PRETTY OBSCURE AND A OPAQUE VERY CLEAR IND CONCRETE IN THEIR BUNCH OF WORK SHEETS AGAIN ALL AVAILABLE AS ZOURO COST AND NONE OF THEM REQUIRING THAT YOU DO THERAPY WITH ANYBODY IF IF YOU CHOOSE NOT TO THIS IS ALL THE KIND OF WORK ONE COULD DO ON ONE'S SELF AND THE LASTING I'LL SAY ABOUT THIS IS THAT D I SHOULD HAVE SAID THIS FIRST IS AT THE PRIMARY MOTIVATION WAS WE DID A SERIES OF DOCTOR ANY GALLOPING ON PHYSICAL FITNESS WHY ISN'T THERE A SERIES ON MENTAL FITNESS I LIKE WHAT IS THAT WHY DO WE TALK SO MUCH ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH WHEN WE'RE AND IT'S USUALLY A CONVERSATION ABOUT MENTAL ILLNESS WHAT PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE TOOLS AND PRACTICES THAT ARE ZERO COST I BELIEVE TO BE ABLE TO INTERESTPACT IN A STRUCTURED WAY AND ENHANCE THEIR MENTAL HEALTH THE INDEPENDENT OF YOU KNOW THEIR LEVEL OF INCOMEIN I THINK PAUL WAS THE GOD TO DO IT AND WILL DO MORE OF THAT WITH OTHER PEOPLE AS WELL BECAUSE NO SINGLE EPISODE ABOUT ANY TOPIC OR SERIES CAN EXHAUSTIBLY COVER AT ANY TOPIC OF A LORD NOLES WE WE WILL TRY O K NEXT QUESTIOND WHAT ARE THE RECOMMENDID PROTO CALLS IN BEST PRACTICES TO ENHANSOME MOTIONAL RESEALING TOME DEVELOP EFFECTIVE RESPONSEI DURING HIGHLY TRIGURING SITUATION YOUR ASK IN THE WRONG GUY UM YE UM I MEAN I DON'T SNAP I DON'T SNAP I WAS A WILD TEA NEADOUR BUT I DON'T SNAP I'M NOT THE AGGRESSOR BUT I DO HAVE A SNAP BUTN AND IT'S BEEN PUSHED UT BEFORE AND AVE TO SAY WHEN THAT HAPPENS IT'S REALLY KIND OF A SCARY THING NOT TO ME RIGHT UM IT HAS BEEN MANY YEARS BUT I THINK ANY ONE WHO'S WHO'S HID THAT THRESHOLD WHERE YOU JUST YOU TRY NOT TO SAY SOMETHING YOU SAY IT ANYWAY YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S USUALLY HOWHOW IT SHOWS UP FOR PEOPLE UM I THINK WE HEAR THE STATEMENTS LIKE BE RESPONSIVE NOT REACTIVE ID THAT'S WHY I BECAME A BIOLOGIST CAS STELF LIKE THAT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME  IN THAT MOMENT HOW ARE YOU RESPONSIVE NOT REACTIVE SO TO ME OLY WHAT ARE THE TOOLS CLEARLY AS YOU GO UP THAT CONTINUUM OF AUTONOMIC AROUSAL IT BECOMES MUCH HARDER TO DO WHATEVER THAT MEANS RIGHT SO THAT HENCE THE THE TOOLS FOR REDUCING STRESTS IN REAL TIME I I THINK THE ONE THAT WE HAVEN'T EMPHASIZED SO MUCH ON THE PODCAST UM AND BY THE WAY THANKS TO SOME GREAT THEROPYAN THAT WAS NOT VOLUNTARY I ID WAS A ABLE TO YOU KNOW I WAS A WILD KID A WILD WILD KID I HUNG OUN WILD KIDS AND IM THINGS WERE PRETTY DIFFERENT THEN AND WE WE WORKED IT OUT NO BUT I THINK NOWADAYS IT'S WONDERFUL BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE ARE MORE CONSCIOUS OF UM THE NEED STO UNDERSTAND THEIR NERVOUS SYSTEM THEIR OWN PSYCHOLOGY THAT WASN'T AS CALMON BACK THEN UM IN FACT I HID THE FACT THAT I HAD TO DEFERABY FOR A LONG TIME THINKING LILD LIKE YOT WENS GETTHING IM CRAZY THEY DID CALL ME CRAZY YOUN I THINK THINKS AFE REALLY CHANGED I THINK THE LAST TWENTY YEARS HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT A PROFOUND SHIFT IN THE WAY THAT WE THINK ABOUT OUR OWN SPECIES AND WHAT WHAT AR E USEFUL TOOLS AND PRACTICES AND I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR IS THAT THAT THRESHOLD FOR A STRESS RESPONSE REALLY IS DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE DIFFERENT INDIFFERENT SITUATIONS BUT THAT IT IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE A'M PRACTICED AND ELEVATED AND UM IN TERMS OF NOT GETTING NEAR THAT TRIGGER POINT OUT THROUGH THE TYPES OF PRACTICES I TALKED ABOUT EARLYORE GETTING MORE COMFORTABLE WITH A DRENALIN CIRCULATING YOUR SYSTEM IS WHAT IT'S REALLY ABOUT FRANKLY BUT IT OF COURSE AT ALL STARTS WITH A OOD NIGHTS SLEEP OR EDIS CN TO MAKE YOU FAR LESS REACTIVE BUT OF COURSE WHEN YOU'RE STRAST THAT'S OFTEN WHEN YOU'RE NOT GETTING GOOD SLEEP SO I THINK THAT ULTIMATELY THAT OUR ABILITY TO AS YOU KNOW MORE EMOTIONAL RESILIENCE AND EFFECTIVE RESPONSES DURING TRIGGERING SITUATIONS IS REALLY THE CONSEQUENCE OF PRACTICES OF TAKING GOOD CARE OUTSIDE OF THOSE SITUATIONS AND THEN OF COURSE INEVITABLY THERE WILL BE SITUATIONS WHERE PEOPLE GET TRIGGERD AND IT'S ACTUALLY INTERESTING TO SEE THE WAY THAT PEOPLE BEHAVE ON LINE AND THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW MANY PEOPLE IN FACT IND SCIENCE AS WELL HAVE LITERALLY LOST THEIR JOBS FOR HAVING YOU KNOW NOT BEN ABLE TO CONTROL THEIR THUMS IT'S HAVE WE'RE IN AN ODD TIME WHERE THERE'S THAT THE THE DISTANCING OF DOING THINGS ON LINE I SUPPOSED TO IMPERSON WHERE PEOPLE SOMEHOW ENGAGING SAYING THINGS AND DOING THINGS THAT THEY WOULDN'T IN PERSON BUT I THINK THAT ULTIMATELY IT'S THE CONSEQUENCE OF GOODS SELF CARE AND THIS GETS ACTUALLY BACK TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE COVERED IN THE CONTY SERIES YOU KNOW WE HEARE ABOUT SELF CARE AS WE THINK THAT MEANS MISSAGES WHICH ARE GREAT BY THE WAY AND WE THINK THAT IS ABOUT EXERCISE AND THAT'S WONDERFUL BUT MUCH OF SELF CARE IS ABOUT REALLY MAKING SURE THAT OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IS IN THE STATE THAT WE NEED TO BE IN IN ORDER TO GO ABOUT OUR DAY AND I THINK THIS IS WHY MORNING ROUTINES AND PRACTICES ARE SO VITAL I THINK AT THOSE SET THE STAGE FOR THE EMOTIONAL RASILIENTS THES SET THE STAGE FOR AVOIDING GETTING TRIGGER SO TO SPEAK I DON'T THINK THERE'S A LOT THAT ONE CAN DO IN REAL TIME EXCEPT PERHAPS PHYSIOLOGICAL SIZE SO SORRY TO GIVE YOU A SORT OF EMPTY ANSWER I'M NOT A PESSIMIST ON THIS FRUMBUT IT'S I THINK THAT ULTIMATELY IT'S LIKE SAYING WHAT WOULD IF YOU HAVE TO SCALE THE SIDE OF A BUILDING TO GET IN YOU LOCKED YOURSELF OUT AND WHATKANG YOU TO PREPARE FOR THAT WE CAN BUY A LADDER BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A LADDER YOU KNOW WHAT CUL WHAT YOU PROBABLY SHOULD DO IS BE PHYSICALLY FIT ENOUGH TO YOU NO CLIMB UP A RAILING OR SOMETHING LIKE THATN KNOW HOW TO PICK A LOCK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO UM I THINK ULTIMATELY THAT IT'S THE CONSEQUENCE OF STUFF THAT'S DONE AWAY FROM THOSE TRIGGERING SITUATIONS THAT QUESTION PLEAS HOWOULD YOU DSCRIBE THE BRAIN ACTIVITY OF SOMEBODY WHEN THERE'S SUDDENLY INSPIRED AND HADN' FOSTER INSPIRATION YOU LIFE WELL I TALK TO LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS BUT I I WILL SAY THAT THAT THE BEST WAY TO FOSTER INSPIRATION IS IN THE WORDS OF THE GREAT JOVE STRUMMER THEY ACTUALLY CALL IT STRUMMERS LAW NO JOKE UM NO IN PUT NO OUTPUT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE OBSERVED OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS THAT AS MUCH AS WE NEED TO DEDICATE OURSELVES TO OUR CRAFT TO OUR FAMILYIS TO OUR FRIENDS THAT ULTIMATELY OUR BEST IDEAS COME FROM DESPERATE EXPERIENCES WHEN WE'RE NOT SEEKING A PARTICULAR KIND OF IM PUT TO GET IDEAS NOW MAYBE THIS PRACTICE OF BEING COMPLETELY STILL WHILE BEING ALERT FOSTER'S A LOT OF I I THINK THE WAY I UNDERSTAND IS MORE OF A GUYSERING UP OF A STORED INFORMATION IN THE UNCONSCIOUS SO I THINK RICK WOULD TALK ABOUT IT OR PAUL CON TO WOULD TALK ABOUT IS GUYSERING UP FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS BECAUSE WHEN WE ARE FOCASED ON THE OUTSIDE WORLD WERE TAKING INCENSORY INFORMATION EXTEROCEPTION AS POST O INTERROCEPTION AND OF COURSE THAT EXTERNAL HIMFROM CENSORINFRO MATION THAT KNOWING PUT NO OUTPUT IS THAT THOSE OF THE RAW MATERIALS THAT OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM USES TO CONSTRUCT IDEAS ABOUT ANYTHING SO MY BELIEF AND THIS IS A PRACTICE I DO EVERY WEEK AS I MAKE SURE THAT AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK I EITHER WALK OR HEIKE OR RUN WITHOUT ANY HERPHONES AND I'M TRYING TO GET INTO STATES OF WORTHLESSNESS STATES WHERE I'M NOT DIGESTING APODCAST WHE I'M NOT READING A BOOK WHRE I'M NOT LISTENING TO A LECTURE WERE I'M NOT IN CONVERSATION AND ESSENTIALLY TRYING TO TURN OFF THE THE LINGUISTIC NARRATIVE I WE ARE A STORY TELLING SPECIES WE TEND TO TAKE ALL ALL OUR INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EXPERIENCE AND CONSTRUCT THINGS AROUND LANGUAGE BUT LANGUAGES NOT SPOKEN LANGUAGE IS NOT THE LANGUAGE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THE LANGUAGE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM STILL REMAINS TO BE IDENTIFIED IT'S SOMETHING ELSE FOR PEOPLE THAT THINK AND FEELS IT WILL CERTAINLY CORPORATE THAT SPOKEN LANGUAGE OF COURSE IS IMPORTANT AND WE HAVE SOME COARSE STRUCTURES TO SPOKEN LANGUAGE RECOVER THIS PODCAST EPISODE WITH MY FRIEND AT EACHANG BUT ULTIMATELY THE THE WAY TO COME UP WITH NEW IDEAS INSPIRATION IS GOING TO BE TO COLLECT THE RAW MATERIALS OF EXPERIENCE AND THEN GIVE OURSELVES THESE PERIODS MAY BE VEN JUST FIVE TEN MINUTES YOUT TO LAY AROUND HALF THE DAY DOING NOTHING STILL WHA AWAKE AND GIVE THAT THOSE RAW MATERIALS THE OPPORTUNITY TO TO MARINATE AND COMBINE IN WHATEVER WAYS THAT ARE UNIQUE TO YOU AND THEN TO GUISE OR UP IM WHAT INSPIRATION LOOKS LIKE IN THE BRAIN WE DON'T REALLY KNOW I'M THERE'S AWE THERE SOME STUDIES ABOUT AWE BUT THAT'S DIFFERENT I THE THE WORD THAT BETTER COMES TO MIND IS DELIGHT AWE TENT IN MY MIND IS SOMETHING THAT WE WE WITNESS THAT FROM OVERWHELMS OUR ATTENTION LIKE WHA DELIGHT IS WHEN IT SOMEHOW LINKS UP WITH OUR OWN INTERNAL NARRATIVE LIKE I HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING I'M NOT JUST HERE TO WIT N IS IT YOU'RL FIREWORK SHOW REALLY IMPRESSIVE FIRE WERE SHOW US LIKE ALL BUT THERE'S NOTHING TO DO ABOUT IT IT DOESN'T RELATE TO ANYTHING ABOUT YOU REALLY YOU'RE PURELY A SPECTATOR WE'RE AS DELIGHT AS WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING AND IT'S SOMEHOW LINKS TO SOMETHING IN YOUR EMOTIONAL R PERSONAL HISTORY OR HOW YOU'RE WIRE THAT NOW THERE'S SOMETHING TO DO ABOUT IT THAT'S INSPIRATION AND WE DON'T UNDERSTAND A WHERE THAT EXISTS IN THE BRAIN OR WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE BUT I THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT FEELING WHEN IT HAPPENS AND IT'S  O SO WONDERFUL O KE NEXT QUESTION PLEASE HOW CAN CANADIANS FIGHT THE SEASONABL DEPRESSION WINTERS ER TOO LONG ERE O KEH WELL WILL THIS GIVES ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH YOU WHAT I THINK IS ONE OF THE COOLEST THINGS ABOUT OUR SPECIES UM KNOWS I SAY THAT ABOUT MANY THINGS EM SO WE'VE TALKED ABOUT CIRCATIANG RHYTHMS RIGHT SUNRISES SUNSETS AND WE GET THAT INFORMATION TRANSMITTED INTO OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM BY LOOKING AT THE SUNRISE BY THE AY YOU DON'T HAVE TO WATCH THE SUN CROSS THE HORIZON IT SEEMS TO BE LOW SOLAR ANGLE LOW IN THE SKY ONCE IT'S OVERHEAD IT'S A DIFFERENT SIGNAL 'S A LOW SOLAR ANGLE THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY ABOUT SEEING THE SUN CROSS THE HORIZON BY THE WAY SOME ONE M THE OTHER DAY ON MY TEAM SAID WEI WON'T YOU GET CATARACTS IF YOU LOOK AT THE SON LOW SOLAR ANGLE SUNLIGHT IT'S VERY UNLIKELY TO CAUSE CATARACT'S FO SHU BEU TO STRIN ATTEND TO THIRTY MINUTES THAT SOLAR YOU'R THE SUN OVERHEAD IS WHEN IT'S QUITE BRIGHT YES INDEED SOME PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE AT RIST FOR CATARACTS O UM OPTHEMOLJUST IN THE AUDIENCE CAN ATTACK ME FOR THAT ONE BUT IT WAS OUR CHAIR ABOTHEMOLOGY IT'STANDFOR THAT' SAT IT S OMMON A TRUSTOM O KE THAT'S CIRCATIAN TWENTY FOR HOUR RHYTHMS BUT THERE'S ALSO THE CIRCANUAL RHYTHMS SO IF YOU'RE AT A FAIRLY NORTHERN LOCATION ON THE PLANET NIGHT SKETVERY LONG DAYS GET SHORT IN WINTER WHAT HAPPENS THEN WELL MELATONAN THE HORMON OF DARKNESS RIGHT IS ESSENTIALLY OBLITERATED BY LIGHT BY SUNLIGHT SO WHAT'S HAPPENING WHEN DAYS ARE YOU TWELVE HOURS LONG YOU HAV VERY LITTLE MELATONE IN THE DURATION OF THE MELATONE AN SIGNAL IS VERY SHORT THEN AS YOU PROCEED INTO THE FALL DAYS ARE GETTING SHORTER NIGHTS ARE GETTING LONGER THE DURATION OF THE MELATONEAN SIGNAL IS GETTING LONGER AND LONGER THEN IS COURSE IN WINTER IS LOT MORE DARKNESS MELET TON AN SIGNALS ARE VERY LONG DAYLIGHT SIGNALS ARE VERY SHORT BECAUSE THE DAYS ARE SHORT SO BEUCAUSE IT OQE WELL THAT'S OBVIOUS THANK GOODNESS BUT WHAT THAT MEANS IS INCREDIBLE WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT YOU HAVE A HORMON MELATONEAN THAT SECRETED FROM YOUR PINEAL GLAND WHICH DE CART CALLED THE SEAT OF THE SOUL CAUSE IS ONLY ONE OF THEM IN THE BRAIN O NOWMY CAME UP AT THAT ONE BUT THE PINEL SECRETE SMELATONEAN AND IT AND YOU SUPPRESS MELATONE AN SECRETION WITH SUNLIGHT VIEWING THERE'S A COUPLE OF SINNAPSIS ON BETWEEN THE EYE AND THE PINELBUDY GETS THERE UP THROUGH THE NACK BASELY SERBICAL GANGLY WHAT'S WILD THEREFORE IS THAT THE LOCATION OF THE EARTH AROUND THE SUN AND THE TILT OF THE EARTH IS TRANSLATED INTO A NURL AND THEN A HORMONAL SIGNAL IN YOUR BRAIN WHICH TO ME IS AMAZING THAT LITERALLY MEANS THA THAT THE POSITION OF THE EARTH AROUND THE SUN AND IT'S TILT ARE TRANSLATED INTO A PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGNAL THAT'S WORKING UNCONSCIOUSLY TO TELL YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WHAT TIME OF YEAR IT IS BUT IT DOESN'T CARE WHAT TIME A YEAR IT IS IT CARES ABOUT WHERE YOU ARE IN THIS ORBIT ABOUT THE SUN SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHEN DAYS ARE SAY EIGHT HOURS LONG IN THE FALL VERSES EIGHT HOURS LONG IN THE SPRING WHAT'S DIFFERENT WHAT'S DIFFERENT IS HOW LONG THE SIGNAL WAS THE DAY BEFO OR SO THE SEASONABLE DEPRESSION WE NOW KNOW IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE MELOTONE AND SIGNAL GETTING LONGER NOT AN ABSOLUTE DURATION OF THE MELATONE AND SIGNAL IN OTHER WORDS IN THE SPRING WHEN A DAY IS EIGHT HOURS LONG BUT YESTERDAY THE DAY WAS SEVEN HOURS AND FORTY MINUTES LONG YOUR BRAIN HAS A MEMORY OF HOW MUCH MELOTONE AND WAS RELEASED THE DAY BEFORE MUCH MORE THEN THAT PARTICULAR DAY SO IT'S A SLOW INTEGRATING CLOCK SO THIS IS VERY ROUNDABOUT WAY FOR ME TO TEACH YOU ABOUT THE MELATONE AND SEASONARYM CYCLE AND ANSWER THE QUESTION DIRECTLY BY SAYING IF YOU WANT TO OFFSET SEASONAL DEPRESSION WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS EXTENDING AMOUNT OF BRIGHT LIGHT THAT YOU'RE GETTING IN THE MORNING SLIGHTLY AS DAYS GET SHORTER BUT IT'S THE EXTENSION OF THE BRIGHT LIGHT EXPOSURE AND IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT WITH SUNLIGHT GIERS NO SUNLIGHT CAUSE YOU LIVE IN TORONO NOT TO RONTEAU WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS FIND SOME ARTIFICIAL SOURCE THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT IN THE MORNING BEFORE YOU LEAVE YOUR HOME AND I HAVEN'T TALKED MUCH ABOUT THIS ON THE POKCASK BECAUSE OUR LISTENERS ARE EXTENDED AROUND THE GLOBE AND NOT JUST IN UM NORTHERN LOCATIONS BUT WHAT THIS ESSENTIALY MEANS IS GETTING MAYBE TWO TO THREE MINUTES OF BRIGHT LIGHT EXPOSURE AS YOU'R HEADING FROM FALL INTIL WINTER BRIGHTLIGHT FROM AN ARTIFICIAL SOURCE YOU DO NOT NEED TO PURCHASE A SO CALLED SAD LAMP ONE OF THESE VERY EXPENSIVE SEASONABLE EFFECT DEPRESSION A LAMPS YOU CAN WHAT I DID WAS I PURCHASED CAUSE I'M VERY SENSITIVE TO SEASONABL CHANGES IND LIGHT EVEN THOUGH I DON'T LIVE VERY FAR NORTH AS YOU CAN GET A NINE HUNDRED LUCKS A DRAWING TABLET THESE ARE QUITE INEXPENSIVE THEY'RE NOT ZERO COSPIC QUITE INEXPENSIVE AND JUST PUT THAT ON YOUR DESK OR ON YOUR WHEREVER YOU MAKE YOUR COFFEE IN THE MORNING NINETY MINUTES HAFTER YOU WAKE UP THE SORT THING AND JUST GET FIVE OR SO MINUTES BEFORE YOU LEAVE THE HOUSE AND THEN AS YOU EXTENDING TO THE WINTER YOU'DNOGNOT TO BE NEURODIC ABOUT INCREASING THE DURATION EVERY DAY YOU COULD ACTUALLY THE WAY THES INTHES SLOW INTEGRATING CLOCKS A WORK YOU GUD ACTIAL EVEN JUST HOLD IT A LITTLE BIT CLOSER EACH DAY DON'T BURN YOUR EYEBALS OUT UM A LITTOEAT CLOSER EACH SDABLUT ESSENTIALY IFO YOU JUST DOSE YOURSELF WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE BRIGHT LIGHT EARLY IN THE DAY AS YOU EXTEND INTO WINTER THAT WILL ESSENTIALLY TRICK THE THE MELATONAN SYSTEM INTO THINKING THAT YOU'RE GOING FROM EIGHT HOURS INTO TEN HOURS OF LIGHT AS OPPOSE TO EIGHT HOURS INTO SIX HOURS OF LIGHT VERY SIMPLE AND IF YOU CAN'T GET ONE OF THESE NINE HUNDRED LUCKS TABLETS OR SOMETHING ELF A WEBSITE THEN YOU COULD DO THIS WITH ANY BRIGHT INCADESCENT BALB UM SHOULD WORK I AGAIN JUST BE CAREFUL NOT TO PUT IT DIRECTLY AGAINST YOUR EYEBALL NEXT QUESTION PLEASE HIW DO INCREASED IN ORAL PLASTISY WELL VISIT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING I SHOULD HAVE SAID EARLIER WHICH IS THAT ULTIMATELY WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE TRIGGERING NEURAL PLASTICITY THROUGH ELEVATED FOCUS OR WHETHER NOT YOU'RE TAKING HYDO SYLLICIVE AN YOUR BUSINESS NOT MINE UM AND WE COAN TALK ABOUT PSYCHODELICS IF YOU WANT UM JUSTY CRIMINALIZED AND CALIFORNIA ARE SOON TO BE DECRIMINALIZE 'LL BE LER ENTHUSIASTIC YE HAD THE ONE THING I'VE DO I'VE BEEN PRETTY A VOCAL ABOUT MY BELIEF THAT THE DATE ARE REALLY INTERESTING TO SAY THE LEAST ABOUT UM NOT MICRODOSING BY THE WAY THERE THERE'S NOT A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT MICRODOSING IS USEFUL I'M NOT SAYING IT'S NOT BUT THEY'RE NOT ALOUT OF CLINICAL TRIALS SO SHOWING THAT BUT THE TWO MACRODOSE WITH WITH EFFECTIVE THERAPEUTIC SUPPORT UM TRIALS ARE VERY ENCOURAGING NOT JUST FOR MAJOR DEPRESSION BUT ALSO FORE VERY SEETING DISORDERS ALCOHOL I USE TICEORDER WHICH IS BY THE WAY THAT THE TERM THAT PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO SHIFT TO AS SUPPOSED TO ALCOHOLISM OR ALCOHOLICIS NOW ALCOL EUSTICE ORDER UM WHICH IS NOT TO BE POLITICALLY CORRETURAL JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT WHEN THEY'RE TALKING ABOALCOL EUSTICE ORDER AH WHETHER NOT SYLICITEN WHETHER NOT TM D M A WHETHER NOT IT'S FRUSTRATION BR OUGHT ABOUT BY YOUR INABILITY TO PLAY AN INSTRUMINET AND TE IN DETERMINATION TO TO DO SO IT'S IN THE END IT'S ALL ABOUT DEPLOYMENT OF THE NEUROMODULATORS NERMODULATORS BEING SOME COMMINATION OF DOPOMINE CERATONAN A A SEAT OF COLINE OR APINEFRON AGAIN USUALLY IN COMMINATION WHAT'S VERY CLEAR IS THAT THE NEUROPLASTIC OF EFFECTS OF EM D MA THE NEUROPLASTIC EFFECTS OF SYLL SITEN ARE BROUGHT ABOUT BY HUGE INCREASES IN SERATONE THIS IS ALSO CAN HELP US UNDERSTAND WHY FOR SOME YEARS AND TO SOME EXTENT TILL NOW IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THE ASSESSARISE THE SELECT OF CERATONA REEPTIC INHIBITORS WOULD BE GOOD TREATMENTS FOR DEPRESSION I THINK SOME PEOPLE BY THE WAY HAVE EXPERIENCED TREMENDOUS RELIEF FROM THE ACCESSORISE WE DON'T WANT TO DEMONIZE THEM ALL AT THE SAME TIME IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT DEPRESSION IS NOT SIMPLY LOW LEVELS OF CERATONEENT THAT'S ALSO NOT TRUE UM HENCE WHY THERE'S EFFECTIVE IN SOME PEOPLE INTO DEPRESSENCE LIKE PROPRIREN THAT INCREASE DOPAMINE AN EPINEFERON AND AND NOT CERATONEN THE POINT HERE IS THAT THESE NEUROMODULATORS AS THEY'RE CALLED ALLOW FOR WHAT THEY ALLOW FROM MODULATION OF SINAPSES WHICH EFFECTIVELY ALLOWS FOR NEURO PLASTICITY MEAN ULTIMATELY WHETHER NOT IT'S THROUG TALK THERE BE CUNDOLINI BREATHING A OU NO HYDOSYLICID BAN EMDY MA OR THE COMMINATION WHICH I THINK IS CALLED A HIPPY PLIP UM NEVER DONE IM TOGETHER I CONFESSED NEVER DONE HIM TOGETHER UM BUT HAVE DOM UM IT WITH A CLINATION BY THE WAY IN LEGAL S THI CIRCUMSTANCES AND NOT A LOT UM A NOT NOT OFTEN THAT IS UM IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT IT'S OPENING WINDOWS FOR PLASTICITY NOW IT'S INTRIGUING IF WE'R GOIN TO JUST TALK ABOUT PSYCHODOLICS FOR A SECOND IS WHY A DRUG LIKE EMDYAMA WHICH INCREASES DOPOMI WHICH BY THE WAY EMDYAMA IS METHLIN DIOXY MET HEM FEDAMI TOLLIN ANYBODY TELL YOU IT'S OM LINGER IT'S MATH IT'S MATH BUT IT'S METH WITH A LOT OF SERATONEAN THROWNE IN THEIR TOO BUT IT'S METH AND IT'S CLEAR THAT FOR THE TREATMENT OF PITIESTI IT HOLDS PROMISE IT'S NOT ABSOLUTELY SAFE I ESPECIALLY RE PEOPLE CARTY AT CONDITIONS AND YOU IF YO'RE GOING TO GO DOWN THAT PATH YOU WANT AN NEED A A SKILLED GUIDE AND THIS IS WHE I THINK THE LAWS ARE REALLY GOING TO HAVE TO AM PAY CAREFUL ATTENTION TO WHAT WHO AND WHAT IS A SKILL TO GUIDE LOOKAT A AND WHEN IT COMES TO SULSIVON THE SERETONAN INCREASE IS WHAT EFFECTUALLY CAUSES BROADER CONACTIVITY IN THE BRAIN WHAT'S INTERESTING IS TAT BOTH OF THOSE DRUGS INCREASE PLASTESY MAINLY THROUGH INCREASES IN SERATONE ABUT WORKING ON DIVERY DIFFERENT RECEPTERS SAY DIFFERENT TYPES AND OUTPUTS OF PLASTESY WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME IS THAT BECAUSE I'M A STRONG BELIEVER THAT CHILDREN SHOULD NOT BE DOING PSYCHODELICS NOR SHALL WE BE GIVING CHILDREN PSYCHODELCS IS THAT THE THE INCREASES IN CONACTIVITY IN THE BRAIN THAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCE OF PLAYING A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT OR IDEALLY AN INSTRUMENT WITH OTHERS AS A CHILD MIMIC A LOT OF THE BROATER SCALECONACTIVITY SO TO CALL SO CALL RESTING NETWORK CONACTIVITY THAT OCCURS WHEN PEOPLE TAKE PSYCHODELIC AS ADULTS IN OTHER WORDS AND I CAN'T EMPHASIZE THIS ENOUGH AND AGAIN I FAILD AT MUSIC MISERABLY I'LL TELL YOU STORY ABOUT THAT I A SECOND BUT S GETTING KITS TO PLAY AN INSTRUMENT IS IT'S VERY CLEAR INPROVES THEIR ABILITY TO LEARN ALL SORTS OF THINGS FOR THEIR ENTIRE LIFE IS JUST SO SO IMPORTANT I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT THIS ARE WHO TO SHOUT AT OR TALK TO ABOUT KEEPING THE ARTS ACTIVE AND IN SCHOOLS AS AN PHYSICAL EDUCATION BUT THE IDEA THAT WE WOULD JUST TRAIN KIDS IN MATH AS JUST FRIGHTENING BECAUSE IF YOU WANT THEM TO BE TRULY GOOD AT MATH AND SCIENCE YOU ALSO HAVE THEM PLAY INSTRUMENTS BY THE WAY WHEN I'S A KID ITPLAY THE VIOLIN MY PARENTS MADE ME WAS NOT THE INSTRUMENT AL OUR PLAYING WE HAVE ONLY ONE PICTURE ANSTHEY TAUGHT ME THE SZOKI METHOD IS WAS O LEARN B EAR AND THERE'S ONE PICTURE AND ALL THE OTHER KIDS HAVE THEIR BOWS UP AND MY BOW IS DOWN AND I'M STANDING HERE ON THE STAGE AND MY FLY IS DOWN AND I AND THAT AND LITERALLY THE NEIGHBORS DOG HOWLD AND I QUIT AFTER THAT CONCER SO I WAS TROMATIZED BU THEY SHOW ME THE PICTURE MY SISTER TEASE ME RELENTLESSLY UM SO NORPLASTICITY FIGURE OUT YOURE CHOICE WAY TO INCREASE A NERMOGULATOR LIKE CERTONEIN ORE HAVE BEEN AFFERINASEE TO COLIN UT DON'T MEAN I HONESTLY WOULD NOT ENCOURAGE PHARMICALOGIC WERE PSYCHADELIC APPROACHES AS YOUR PRIMARY ENTRY POINT I REALLY DON'T I THINK THAT THERE'S A PLACE FOR THAT AND CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THAT WOULD NOT BE THE PRIMARY ENTRY POINT NEXT QUESTION PLEASE WHAT TYPE OF MOVEMENT PROTOCALLED YOU RECOMMEND FOR SOMEBODY IS WORKING FROM HOME SITTING BEHIND THE CONPETER FROM EIGHT A M TO FIVE P M OH UM O KET WOLL COUPLE THINGS I MEAN I CAN MAKE ALL SORTS OF RECOMMENDATIONS LIKE GET UP EARLY AND YOUNO MOVE AND IF YOU CAN TAKE BRAKES AND WALK THIS SORT OF THING BUT BUT LET'S IT LET'S ASSUME THAT ALL OF THAT IS IS KIND OF UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE CERTAIN FORMS OF EXERCISE THAT WE SHOULD ALL BE DOING THREE I THINK NOW IT'S ARY CLEAR BASED ON THE BEAUTIFUL WORK OF PETER TA WHOSE BROTHERIS IN THE AUDIENCE BY THE WAY TO NIGHT YEH YE E'S GOT A YOUNGER BROTHER YEU'VE GOT A YOUNGER BROTHER COYOU LAGIR PETER A TEA WAS YOUR OLDER BROTHER IMAGINE BE PRETTY COOL THE UM I SORT OF ADOPT PEOPLE AS SIBLING THEY DON'T KNOW IT BUT I DO BI JUST ASSUME PETER WAS MY OLDER BROTHER RETURNS OUT HE HAS A YOUNGER BROTHER ALREADY UM AND PETER'S ESSENTIALLY A HAMMERED HOME THE TRUTH WHICH IS THAT WE SHOULD ALL BE GETTING SOMEWHERE WE TON A HUNDRED FIFTY O TWO HUNDRED MINUTES OF SO CALLED ZON TOO CARDIO WEREWE'RE WALKING A LOT AND WE'RE MOVING ABOUT WHERE WE CAN JUST BARELY HOLD A CONVERSATION I KNOWST PEOPLE IN TRO SEEM TO WALK A LOT SO THAT'S GREAT UM AND THEN THREEDAYS A WEEK OR SO RESISTANCE TRAINING AND THER BUNCH OF OTHER MOBILITY THINGS THAT WE SHULD LL DO SOTAT WE DON'T FALL IN BREAKER HIPS COSETTES WHERE ANOTHER BONE CAUS ITS ANONTHER WAY THAT PEOPLE REALLY LIMIT THEIR HELF SPEN AN LIE SPENT AND SO ON AND SO FORTH BUT TWO THINGS THAT CAN MAKE BEING AT A DESK WHICH I LOATHE EVEN HOUGH I LIKE TO LEARN I HATE SITTING STILL A YOU CAN DO THE STANDING DEST THING I DO THAT BY STACKING BOXES THE OTHER THING THAT WAS INTERESTING DID ANY ONE SEE THE STUDY OUT OF THE UNIVERSOF TEXAS WHO WAS IN HUSETON THIS LAST YEAR ABOUT THE SOLLIEST PUSH UP DID THEY WOULT SEE THIS THIS AS PRETTY INTERESTING SO THE SOLLIEST THIS IN WIDER FLAT MUSCLE BELOW THE GASTROCTAMIUS OF THE CALF IS A REALLY UNIQUE MUSCLE IN THE HUMAN BODY IT'S ONE PERCENT OF THE TOTAL HUMAN MUSCULATURE BUT IT HAS AN ABILITY WAT WE'LL SOON BE FOR OBVIOUS REASONS TO A DRAMATICALLY SHIFT FUEL UTILIZATION IN THE BODY BUT THEY DID IN THE STUDY WAS THEY HAD PEOPLE WHO WERE SITTING FOR OU THREE OR FOUR HOURS A DAY JUST SIMPLY RAISE THEIR HEEL SEEMS ALMOST SILLY REA THEY CALL THE SOLIEST PUSH UP WHEN I CALLED AT THAT ON LINE I LITERALLY GOT A CACK BY THE JIMBROWS TELLING ME THAT'S A SEEDED CALF RAYS O GE YOU KNOW INENI WH O GE NO WONDER THEY YOU KNOW THIS ULPERO SIENCE THING GETS GODEDE ON'T YE LL GET REALLY AGGRESSIVE THEY LIFT THEIR HEEL AND THEY PUT THEIR PUSHING THEIR TOW DOWN AND SOME PEOPLE THING OF IT IS BALANCING THE KNEE BUT IT'S REALLY ABOUT PUSHING THE TOW DOWN AND LIFTING THE HEELS SO THEY JUST SIMPLY HAD THESE SEDENTARY PEOPLE DO THIS HEEL RAYS AND WHAT THEY SAW WAS THAT THERE WAS A DRAMATIC HIGHLY STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN BLOOD GLUCOSE UTALIZATION AND REDUCTION IN IN BOTH INSOLENT LEVELS DURING THAT ACTIVITY AND AROUND THE CLOCK REALLY INTERESTING WHAT THEY WERE DOING WAS MIMICING SOME ASPECT OF WALKING NOW IS IT AS GOOD AS WALKING NO BUT IF YOU ARE STUCK BEHIND A YOU KNOW WORKING FROM HOME SITTING BEHIND THE COMPUTER FROM EIGHT A M TO FIVE P M GETI WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT PEOPLE GETTING INTO THIS UNCONSCIOUS PATTERN OF LIFTING THEIR HEEL OVER AND OVER AND SHIFTING BACK AND FORTH MIMICED A LOT OF THE EFFECTS OF WALKING IT'S NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR EXERCISE BUT THE SHIFTS IN GLUCOS AND INSOLEN IU'LT PUT AN UTILIZATION SGEEVES ME UTALIZATION AN OUTPUT RESPECTIVELY AH WE'RE WE'RE VERY IMPRESSIVE AND THIS A GROUP DOWN THE IVERSY OF HUSE A YOURESY OF TEXAS AND USTON IS STARTING TO INCORPORATE THIS INTO PEOPLE WHO HAVE LIMITED MOBILITY AH AND IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE OTHER LIMB MOVEMENTS CAN DO THIS THERE'S SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT THE SOLLIEST IT WAS DESIGNED IN AIRQUOTES AM TO BE A MUSCLE THAT'S USED REPEATEDLY OVER YOU KNOWT EXTENDED HOURS OF TIME AND HAS THIS UNIQUE PATHWAY OF FUIL UTILIZATION SO IS IT GOING TO CUROBESITY NO BUT IF YOUR STUCK BEHIND A DESK THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING USEFUL I HAVE THIS LITTLE FIDGET THING UM I WAS TOO LAZY TO BUILD ONE BUT A I FOUND ONE ON LINE FOR COUPLE BOX WE'RE YOU JUST WHEN YOU STAND AT YOUR DUSK AVE JUST OU CUN A KICK IT BACK AND FORTH I WON'T SEENLESE IT  CANQUELL THEN YOU JUST CAN KICK THEM BACK AND FORTH AND SOME PEOPLE TREAD MILL AT THE DESK I CAN'T DO THAT I KCAN'T DO THAT MANY THINGS BUT I ALSO M STILL LIKE WORKIN ON THIS ONE I CAN'T CAN'T QUITE DO THAT A NEXT QUESTION PLEASE MY MORNING MEDITATION CONSISTS O OQUET AND THEN I THINK WE'RE ABOUT OUT OF TIME BUT THE UM YES O MY MORNING A MEDITATION IS NOT REALLY A MEDITATION IT'S A PERCEPTIAL EXERCISE AND AMTHAT PERCEPTIONAL EXERCISE IS HAS A WEIRD NAME CAUSE I GAVE IT A WEIRD NAME UM I THEN I DIDN'T INTEND TO SOUND MISTICAL NIG DON'T WANT CREDIT FOR IT BUT I CALL IT SPACETIME BRIDGING BUT IT'S NOT THAT WHAT IT REALLY IS IS THAT THE TO ME ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IS OUR ABILITY TO ORIENT INDIFFERENT TIME DOMAINS TIS GETS A LITTLE BIT ABSTRACT BUT WE KNOW FROM STATES OF HIGH STRESS THAT WE START FINE SLICING TIME WE KNOW THIS RIGHT THE WORLD BECOMES LIKE A SLOW MOTION VIDIO BECAUSE FRAME RATE HAS INCREASED WE HAS A VISUAL VISION ERAL SCIENTIS I CAN TELL YOU AT IN MY LABORATORY WE WERE DOING STUDIES WITH VIRTUAL REALITY WHERE WE CAN CRANK UP PEOPLE'S LEVEL STRESS BY GIVING THEM CERTAIN VISUAL STIMULY AND THEN THE'RE ABILITY TO PARSE INFORMATION IS CLEARLY INCREASING IN THE TIME DOMAIN THE'RE FIND SLICING MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT A SLOW MOTION BIDIO SOMEBODY DONKING A BASKATBALL OR SOMETHING THAT SORTS BECAUSE THE FRAME RATE WENT UP  SO WHEN WE ARE IN HIGH ALERTNESS STATES OR FRAME RATE INCREASES WHEN WE'RE VERY RELAXED OUR FRAME RA DECREASES SO FOR YOUR RIC RUBENING IN YOUR LYING THERE LOOK AT THE SKY YOUR FRAME RATE IS PROBABLY SLOWER THAN IF YOUR HYPER FOCUSSED ON OMIGANIS YOU KNOW AM LEKE YOU SIT LI IMAGINE A DREADFUL SITUATION WHERE SOMEBODY SENDS YOU ATTEX MESSAGE LET'S MAKE IT POSITIVE SOMEBODY'S HAVEN'T A CHILD IN YOUR FAMILY AND YOU LIKE YOU KNOW IS IT HEALTHY YE RMOMIN DABIO K DMAMIT SECONDS FEEL LIKE MINUTES MINUTES FEEL LIKE OURS BECAUSE YOURE FINE SLICING TIME  AND TH MOMBABYOUR FINE O KAKRATE A HAPPY STORY ENDIC GREAT SO WHEN WE'RE VERY RELAXED WE TEND TO BEEN TIME MORE BROADLY NOW IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM AND YOUR PERCEPTION OF TIME OR INEXTRICABLY LINKED SUCH THAT IF YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES AND YOUR FOCUSSED ON YOUR INTERNAL STATE YOU ARE FINE SLICING TIME AND THE SECOND HAND IF YOU WILL IS MORE OR LESS TH THE MECTRONOME RATHER IS YOUR BREATHING OR AND YOUR HEART RATE FROM COMBINED WHEN YOU OPEN YOUR EYES AND YOU LOOK AT SOMETHING IN YOUR IMMEDIATE ENVIRONMENT WHEN YOU MOVE FROM SO CALLED INTERRECEPTION TO EXTRA RECEPTION YOU START YO YOUR PERCEPTION OF TIME SHIFTS FAIRLY DRAMATICALLY AND YOU NOW PERCEIVE TIME ACCORDING TO BELIEVE OR NOT THE SPEED OF IMAGES MOVING IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT RELATIVE TO YOU AND THEN AS YOU LOOK OUT FURTHER ON TO SAY THE HORIZON YOU EXTEND THE TIME DOMAIN EVEN MORE IF YOU THEN IMAGINE YOURSELF  IN THE WHOLE GLOBE YOU EXTEND YOUR TIME DOMAIN EVEN MORE SO MY MORNING MEDITATION IF YOU WILL TO MORROW A PERCEPTIOAL EXERCISE IS TO STEP THROUGH THESE DIFFERENT TIME DOMAINS TO CLOSE MY EYES AND FOCUS ON MY INTERNAL STAY OPEN MY EYES AND FOCAS ON SOMETHING CLOSE BY LOOK AT FURTHER LOOK A BIT FURTHER THINK ABOUT TO MYSELF ON AT ON THE GLOBE THE WHOLE WORLD MOVING TO YOU REALLY EXTENDING YOU'R SPACE DOMAIN AND THEN THE TIME DOMAIN EXPANDS WITH IT OUKOWN THIS IT COMES UP WHEN YOU SEE THESE LITTLE MEANS OF YOU KNOW ANY TIME YOU'RE WORRIED JUST REMEMBER YOU'RE A LITTLE DOT ON A LITTLE BLUE DOT SPENDING IN THE UNIVERSE THE OTHIS KIND OF THING BUT YOU DON'T THINK THAT WAY WHEN YOU'RE STRESS YOU'RE THINKING I'M THE BLUE DOT YOU'RE THE PROBLEM WHATEVER YOU KNOW I WANT THAT YOU NYOURE NOT THINKING SO THIS PERCEPTIAL EXERCISES AWAY OF TRAINING THE NERVOUS SYSTEM MY NERVOUS SYSTEM TO SHIFT DELIBERATELY BETWEEN THESE DIFFERENT TIME DOMANS AND FOR ME IT'S BEEN VERY USEFUL FOR IMPROVING TASK SWITCHING SOMETHING THAT AS YOU PROBABLY HAVE NOTICE I'M NOT VERY GOOD AT I GO INTO THE TRENCH I DON'T LEAVE THE TRENCH VERY EASILY AH SO THAT'S BEEN VERY USEFUL AND IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THIS IN MORE DETAIL THERE'S A WONDERFUL BOOK UM CALLED A THE SECRET PULSE OF TIME AND THERE'S A HITCHCOCK MOVY THIS DISCUSSED IN THAT BOOK WHICH THE MOVI IS ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE MINUTES LONG AND DURING THE COURSE OF THAT MOVI THE BACKROUND ACTUALLY INCLUDES RISING AND SETTING OF THE SUN AND A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT SPEEDS OF MOVEMENT AND INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE CHARACTERS AND YOU'RE PERCEPTION AT THE END OF THE MOVI IS THAT A MUCH MUCH LONGER PERIOD OF TIME OCCURRED BECAUSE OF S UNCONSCIOUSLY YOUR BRAIN WAS PAYING ATTENTION TO THESE CIRCADIAN SIGNALS AND THESE OTHER SIGNALS IN ABSOLUTLY FASTING M IN HITCHCOCK NOT O YOU CITCHCOCKFOHIM BUT NOW I AFTER SEEING THAT AS I WHILE THAT'S GENIUS HE CAPTURED THIS SPACETIME THING WHAT YOU SEE OUT THE WINDOW IS IN ONE TIME DOMAIN IN THE ROOM IS A DIFFERENT TIME DOMAN I WON'T TELL YOU HO KILLED WHO BUT IT'S VERY VERY INTERESTING AND SO THE POINT BEING THAT WHEN YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM IS UP CLOSE FOLKSING ON THINGS UP CLOSE OR INTERNALLY YOU'RE YOU'R FINE SLICING WHEN YOU FOLK SOMETHINGS FURTHER AWAY YOU'RE MORE BROADLY FOCUSSING AND SO ON AND SO FORTH SO THAT'S A MORNING MEDITATION I DO IT ONLY PERCEPTIONAL EXERCISE HENLY TAKES ABOUT A MINUTE OR SO AND THE OTHER THING IS THAT ON THE MONITORS THEY'RE FLASHING NOW THAT WAS YOUR LAST QUESTION SO I I WANTED TO SAY A COUPLE OF THINGS BEFORE WE GO FIRST OF ALL THANKS TO ALL OF YOU WHO IM STOOD OUT THE NIGHT AND FOR THE LONG DURATION I REALIZE THIS STUFF IS LIKE NURTY DETAILED AND A LOT OF OTHER THINGS YOU COULD BE DOING WITH YOUR EVENING IN YOUR TIME AND SO I'M VERY A GRATEFUL THAT AH IT WILL KIM TOGETHER TO NIGHT FOR

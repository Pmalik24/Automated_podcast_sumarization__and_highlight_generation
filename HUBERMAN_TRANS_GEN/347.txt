DOCTOR BECKY KENNEDY WELCOME THANKIEST TO THANIC TO BE  HVE A LOD QUESTIONS FOR YOU AND AS I MENTIONED IN MY INTRODUCTION MUCH OF WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS TO DAY RELATES TO PARENT CHILD RELATING BUT PERTAINS TO RELATIONSHIPS GENERALLY SO PEOPLE WITH CHILDREN WITHOUT CHILDREN WHO DON'T WANT CHILDREN HOWFLLY THERE ARE'T PEOPLE THAT HATE CHILDREN BUT FOR ALL PEOPLE A OUT THERE WITH CHILDREN OR NOT PLANNING THEM OR NOT RELATIONSHIPS ARE REALLY JUST FUNDAMENTAL TO WHO WE ARE IN I ACTUALLY PLACE RELATIONSHIPS INCLUDING RELATIONSHIP TO SELF IN WE NOW THINK OF IS THE SIX PILLARS OF MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE AH SLEEP NATRICIAN NIGHTS ORCIDED RELATIONSHIPS CLEARLY VITAL TO ALL ASPECTS OF LIFE SO LIKE TO START OFF BY JUST ASKING FOR ALL OF US ARE THERE SOME SIMPLE PERHAPS NOT SO SIMPLE QUESTIONS THAT OW WE CAN REFLECT ON THEY GIVE US A SENSE OF YOU KNOW HOW GOOD APPARENT WE ARE OR WOULD BE BASED ON I DON'T KNOW AR OUR PREVIOUS PARENT CHILD RELATIONSHIPS ARE RELATIONSHIP TO SELL OU KNOW THEY WHAT KIND OF THINGS COME TO BEAR WHEN WE THINK ABOUT REALLY HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS I CAN YOU NOW START RATTLING OFF A LIST TOF WHAT I IMAGINE THAT COULD BE BUT WHAT AR YOUR THOUGHTS I WHAT ARE THE WHAT'S THE PERAMETER SPACE AS AS WE SAY SH WE THINK ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS BESIDES JUST O OW MY EITHER LIKE THIS PERSON OR DOWNT DOR I YOU GOOD AROUND ANER I DON'T OR SEPARATIN HOW I FEEL ABOUT THEM VERSES HOW THEY MAKE ME FEEL YOU WE CAN DROW LIE DEEPER BELOW THE THE AND O A MORE SUPERFICIAL STUFF THAT WE OFTEN SEE OBBED THE FIRST THING TAT COMES TO MINE WHEN YOU SAY THAT IS THIS WORD STURDINESS AND TO ME WHEN SOMEONE SAYS LIKE WHAT IS GOOD INSIDE AS AN APPROACH AND THAT'S ALWAYS THE FIRST WORD THAT COMES TO MIND AND I KNOW TIT'S LIKE AN ODD WORDS NOT A WORD WE LIKE USE A LOT ALTHOUGH I DO THINK MOST PEOPLE WHEN YOU SAY THAT PERSONS LIKE A REALLY STURDY PERSON WE ALL OF SOME CONNETATION ORE FEELING AT LEAST OF WHAT THAT MEANS AND I USE IT A LOT BEING A STURDY PARENT BEING A STURDY LEADER I TALK A LOT ABOUT THE SIMILARITIES TO PARENTING AND CAN IT BEING A PILOT OF A PLAN AND IN THAT WORD STURDY AWAYS COMES UP AND SO I MEMBER AA WHILE GO SOME ONE PUSH ME THOUGH WHAT'S YOUR DEFINITION OF WHAT THAT MEANS AND AT THAT POINT I THOUGHT WHY I SU PRY HAVE A DEFINITION GIVEN I I USE IT A LOT BUT WHAT I THINK IT REALLY MEANS IS IN ABILITY TO BE CONNECTED TO YOURSELF AND TO SOME ONE ELSE AT THE SAME TIME WAND I THINK THAT IS REALLY THE DEFINITION OF STURDY LEADERSHIP AND THAT IS THE KEYTHING THAT'S PRESENT IN A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP THAT AT ONCE I KIND OF NO MY VALUES WHAT I WANT WHAT I NEED I FEEL LIKE I CAN BE TRUE TO THAT AND AT THE SAME TIME I CAN AND O CONNECT TO SOME ONE ELSE WHO PROBABLY HAS DIFFERENT WANTS AND NEEDS AND MAY BEVEN SLIGHTLY DIFERENT VALUES AT THE SAME TIME AND THE THINK THAT THAT LEADS ME TO NEXT IS WHAT I THINK WHAT IS LIKE FAMILY JOBS AND A PARENT JOB SO IN ALMOST ANY OTHER PLACE YOU COULD ASSUME IF I'M  GETTING A NEW JOB AT THIS COMPANY LIK THERE JUST NO WAY I COULD DO MY JOB WELL IF I DON'T KNOW WHAT MY JOB IS AND IF YOU GO O YOUR DESK AN YOU'RE BOSSLIKE HAVE A GOOD DAY DO A GOOD JO AND THERE'S NO JOB DESCRIPTION YOU BE LIKE I THINK THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE BUT OVER AN OVER WITH PARENTS IF I SAY TO THEM WHAT IS YOUR JOB WITH YOUR KIT OR WHEN YOUR KITS HAVING A TANTRUM OR THEY HER THEY'RE RUDER THEY LO TO YOUR FACE OR ANYTHING WHAT IS YOUR JOB IN THAT MOMEND MOST PEOPLE VERY WELL INTENTION EDUCATED PEOPLE WHOULD NEVER EVER TAKE A JOB IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE A JOB DESCRIPTION THEY LOOK ME LIKE I HAVE I HAVE NO IDEA SO HOW CAN WE DO IT WELL HOW CAN WE THEN PERFORM INT TO A PLACE TO GET TO THE OUT COMES WE WANT IF YOU DON'T OF THE FOUNDATION OF WHAT YOUR JOB IS AND TO ME II I THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT I THINK PARENTS ACTUL OF TWO JOBS AND IT RELATES TO STURDINESS E YOU'LL CONNECT IT ERE ONE OF OUR JOBS IS BOUNDARIES AND TO ME BOUNDARIES ARE THINGS WE TELL PEOPLE WE WILL DO THEY REQUIRE THE OTHER PERSON TO DO NOTHING THAT'SLIKE REALLY IMPORTANT CAS A LOT OF TIMES WE THINK WERE SETTING A BOUNDARY WHEN ACTUALYWE'RE MAKING A REQUEST AND BOUNDARIES KEEP US CONNECTED TO OURSELVES THEY REPRESENT OUR VALUES AND OUR WANTS AND OUR NEEDS AND IN A PARE CHILD RELATIONSHIP THEY ALSO KEEP OUR KIDS SAFE IF I JUST KNOW IN A SIMPLE WAY LIKE MY CAN WATCHIN OFTEVY TO DAY AND THEY REALLY TO GET TO BED AND I KNOW THAT LIKE I DON'T  WANT THEM TO STAY AP LAD I KIND OF KNOW WHAT MY FAMILY NEEDS IHAVE JUST SAT A BOUNDARY BUT THE OTHER PART OF MY JOB IS I EMPATHY IN VALIDATION WHICH IS A WAY OF CONNECTING TO SOME ONE ELSE WHERE YOU SEE SOME ONE ELSE AS FEELINGS AND EXPERIENCE AS REAL YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THAT PROBABLY YOU DON'T NECESSARILY CONDONE THE BEHAVIOUR THAT'S THE REPRESENTATION OF THE FEELINGS BUT THE FEELINGS THEMSELF YOU NEED TO CONNECT TO AND I FEELIKE THOSE THERE AURE TWO JOBS AS PARENTS AND NOTSREALLY THE WAY TO BE A STURDY LEADER AND TO BE IN A STURDY HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR GETS WALL SO MUCH THERE A AND I LOVE IT A AND HERE'S ONE OF THE REASONS I LOVE IT THIS NOTION OF STURDINESS SOMETHING THAT DON'T THINK WE HEAR ENOUGH ABOUOUT UM IF WE HEAR ABOUT RESILIENTS GRIT  ALSO IMPORTANT TERMS UM BUT STURDINESS AS AS YOU DESCRIBED IT IN THE JOB OF PARENTING UM REALLY SEEMS TO IT INCLUDE A LOT OF UM VERBS NOT JUST NOWNDS AND ADJECTIVES ND AND I'M A HUGE FAN OF VERBS BECAUSE THE BIOLOGY AND TO SOME ISTON PSYCHOLOGY UM YES ALSO PSYCHOLOGY IS ALL ABOUT VERBS I AND SO THE LABELS OFTEN ARE UM MYSTERIOUS BUT STURDINESS YOU KNOW JUST SENDS A A CLEAR MESSAGE OF OF SOMETHING THAT IM DOESN'T BUDGE EASILY IM BUT THEN AS YOU DESCRIBE THE JOB OF BEING APPARENT HAVING BOUNDARIES ID LIKE TO DRILL INTO THAT LOBIT MORE WATHOW YOU VIEW BOUNDARIES I BUT ALSO EMPATHY A IT'S NOT A WALLED OFF UM PICTURE IT'S ONE THAT THAT IS SEMI PERMIABLE UM ALSO  AND I CONFESS OM OF IT OBSESSED WITH UM OLD SCHOOL PSYCHOLANALETIC THEORY NOT AS THE THE THE BE ALL END ALL OF PSYCHOLOGY BUT BUT IT ALSO SUGGESTS UM LIKE THIS OTHER OTHER RELATIONSHIP LIKE I'M A PERSON I HAVE A SELF EUROPE PERSON YOU HAVE A SELF THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF COTOPENDENCY WHERE OBVIOUSLY DEPENDENCY AND TWO PEOPLE BEING CONICOCODEPENDENT CAN BE HEALTHY IN THE CONTECTS OF RELYING ON ONE ANOTHER BUT A AS I UNDERSTAND IT WHEN ONE PERSON HAS A SELF IN ANOTHER PERSON DOESN'T HAVE A SELF FOR THIS NOTION EMERGING NOT JUST IN ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS BUT CHILD PARENT RELATIONSHIPS YOU KNOW I'M BEST FRIENDS WITH MY MARMORDAD IS THAT A GOOD THING I DON'T KNOW BUT THIS NOTION OF OTHER OTHER RELATIONSHIPS YET I MOSELF YOU'RE A SELF AND WE SEEACH OTHER AS AN OTHER UM ANYWAY I I THINK THERE'S SO MUCH TO EXPLORE HERE SO VALUABLE UM YOU MENTION THAT BOUNDARIES ARE SOMETHING THAT WE DO AND THAT THE REQUIRES AT THE OTHER DO NOTHING I WE WILL O IT FURTHER INTO THAT BECAUSE I IT'S A BEAUTIFUL CONCEPT AND UM THIS NOTION OF BOUNDARIES BUT LIKE A GASLITING NARCISISM AND ALL THE OTHER THINGSTHAT WE HEAR ABOUT NOWADAYS I THINK IS IKE OFTEN BADLY MISUNDERSTOOD SO TELL US MORE ABOUT BOUNDARIES AND  HOW THAT LOOKS IN MYOS IN THE ACTION SAID AND THIS IS ALL SO CONNECTED TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT OTHER OTHER RELATIONSHIP I'M A PERSON YOU'RE A PERSON AND SO AMY TIMES THAT'S ACTUALLY IS WHAT GES MERGED AND SO MY KID GET'S UPSET THAT I SAY THEY CAN'T WATCH ANOTHER SHOW AN IN APPARENT REALLY THAT MOMENT THERE WHOSE FEELINGS ARE WHOS LK THEY WERE UPSET WAS I WAS UPSET A SECOND AGO I THOUGHT I SHOULD SET THE BOUNDARY AND I'LL THE SUDDEN O'M CHANGING MY MIND THERE IS THIS COMPLETE ROLL KIND OF CONFUSION AND MERGER WHICH IS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS THAT KID'S GET ACTUALLY REALLY SCARED N ESCOLATE THEIR BEHAVIOUR EX THY DON'T HAVE A STURDY LEADER WHEN THEY REALLY NEED ONE RIGHT SO BOUNDARIES OR WHAT WE TELL SOME ON WE WILL DO AND THEY REQUIRE THE OTHER PERSON TO DO NOTHING I LIKE THIS DEFINITION FOR A LOT OF REASONS I'M TO STRAYE PRACTICAL SO IT ALLOWS ME AFTER I SET A BOUNDARY TILL LIKE A SESS WAS TAT A BOUNDARY OR NOT RIGHT BECAUSE LET'S TAKE ON LET'S TAKE THE T V EXAMPLE IT'S WHATEVFER TIME AT NIGHT MY KID HAS JUST WATCH TO SHOW AND THEY KNOW THEIRE SOS TO WATCH ONE SHOW AND THEN YOU KNOW TURN OFF THE T V I HERE FROM PARENTS A LOT MY KID ISN'T LISTEN OR MY KIT ISN'T RESPECT MY BOUNDARYES ND I'LL SAY WHAT I LIK THAT SOUNDS HARD LET'S GET INTO THAT SO THENELSE I SO I TOLD MY KIT TO SHUT OFF THE T V IT IS KEPT WATCHING IT IS KEPT ON I TOLD MY KID TO STOP JUMPING ON THE COUCH AND THEY HAPT JUMPING THEY DON'T RESPECT MY BOUNDARYES THEY DON'T LISTEN ME THIS IS LIKE A BEAUTIFUL EXAMPLE E THIS IS A PROBLEM MY GRY BUT THIS IS NOT A BOUNDARY PROBLEM YOU MADE A REQUEST OF YOUR CHILD AND FRANKLY IF YOU HAVE YOUR O MAKING US UP SEVEN YOUROLD WATCHING T V I'M NOT SO GOOD AT PUTTING AWAY T V AND APHON AT NIGHT LIKE IT'S JUST HARD FOR ME TO DO SO YOU'RE SEVEN YOUROLD POBBIES JUST YOU KNOW ADDICTED TO WHAT'SEVER HAPPENING ANDWHAT KIND OF ASKING OUR KID TO DO OUR JOB FOR US BECAUS WE DON'T WANT OUR KIT TO BE MAD AT US OR WHATEVER IT IS A BOUNDARY IN THAT SITUATION WOULD BE SAYING OH HEU DON'T PUT OFF THE T V LOOK BY THE TIME I GET OVER THERE IF YOU HAVEN'T TURNED OFF THE T V AND WDON'T WANT TO DO THIS BUT I WILL I WILL TAKE THE REMOTE OUT OF YOUR HAND AND SHUT IT OFF A BOUNDARY SAYING O AFTER MY REQUEST DOESN'T WORK CAN YOU GET OFF THE COUCH YOU CAN JUMP ON THE FLOOR LOOK IF BY THE TIME I GET OVER THERE YOU HAVEN'T COTTON OFF THE COUCH I WILL PICK YOU UP THAT IS  I WAS I'M NOT GOING TO PUT THE SUCCESS OF MY INTERVENTION IN MY LIKE SEVEN YEAR OLD'S HAND I CARE TOO MUCH ABOUT MY OWN NEEDS AN MY OWN ROLL IS I AS A LEADER IN MY HOME TO DO THAT RIGHT SAME THING WITH LET'S AY INLAWS ON MY MOTHER AND LAW DOESN'T RESPECT MY BOUNDARY SHOW WE HO SHOWS UP WITHOUT CALLING NOW WHI DO'T WANT TO GET TO THIS POINT THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS IN A RELATIONSHIP WE CAN DO BEFORE WE GET TO THIS POINT BUT IF THAT'S REALLY A BOUNDARY AND I'VE A VERY AN VF INTRUSIVE MOTHER IN LAW A BOUNDARY WOULD BE SAYING LOK THIS IS GOING TO BE AWKWARD AND I KNOW YOU MEAN WELL BUT THE NEXT TIME YOU COME UNANNOUNCED I WELL COME TO YOUR CAR AND SI OFF THIS TIME DOESN'T WORK FOR US YOU CANNOT COME IN AND I WILL GO BACK INTO MY HOUSE AND CLOSE THE DOOR LIK NOW THERE CAN BE LOTS OF FEELINGS AROUND THAT BUT YOU ARE NOW SETTING A TRUE BOUNDARY AND WHEN WE SAY OUR KIDS DON'T LISTEN THOSE ARE OFTEN SITUATIONS NOT ALL THEM BUT THERE'S A BIG PERCENTAGE WHERE I'M ACTUALLY NOT SETTING A BOUNDARY EARLY ENOUGH AND IN A STURDY ENOUGH WAY WHICH IS WHAT MY KID NEEDS BECAUSE AT THAT POINT THEY SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE SKILLS TO INHIBIT IN URGE AND THEY NEED ME TO BE THE BOUNDARY FOR THEM WE HEARE SOMETIMES IT A KIDS ARE CRAVING RULES THEIR CRAVING BOUNDARIES A AS COUT OF A WILE THAT A LESSEN TEA NAJUR A THE GIL MORE THAN WILD I DON'T RECALL EVER CRAVING RULES I BUT I DO RECALL PAYING ATTENTION TO THEY'RE LACK OF PRESENTS SO WHAT OF THAT AM YOU KNOW IS THIS NOTION THAT KIDS REALLY WANT AND CRAVE RULES AND BOUNDARIES IS THAT IS THAT SORT OF A A ION'NO PROJECTION THAT WE PUT ON TO THEM A AND AND I'ME NOT EXPLORING THIS JUST JUST FOR FUN I'M EXPLORING IT BECAUSE I THINK T ONETHING THAT'S VERY HELPFUL AND SETTING BOUNDARIES ESPECIALY WITH KIDS IS THE IDEA THAT CUSH EVEN IF IT'S A BIT PAINFUL TO SEE THEM IN DISCOMFORT THERE'S THAT EMPATHY PIECE E TALKINGAT FOR THAT IMPATIC ATTUNEMENT KAN IM GET IN THE WAY OF BOUNDARIES RIGHT THESE ARE AND THEY'RE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE BUT THESE ARE SOMEWHAT COMPETING FORCES SET AT TIMES SO IF WE IF WE KNOW IF WE CAN EKNOWLEDGER AT LEAST EXPLORE THIS IDEA THAT RULES ARE DEEP DOWN WHAT THEY REALLY WANT NOT JUST WHAT THEY NEED YES A MAYBE IT WOULD HELP YES AND I THINK BY THE WAY IN MY TAKING YOU KNOW THE REMOTE AWAY AR TAKING MY KIT OFF THE COUCH IS TO BE CLEAR IF I DO THAT TO MY KID LIKE THEY ARE NOT GOING TO SAY OF MOM YOU ARE THE BEST MOB IN THE WORLD BANK YOU THEY ARE GING TO CRY AND SCREAM AND THAT'S WHERE BOUNDARIES AND EMPATHY THOSE TWO PARTS OF OUR JOB ACTUALLY DO ALWAYS GO TOGETHER I THINK THEY'RE ACTUALLY PARTNERS THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY AT ODDS BECAUSE AS SOON AS MY KID IS UPSET WHAT I WOULD SAY TO THEM IS ITOH YOU WANTED TO JUMP ON THE COUCH IT'S NOT AS MUCH FUN ON THE FLOOR O YOU REALLY WANTED TO WANCH ANOTHER SHOW YOU DIDN'T EVEN WANT THIS BIG YOU WANTED TO WANCH IT THIS BIG IT SOUNDS CRAZY CAUS YOULICLY WHY MY EMPATHIZING WITH THAT FEELING THEY JUST KIND OF DISOBEYED KNOW THEIR TWO DIFFERENT THINGS I'M DOING MY JOB AND SETTING A BOUNDARY THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOING THEIR JOB AND FEELING TEIR FEELINGS THAT'S ACTUALLY THEIR JOB THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN EVER LEARN TO REGULATE A FEELING IS THROUGH FEELING THE FEELING SO THEY'RE DOING THEIR JOB NOW 'M GING A BALADAY AND THIS IS HOW KIDS LEARN EMOTION REGULATION BOUNDARIES THEY FEEL I VALIDAY I HOLD THE OUNDARY OVER AND OVER AND OVER SO DO KIDS CRAVE RULES AND I I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES IS THAT MOST PARENTING APPROACHES HAVE ONE OR THE OTHER AND I THINK THEY'RE BOTH VERY IN COMPLETE STRATEGIES IF YOU JUST LEAD WITH RULES RIG IN WHO SET IT OF HEY WASN'T MELIK BUT IS IT RULES WITHOUT RELATIONSHIP LEAD TO REBELLION YET THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS RIGHT SO THAT'S NOT GOOD BUT I SEE THE STANARGE WE'VE SWUNG THE OTHER DIRECTION IT IS ALSO NOT A COMPLETE PARENTING STRATEGY WHEN YOUR KIDS JUMPING ON THE COUCH TO DO NOTHING IF YOU THINK THAT'S DANGEROUS INTO THEY OH YOU REALLY WANT TO JUMP JUMP JUMP AND SUCH BIG FEELINGS LIKE THISS NOT WHAT KIDS NEED I THINK KIDS CRAVE BOUNDARIES AND TEY CRAVE FEELING SEEN AND UNDERSTOOD BECAUSE AS KIDS ARE GROWING UP LIKE I THINK THE QUESTIONS THEY'RE ALWAYS ASKING PARENTS EVEN THOUGH OF COURSE THEY NEVER SAY THIS IS JUST AM I REAL AND AM I SAFE EVERY INTERACTION THAT FEUHTHE'RE ASKING US THE REASON WE'VE DE VALIDATE THEIR FEELINGS WHEN THEY'RE UPSET EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE SO UPSET JUST THAT THEIR STRING CHEES PROKE WHATEVER IT IS IS FEELINGS DON'T HAVE MARKERS LIKE BLOOD OR LIKE THEY DON'T KNOW AND SO WHEN WE SAY AH YOU WANTED YOUR STRING CHEES TO BE TOGETHER WHAT WERE REALLY SAYING IS THE THINGS YOU EXPERIENCE INSIDE OF YOU ARE REAL BUT KIS ARE ALSO DESPERATE TO KNOW LIKE HOW FAR DO THINGS GO NO ONE LIKES TO FEEL BOUNDARY LESS AS A KID THAT'S TERRIFYING RIGHT AND SO WHEN WE SET OF BOUNDARY WE ACTUALLY SAY TO A KID LIKE I WON'T ALWAYS PROTECT YOU LIKE I WON'T LET THINGS GET SO FAR OUT OF CONTROL SO I DO THINK I KNOW FITS RULES BUT KIDS RAVE CONNECTION AND I THINK BOUNDARIES AND KIND OF VALIDATION AND EMPATHY THEY ARE THE TWO FORMS OF CONNECTION THAT KIDS YO ARE REALLY DESPERATE FOR WHAT ABOUT REWARDING KIDS AND HERE RATHER THAN IM START OFF BY ASKING YET ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO REWARD KIDS IN HEALTHY WAYS IT I WILL ASK THAT IN A MOMENT UM HOW CAN WE U EVALUATE THE NOTION OF OF REWARDS OR INSENTIVES UM THROUGH THIS LENDS OF STURDINESS BOUNDARIES AN EMPATHY YE UM BECAUSE YOU KNOW I CAN IMAGIN YOU KNOW OF REWARD THAT'S OUTSIZED IN COMPARISON TO WHAT A KID DID YOU KNOW 'LL GET GRAT YOU KNOW YOUYOU TOOK YOUR PLATE TO THE KITCHEN SINK AFTER DINNER UM YOU KNOW YOU GET TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OBVIOUSLY OUT OF SCALE EXTREME EXAMPLE BUT JUST BY WAY OF EXAMPLE UM YOUN 'T SCRUP THEI REWARD MECHANISMS FOR FOR FOR LIFE IF YOU ASK ME EVERYTHING I KNOW BYT REWARD IN ROPLASCICY SAYS THAT THAT THAT WOULD OCCUR BUT BUT THIS IDEA THAT YOU KNOW U CAN SENTIBMIS KIDS IF IF YOU TURN OFF THE TEVY NOW THEN YOU DEFINITELY CAN WATCH TO MORROW NIGHT WEREAS IF YOU DON'T YOU CAN'T TLLI SEE YOU SUBMERGING REWARD IN POTENTIAL PUNISHMENT U YOU KNOW IT HOW DO WE BOUND REWARDS UM AND HOW DO WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT WHEN WE START ADDING REWARDS TO CENARIOS THAT THAT WERE WERE MIXING IN MATCHING LIFE EXPERIENCE FOR THEM YOU KNOW A KIS TON NOW DOING WHAT I'M TOLD DO I ALWAYS EXPECT A REWARD UM IF THE RWARD DOESN'T COME NEXT TIME WE KNOW BASTOM REWARD PREDICTION ARA WE TEND BE WORSE OFF EMOTIONALLY THAN HAD WE NEVER RECEIVED YOUR WARD IN THE FIRST PLACE AGAIN PRETTY PRETTY VAST PERAMETER SPACE BUT WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ON BEST WAYS TO REWARD KIDS FOR STANDARD GOOD BEHAVIOUR YE VERSES ACHIEVEMENT VERSES A LIMINATION OF BAD BEHAVIORYE THEY SO THO I THIN REGOUTED I THINKS YOU'RE ASKING A MUCH BIGGER QUESTION FER OMINA I THINK YOU ARE WHICH IS LIKE WHAT WHAT WHY DO PARENTS THINK WE NEED TO REWARD KIDS I THINK THAT'S WHY DO WE THINK WE NEED TO PUNISH KIDS AND THIS IS ACTUALLY WHERE EVERYTHING I WORK ON STARTED FROM BECAUSE THE WAY I WAS TRAINED TO WORK WITH PARENTS I WENT TO YOU KNOW THE BEST GOLD STANDARD EVIDENTE BACE PROGRAM AND KNOW WIS ALL ABOUT TIME OUTS AND PUNISHMENTS AND REWARDS AND STICKERS AND IGNORING AND PRAISE AND AND HONESTLY WE DURING THE TRAINING FOR THE YEARS AFTER I CAN OF PRACTICE THIS WAY MY I FEE LIKE THAT YOU KNOW THIS BETTER THAN I AM SI SION EVEN SAY THIS BUT LIKE THAT LEFT PART OF MY BRAIN LODGIC AND LINEARITY I JUST LIKE THIS AMAZING O MIK GINNIS WORKN I GET MORE OF THE GOOD BEHAVIOUR AND WORK AND NOT GET THE BAD BEHAVIOUR AND AND I'D START TEACHING THIS DEPARENTS MY PRIVATE PRACTICE AND THERE IS THIS LITTLE THING IN ME I DON'T EVEN IT HOUSNO AND GET LOUDER AND LOUDER TO THE POINT THAT IN A SESSION I LITTERLY SAID TO  PARENT IN FRONT OF ME I WAV JUST LIKE TELLING THEM HOW TO DO A TIME OUNT IS THAT I'M SORRY I I DON'T BELIEVE ANYTHING IVE BEEN TLLING YOU ASLITTERT I SAID CAUSE I JUST IT WAS SO LOUD AND THERE IT WAS OBVIOUSLY SUPER AWKWARD BUT IT LED ME TO I FEEL IT FROM THIS FIRST PRINCIPLES WAY BE LIKE THERE ARE A MILLION ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE HAVE ABOUT RAISING KIDS AND I THINK ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS AND IF I JUSTRIPED THEM BACK WHAT WOULD I BE LEFT WITH AND WHAT WOULD BE A NEW BUILDING FROM THERE AND REWARDS AND LIKE PUNISHMENTS TO ME ARE THESE ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE HAVE SOMEHOW CONVERTED FROM LIKE THE FICTION SHELF OF THE LIBRARY AND MY MIND TO LIKE THE NON FICTION SHELF AS LIKE TRUTHS AND I THI KIND OF RAIL AGAINST ALL OF THEM SO I THINK I THNK THE QUESTION IF THAT SO CAT TON ON THAT DIRECTION TO ME AS A WHY DO WE THINK WE NEED TO REWARD KIDS AND IS THERE ACTUALLY A BETTER SYSTEM BOTH SHORT TERMAN LONG TERM I'M INCREDIBLY LONG TERM GREEDY IN MY PARENTING APPROACH AS AT THE END OF THE DAY EIGHTEEN ENOUGH IS WHERE THINGS REALLY MATTER NOT REALLY MATTER I MEANTEY ALL MATTER BUT I'D RATHER YOUN I WANT TO HELP MY KIDS BECOME SURTY RASILIENT ADULTS BUT I'M SHORT FRM GREEDY TOKE SOME AR REALISTS LIKE I CAN'T DEAL WITH LIKE ALL THESE DIFFICULT MOMENTS YOU GET BOTH FOR SURE WITHOUT REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT MIGKT SOME ONE TELL ME THEY GIVE RE REWARD FOR DO WAN TO USE THE LIKE CLEARING THE TABLE OR EXAMPLE LET'S ART THAT THERE A KIND OF GOES BACK TO LIKE BELIEVING KIDS ARE INHERENTLY GOOD INSIDE I REALLY THINK IT GOES BACK TO THAT YOU REALLY BELIEF KIDS ARE INHERENTLY GOOD INSIDE WHICH BY THE WAY WHEN I STRIP BACK EVERY ASSUMPTION THE ONLY THING I WAS LEFT WAS THAT LITERALLY THE ONLY THING AND THEN I START TO THINK OKA SO IF THEY'RE GOOD INSIDE WHY DO THEY DO SO MANY ANKNOING THANKS LIKE ALL THE TIME BUT THAT GAVE ME A GAP AND I FEEL LIKE THAT IS VERY EXCITING TO HAVE A GAP LIKE WHY DO PEOPLE WHO ARE GOODNCIDE DO SUCH BAD THINGS RI ADULT SOR KIDS AND TO ME WRITE KIDS ARE BORN WITH ALL THE FEELINGS AND NONE OF THE SKILLS TO MANAGE THOSE FEELINGS LIKE PERIOD AND WE'VE OFTEN THOUGHT THEREFORE WHEN FEELINGS FEELINGS WITHOUT SKILLS COME OUT AN BEHAVIORS I THINK THAT'S WHAT BAD BEHAVIORS ARE FEELINGS OR URGES OR SOMETHING WITHOUT A SKILL TO MANAGE THEM OR WITHOUT ACCESS TO THE SKILL MAY BE IN THAT MOMENT EITHER WAY AND THN WE END O PUNISHING BEHAVIOR BUT THE BEHAVIOUR WAS JUST A SIGN OF THE LACK OF SKILL SO I CAN'T IMAGINE ANY ONE THINK ING I COULD TEACH MY KID TO SWIM BY PUNISHING THEM FOR NOT SWIMMING LIKE I THINK SOME ONE WOULD SAY THAT WAS CRAZY IM AND BUT THAT'S KIND OF HOW WE RAISE KIDS AND THEND WE THINK REWARDING THEM IS NIN BE EFFECTIVE BUT IT ACTUALY LEADS OVERAN OVER WHAT YOU SET I'VE SEEN THESE PARENTS OVERN OVER MY PRIVATE PRACTICE MY FOURTEEN RALD LITERALLY WON'T PICK UP THEIRE CLOTHES FROM THE FLOOR UNLESS I GIVE THEM FIVE DOLLARS I COTIT I GET HERE AND LIKE YE THAT'S THAT'S THE PROBLEM BUT I SAW HOW THEY GOT THERE SO LET'S TAKE CLEARING YOU KNOW THAT THEIR PLATE I I KNOW THIS IS GON TO SOUND CHEESY BUT KIDS DO HAVE SOMETHING IN THEM WHERE THEY WANT TO FEEL LIKE A PURPOSEFUL MEANING FUL PART OF SOCIETY THEY DO IMPACT DRIVES ADULTS AND IT DRIVES KIDS IT'S NOT THE SAME TYPE OF REWARDING AS PLAYING FORTNIGHT IT'S  TOLALLY DIFERENT SISTEM BUT I THINK THE QUESTION ISN'T WHY DO WE THINK WE HAVE TO BRIBE KIDS UR YOU KNOW KIND OF THE TRICK THEM INTO DOING THINGS THAT ARE KIND OF LIKE BASIC PARTS OF HUMAN LIFE AND SO IF WE TAKE THAT AND MY KID CHRONICALLY ISN'T CLEARING THEIR PLATE I COULD SAY THEM LOOCK EVERY TIME YOU CLEAR PLATEMEN GIVE YOU STICKER AFTER FIVE STICKERS YOU'REGING TO GET I DONT KNOW WHATEVER IT IS TO ME LIKE A MUCH MORE DESEFFECTIVE WAYS I'D SAY TO MY KID H I KNOW YOU KNOW LIKE CLEARING A PLATE IS JUST ONE WAY OF BEING PART OF THIS FAMILY AND TAKING CARES IF I KNOW YOU KNOW THAT WERE ON THE SAME TEAM I SAY THT FOR IT ERE ON THE SAME T RIGHT WE ARE IM  SOMETHING'S GETTING IN YOUR WAY OF REMEMBERING I'M NOT ASSUME I LIKE TO THIK THE MOST GENEROUS INTERPRETATION THAT TO ME A ALLOWS YOU TO SEPARATE SOME ONES BAD BEHAVIOUR FROM THEIR GOOD IDENTITY THAN MY SAY WHAT WOULD HELP YOU REMEMBER WE LITERALLY DID THIS HEN MI SON WHO ALWAYS HAD HIS TOW ON THE FLOOR AND I WAS JUST LIKE I BUT HE JUST DOESN'T REMEMBER HE LITERALLY DOESN'T SEE IT WE TALKED ABOUT IT N HE WE HOUHT TO HIM PUTTING A POST IT LITERALLY SOMEMING SIMPLE LIKE A POSTIT ON MY DOOR THAT JUST AYS PICK UP MY TOWEL HE WROTE IT IN HIS OWN HANDWRITING RIGHT RIN A FACILITATE HIM LIKE SOLVING HIS OWN PROBLEMS AND NOW HE HAS A MUCH HIGHER RAT OF PICKING UP HIS TOWEL LIKE I GUSS I COULD HAVE SAID EVERY TIME YOU PICK UP YOUR TOWEL YOU'LL I DON'T KNOW GET A DOLLAR WHATEVER IT IS BUT AGAIN IT MAKES ME THINK I'M NOT BUILDING THE GENERALIZABLE SKILL THAT WAY I'M JUST KIND OF OFFERING SOMETHING AT THE END WHICH SETS ME ON THIS KIND OF AWFUL CYCLE THAT I THINK IM MIS IS A POINT I LIKHT TO THINKE A BRIEF MOMENT AND THINK ONE OF OUR SPOLSERS AND THAT'S A G ONE AGY ONE IS A VITAMENMINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT ALSO CONTAINS ADOPTITIONS I SORT TOF TIKING AGOU ONE AWAY BACK INTO THOUSAND AND TWELVE THE REASON I STARTED TAKING IT IN THE REASON I STILL TAKE IT EVERY DAY IS THAT IT INSURES THAT I MEET ALL MY QUOTAS FOR VITEMENS AND MINERALS AND IT INSURES THAT I GET ENOUGH PRBOTIC AND PROBIODIC TO SUPPORT GOT HEALTH NOW GOD HEALTH IS SOMETHING THAT OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS WE REALIZE IS NOT JUST IMPORTANT FOR THE HEALTH OF OUR GOD BUT ALSO FOR OUR MUN SYSTEM AND FOR THE PRODUCTION OF NEURO TRANSMITTERS AND EUROMODULATORS THINGS LIKE DOPEMING AND CERATONENT IN OTHER WORDS GOD HEALTH IS CRITICAL FOR PROPER BRAIN FUNCTIONING NOW OF COURSE I STRIVE TO CONSUME HEALTHY WHOLE FOODS FOR THE MAJORITY OF MY NUTRITIONAL INTAKE EVERY SINGLE DAY BUT THERE ARE NUMBER OF THINGS IN A G ONE INCLUDING SPECIFIC MICRO NUTRIANTS THAT ARE HARD TO GET FROM WHOLE FOODS ORE AT LEAST IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES SO A G ONE ALLOWS ME TO GET THE VITEMENS AND MINERALS THAT I NEED PROBIOTICS PREBOTICS THE ADAPTAGONS AND CRITICAL MICRONUTRIANTE SO ANY TIME SOMEBODY ASKS ME IF THEY WERE TO TAKE JUST ONE SUPPLEMENT WHAT THAT SUPPLEMENT SHOULD BE I TELL THEM A G ONE BECAUSE AG ONE SUPPORT SO MANY DIFFERENT SYSTEMS WITHIN THE BODY THAT ARE INVOLVED IN MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE TO TRY A G ONE GO TO DRINK A G ONE DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMEN AND YOU'LL GET A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMAN D THREE K TWO AND FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS OF AG ONE AGAIN THAT'S A DRINK A G ONE DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMEN I LOVE THE IDEA THAT KIDS WANT PURPOSE UM AND IT MI CORRECT IN WONDERING IF THAT GOES BACK TO THIS AN MI REAL COMPONENT OF THE AM I REAL AM I SAY YES THIKE ONE WAY THAT WE KNOW WE ARE REAL IS OUR ABILITY TO IN PART CHANGE ON THE WORLD AROUND US IN DO ONT GET TOO ABSTRACT HERE BUT YOU KNOW AS A NUR SCIENTISTS HAVE OFTEN SAT BACH REFLECTED LIKE ALL THE EMOTIONS WE FEEL TA NO ONE SEES THAT ER KNOWS THAT U MUST WE SAY SOMETHING WE WRITE SOMETHING WE SING SOMETHING WE SHOUT SOMETHING IN ALL THE FORMS OF EXPRESSION JUST LIKE NONE OF OUR A OUR DREAMS ARE CREATIVE A INSIDE SORT OR WISHES AM EXIST EXCEPT INSIDE US UNLESS WE TRANSMUTE THEM INTO SOMETHING IN THE REAL WORLD SO THERE DOS SEEN TO BE SOMETHING ABOUT HAVING THIS NERVOUS SYSTEM FROM A TIME WE REALLY ON LIKE IT IT SEEM OUR EFFECT ON THE WORLD THAT THAT REALLY MAKES US REAL AND ON OTHERS AND A I LOVE THE IDEA THAT WELL AND I MUST SAY I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE IN MY HEART AND I JUST FEEL IT AS A FEELING THAT KIDS ARE INHERENTLY GOOD INSIDE II JUS I CAN'T IMAGINE ANY OTHER VERSION OF THAT BUT DOES I MEAN THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO BELIEVE THAT KIDS ARE INHERENTLY BAD OR WERE AT LEAST NOT GOOD I DON'T MEAN THAT AT LIKE HOW COULD THAT BE BUT THEN AGAIN MAKE MABE I'M JUST NAIVE  I DON'T NO IF ANY ONE CONSCIOUSLY BELIEVES THAT BUT WHEN I GO BACK TO THAT SYSTEM AT IS FIRST TRAINED AND REWARDS AND PUNISHMEN SIKE IT FEELS I A SYSTEM OF BEHAVIOUR OF CONTROL AND TO MEAN THEY EV ILY SIDE ABOUT CONTROL AND TRUST IS OPPOSITES SO I ONLY CONTROL WHAT I DON'T TRUST SO NOBODY SAID TO ME THAT PROGRAM BI THE WAY BACK  VI BEING AR LEARNING HERE WE BELIEVE KIDS ARE BAD NSIDE AN SO WE DO THIS THING BUT WELL IF I DON'T TRUST MY KID AND IF I DON'T TRUST THEY INHERENTLY HAVE THE THINGS IN THEM TO DO GOOD BY THE WAY THAT'S NOT CAN A HAPPEN NATURALLY THAT'S WHY WE'VE A BIG JOB IS APPARENT TO COACH OUR KIDS TO BRING THAT OUT IS AT BOUNDARIES WHEN THEY CAN'T DO IT AND SOM ME OTHER THINGS BUT I DON'T BELIEVE ANYONE WOULD SAY YODS CAUSE THEIR BADINSIDE BUT THERE IS A NATURE WERE YOU'RE CONSTANTLY INTERACTING WITH YOUR KID FROM THATS OTHEIR SYSTEM LOOKING AT THEM LIKE DON'T TRUST YOU I DON'T TRUST YOU AN WHEN YOU DO BAD THINGS I CAN NOT HOLD ON TO THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE A GOOD IDENTITY THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING YOU A PUNISHMENT THAT'S WHY IAM SENDING YOU AWAY TO YOUR ROOM AND SO IF I'M REFLECTING BACK TO YOU CONSTANTLY THAT YOU ARE JUST YOUR LAYDIST BEHAVIOUR THAT I DON'T TRUST YOU THAT I KIND OF HAVE TO BRIBE YOU TO DO VERY BASICK HUMAN THINGS WELL OUR KIDS FORM THEIRE IDENTITY FROM OUR REFLECTION OF THEM AND SO THEN WORK THIS IS WHAT REALLY COMPELLED ALL THISM MIKE WE'RE RAISING GENERATION AFTER GENERATION OF KID KIND OF SENDING TO THEM LIKE YOURE KIND OF A BAD UNTRUSTWORTHY KID AND THEN WE WONDER WHY WE HAVE SUCH HIRATES OVE LIKE MASSOF ENT ALL PROBLEMS WON'T LIKE I I THERE'S SOME LINIARITY THERE A CURIOUS ABOUT THIS NOTION OF IMPINGMENT I'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS UM YOU DON'T THIS IDEA THAT YOKNOW WHEN WE'RE YOUNG WE'RE FORAGING LIFE DECIDING YOUN TO I LIKE THE WAY THIS TASTES OR NOT TASE YOU KNOW BY THE WAY I STILL HATE ANCHOVIES I DON'T NEED TO BE ASK AGAIN TO KNOW THE ANSWER BUT WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG YOU KNOW WE'RE ENCOURAGE TO DO THINGS LIKE EAT YOUR BROCHLY TASTE THE ANCHOVY AND SOME PARENTS IT SEEMS ARE VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THE IDEA OF ALLOWING THEIR CHILDREN TO HAVE THEIR FEELINGS AND THEIR WISHES HER THEY'RE AS I WAS SAY THE NERVOUS SYSTEMS SEEMS TO BE DIVIDED INTO YUNG YAXS AN MET MES I YESS THE PLER WILL BE ME A YOUG YACSAN MIS I AMINT'S MORE COMPLICATE IN THAT BET LIKE WITH PEOPLE WERE  LIKE  I REALLY LIKE THEM ERE NOW SOMETHING'S OFF THEY ARE LIKE YOU KNOW AM SO'S NOT THAT MUCH MORE NEU ANCS THAN THAT THE BRAINS GOT TO MAKE DECISIONS AFTERWARD AFTER ALL EXCUSE ME SO UM YOU KNOW KIDS HAVE THEIR YOUNS YUXS AN M AND THEN WE'VE GOT AR  OUR IDEAS ABOUT BUT THEY NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO PROGRESS THROUGH LIFE OFTEN INHERITED FROM OUR PARENTS AND HOPEFULLY MODIFIED BY THE WONDERFUL WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING IND WRITING ABOUT IN IN YOUR YOUR PROGRAMM AM THEN WE'RE TALKING BOUT HERE BUT YOU KNOW HOW MUCH SPACE SHOULD WE ALLOW FOR KIDS TO BE UNIMPINGED LIKE LIKE YOU DON'T ANT EAT YOU DON'T WANT Y WHET WERE  FOR DINNER LIKE O GET I'M NOT ON TO COCUAN ENTIRE Y  NOU DINNER BUT THEN I GUESS LIKE YOU MIGHT GO TO BED HUNGRY SOUNDS HARSH RIGHE UM BUT THE OTHER VERSION IS O KATE WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE FOR DINNER WELL I PREFER LET' SAY THEY PICK A HEALTHY OPTION THEY PREFER POSTA NOT CHICKEN CAND WE WON'T DO THE ICE CREAM CHICKEN AN YOU KNOW A THING AM DO WE DO IT RI LIKE HOW MUCH IN PINCHMENT I DON'T WANT TA WATCH A MOVY WITH THE FAMILY I WANTN'T PLAYIN MY ROOM YOU KNOW AT SOME LEVEL YOU NI'VE HEARD IT BOTH WAYS THAT IM PINGEMEN IS NEEDED FOR SAFETY AN LIFE PROGRESSION BUT THERE'S TIMES WHEN IT IT'S IT'S MORE SUTTLE THAN THAT IT'S NOT ABOUT SAFETY IN LIFE PROGRESSION'S NOT ABOUT GOING TO SCHOOL OR NOT GOING TO SCHOOL HOMEORK IN A HOME WOR GETS ABOUT LIKE FYOU WANT TO COME WITH US TO THE PART YOU WON'T PLAY AT HOME RUM HOW OFTEN SHOULD WE IN PINGE AM HOW WE KNOW IM HIS IT THIS KIND OF THAT THE TRICKY THE TRICKY ARYIS APPARENTING THAT I THINK AM BECAUSE IT DOESN'T ALL INTO THE EXTREMES YE I LOVE THIS QUESTION THAT'S A WORD I DON'T OFTEN HERE ACTILLY WHAT IN PINGEMEN LIKE CAN YOU ACTLY WHAT LIKE LIKE IM PANCING ON EYES I LIKE IMPINGING ON THE CHILDS IN A THEY WINHERENT NATURAL DESIRES OR AVERSION TO THINKS GOT I RI LIKTLY SAY WE'RE GOING OVER SO INSO'S HOUSE AND THEY SAY YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE THEIR KIDS  DON'T LISTEN YOI LEARN TO PLAY WITH OTHER KIDS ING NO I ON LIKE THEIR KIDS YOU SEY HAS SOMETHING HAPPEN AND SO WERE NOT SALING ABOUT A DANGEROUS SITUATION IEITHING NOW I DON'T LIKE I JUST REALLY WANTED TO STAY HOME YE THIS IS AN AREA THAT SO ARE WE GEN IMPINGE ON THERE  BECAUSE WE'RE TEACHING THEM EITHER WAY WE'RE TEACHING THEM SOMETHING YOVEYOU GOT A DO STUFF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO EVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT AN WEE HERE AGAIN WE'RE RULING OUT THE POSSIBLY THAT THERE SOMETHING UNSAFE ABOUT THE ADMIREMENT YET PSYCHOLOGYO THERE PHYSICALLY UNSAFE OR BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE TEACHING THEM A PAY YOUR I SEE YOU I HEAR YOU BUT YOU KNOW YOUR DESIRES MIGHT NOT BE RIGHT THERE THERE'S ASHY IT A KIND OF AN LIKE A TACIT MESSAGE OF THE WAY YOU FEEL MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST GAGE OF WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU WHICH SENDS A COMPLICATED MESSAGE TO A KID TOTALLY SO THIS IS AGAIN WHERE I THINK I COULD INSIDE LIKE FAMILY JOBS ARE SO USEFUL FAMILY JOBS TO ME WHEN I USED TO ME WITH PARENTS AND LIKE THEY DESCRIBE A SITUATION AND I FEEL LIKE NINETY PECENTD THE TIME THAT'S WERE I START BECAUSE THEN THAT FLOWS FROM THERE SIKE A FRAMEMARK SO REAY WHAT IS MY JOB I'M THE ONE WHO SETS BOUNDARIES LIKE I AM THE ONE WHO MAKES KEY FAMILY DECISIONS IBE SE AS OURE KIDS GOOD OLDER THEY THEY SHOULD BE MAKING SOME DECISIONS TO NO ONE LIKES TO FEEL CONTROLED BUT KEY DECISIONS AND MY JOB IS TO VALIDATE MY KID'S EXPERIENCE THIS IS ACTUALLY COMPLICATED BECAUSE AGAIN OVER AND OVER WE THINK THAT VALIDATING MY KID'S EXPERIENCE MEANSTHEY'RE GING TO DICTATED DECISION MY BOUNDARIES DON'T DICTATE MY KID'S FEELINGS AND MY KID'S FEELINGS SHOULD NOT DICTY MY BOUNDARIES THE'RE JUST TWO EQUAL THINGS SO THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE MY KITCHLY YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE PLAYING WITH THOSE KIDS AND I CAN I TO STAY HOME WITH LEST YO SAY GRANDMA WAS HOME CAN I TO STAY HOME HOW MI GOI TO THINK IT SOME PORTICLE AS A FAMILY BUT MY KIT DOESN'T WANT TO GO THERE'S NOMETHING DANGEROUS  TO ME THIS IS THAT EXACT WAY PUTTING FAMILY JOBS INTO ACTION SWEETY E AND TO ME THIS PHRASE I WISH EVERY PARENT COULD SAY THE STAIR KID I BELIEVE YOU DOYOU WANT TO MAKE A KID FEEL REAL AND CONFIDENT FOR LIFE CONFIDENCE COMES FROM THE EXPERIENE OF BEING BELIEVED CAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU I FROM ME CONFIDENCEIS SELF TRUST SNOM FEELING GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF IT'S SELF TRUST I REALLY DO KNOW THE WAY I FEEL SO LHAT SAY I SAY TO MY SON AND THA SITUATION AND IT'S I BELIEVE FEEL I SI TO I BELIEVE YEEL LOOK I I KNOW YOU WANT NO PLAYFABLE ALL DAY AND THE KID AROUND YOUR AGE HATES FOOTBALL LIKE THAT UT PRIBBY LOWEST ON YOUR LIST OF TYPES OF KIDS YOU'D WANT TO HANG OUT WITH FOR THE AFTERNOON I TOTALLY BELIEVE YOU AND AN THIS FAMILY WE KNOW THAT SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO DO THINGS WE DON'T LOVE TO DO WE DO THAT FOR A FAMILY EXPERIENCE I SAS TO MY KILLTIM OU DON ALSO JUST TO END UP BEING A GOOD ADULP YOU JUST HAVE TO END A PRACTICING AS A KID DOING THINGS YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THINGS THAT ARE BORING THINGS THAT AREN'T YOUR PREFERENCE SO YOU KOW YOU NOT'H IN YOUR BELT FOR THAT  YOU DOREN'T TO THANK ME AND AND ALSO I KNOW YOU HAVE IT IN YOU TO DO YOUR BEST TO BE POLIHTE AND ENGAGE LIKE I JUST I KNOW YOU'RE A GOOD KID AND THIS ISN'T WHAT YOU WAN AND I KNOW WOE'RE GOING TO GET THROUGH IT NOW IF IT'S REALLY HARD MAY BE YOUNG HEY LET'S CREATE A SIGN LIKE CAN YOU LOOK AT ME AND GO M WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR KIND OF AT THIS AND AN ME AND YOU ORE GOIN TO GO TO THE BAFTHEROOM I MEN TO GIVE YOU A HUG AND VINAMINTO SIGHT I KNOW THIS ISN'T WHAT YOU WAN AND WHEN WE GET HOME WE CAN WATCH THAT FOOTBALL GAME WHATEVER IT WAS RIGHT BECAUSE WHAT WE OFTEN DO AS WE LEAVE OURSELVES WITH TWO CHOICES WITH KIDS WE EITHER SAY FINE TO STAY HOME THEYR FEELINGS ACTUALLY JUST DICTATED THE DECISION THAT'S NOT HOPEFUL FOR THEM I DON'T WANT MY KID TO LEARN IN LIFE WHEN I DON'T WANT TO DO SOMETHING PEOPLE TWIST AND TURN TO MAKE THAT THING NOT HAPPEN LIKE THAT'S DISTURBING FOR ADULTHOOD EXPECTATIONS BUT THEN WE DO THE OTHER THING WHICH IS LIKE YOU'RE SO SELFISH JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE O A FRIEND YOU'RE AGE DOES IT MEAN THAT YOU CAN'T COME WITH US SO WE EITHER LET THEIR FEELINGS DICTATE OR WE THINK OUR BOUNDARIES KIND OF GIVE US THE RIGHT TO BE MAD AT OUR KID RIGHT LIKE TO DO BOTH IS SO IMPORTANT AND SO THAT'S WHA IT THINK TO ME WHEN I HEAR HIM PINGMENT LIKE I ACTUALLY THINK THAT'S ETHAT IS THE EXACT SPACE WHERE YOU HAVE THE MOST BANG FOR YOUR BOX APPARENT LIKE IT'S NOT ENJOYABLE AND AGAIN IF I HAVE MY BEAUTIFUL INTERVENTION WITH MY SON DO NOT THINK MY KID WELL LOOK AT ME AND SAY I LOVE HOW YOU EXPLAIN THAT THATWAS SO BEAUTIFUL NO HE'S GEEN TO ROLL HIS EYES MY JOB IS NOT TO TAKE THE BAT AUSE I'MIN DULP AND TO ALSO HOLD HOPE I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THIS COMCONS OP O INVALIDATING MY KID'S FEELINGS WHERE THEY ARE TO DAY BUT I NEED TO BE THE ONE TO HOLD HOPE THAT THEY CAN COPE WITH IT IF I CAN'T NAME TO MAKE IT I KNOW YOU'RE GOIN TO GET THROUGH IT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SEE THAT KIND OF NEXT MORE MATURE VERSION OF THEMSELVES EN I ACTUALLY GITS THE SAME AS YOU'R BEST POSS YOU KNOWS LIKE I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO GO ON THIS TRIP I AND WHATEVER IT OES I KNOW THIS PRESENTATION TOPIC ISN'T THE ONE YOU WOULD HAVE CHOSEN AND THERE WERE TEN THINGS AND THIS WAS LITERALLY NUMBER TEN I TOTALLY GET THAT AND IT STANKSON I'M NOT TAKING ANYTHING AWAY FROM THAT AND THIS IS THE THING AND YOD  DO AND I KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT YOU LIKE WHEN YOU PUT YOUR MIND TO SOMETHING YOUWE'S TO A GREAT JOB AND LIKE IT'S PROBABLY NOT CING TO BE ENJOYABLE BUT I DO KNOW YOU'RE GONG TO DO A GREAT JOB ON THIS LIKE THAT'S LIKE THE BOSS YOU WANT AMAZING ARE YOU A DOPTOR CHILDREN BYTHE I ISHE F I FINISH COLLEGE AS ISHE SHO I LI CANZETTER AND DRI GALA DO SHALL DRI A WHAT I'M HEARING IS DON'T DICTATE THEIR BEHAVIOR WITH AN I'M CAN UNDERLINE IN BOLD DICTATE DON'T DICTATE THEIR BEHAVOR YOU'RE GOING TO DO THIS BECAUSE I SAID SO THAT'S DICTATORSHIP BUT AT THE SAME TIME DON'T QUASH THE EMOTION BEHIND THE RESISTANCE CAN ACKNOWLEDGE IT MAKE THEM FEEL REAL U I BELIEVE YOU HILL I LOVE THIS PHRASE AMAZING AND I LOVE YOUR DEFINITION OF CONFIDENCE IF PEOPLE DIDN'T HEAR THAT WE'RE DEFFLING IN REPEATED AGAIN AND WIGANE WIGEN ATCH IT IN YOUR NERL CIRCUITRY CAUSE I LOVE THAT IT'S IT'S IT'S A SELF TRUST YES AND THIS NOTION OF GIVING HOPE YOU'RE GIVING THEM AND INSENTIVE THAT'S BASED ON A REWARD THAT'S ACTUALLY GOOD FOR THEM THAT THEY CAN TRANSLATE TO OTHER SITUATIONS AS WELL AH WAH UM N THERE AND REWARD BECAUSE YOU DON'T MADE ME THINK I DIN'T THINK TILL YOU SAID BOUT LIKE I THINK IT A SITUATION MEU BE TEMPTED TO SAY LIKE AND IF YOU GO IN YOU'R POLITE I'LL GIVE YOU TWENTY EXTRA MINUTES OF FA BLOCKS FRIGHT THAT'S LIKE AND AT FIRST OF ALLOW ME TO SAY SOMETHING LIKE WHATEVER I SAY TO YOU LIKE FOR LESTENERS LIE GUS I LI CULD DO THE STUFF ALL THEMY ACTUAL KIDS I'M THE FIRST ONE SOMETIMES IF YOU LIKE HERE'S YOUR THING I'VE TO DANGLE AN OD A LITTLE SECTION IN THE COMMON SECTION ON YOU TWO WHERE YOUR KIDS CAN AND I'M JUST GAN EXACTLY YOUR KIDS ARE FORBIDDNT KNOW WHO A THAT'S WAIK THAT'S DICTATING UNDERSTAND WHY I BELIEVE THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO COMMENT  WEGAN A TRUST  WE CNT LET YOU KNOW WHY IT'S A IT'S GOOD FOR YOU IF YOU DON'T N EXACTLY ALL PRACTICES ON SOME ONE ELSES CIT'S A REWARD LIKE THE RE WHEN YOUR KID ANDS UBSEEING THEMSELF CAPABLE OF DOING SOMETHING THEY DIDN'T PREVIOUSLY THINK THEY CAN DO  YOU KNOW BETTER THAN YE LI I FEELIKE THAT IS LIKE ONE OF THE THE'S REWARDS EVEN IF ITS GETTINGTHROUGH A SOCIAL SITUATION OR I THINK ABOUT THE SALAT WITHTHIN NON MY LITTLE KID IS I DON'T KNOW LIKE STRUGGLING WITH A PUZZLE OR SOMETHING AND I COULD JUST DO IT FOR THEM OR IF I HELP THEM KIND OF REGULA OUFICE IS A HARD PUZZLE AND YOU CAN TAKE A BREAK IE I JUST KNOW YOU'RE IN A FIGERE INOW TO DAY I JUST KNOW IT AND THEN BECAUSE OF THAT THEY GET THERE THAT FEELS IN YOUR BODY LIKE THAT IS THE BEST KIND OF REWARD AND ITS THE TYPE OF REWARD THAT WORKS FOR KIDS IN ADOED WHEN THERE AREN'T A JOB WE WANT THEM TO BE MOTIVATED BY THE FEELING THE'RE GAN A HALF OF FRIDE NOT BE SAYING HAY IVE FINISHED MY THING EARLY DO I GET ABONIST TO THEIR BOSSIC THAT THAT'S NOTKIN TO PLAY OUT AS WELL WELLIT I UM I'M JUST PAUSING AND SHAKING MY HEAD ON'T BECAUSE I LOVE IT SO MUCH AM AND I JUST ONE TO MAKE SURE THAT I DON'T QUICKLY MOVE TO THE NEXT QUESTION WITHOUT DRILLING DOWN EVEN DEEPER INTOSAMITY'S CONCEPTS UM I BELIEVE YOU AS THE FEED BACK A WILL RESPONSE THAT CAN IN STILL REAL CONFIDENCE OVER TIME UM NOT TO GET TO NEU ANCS HERE BUT HOW IS IT DIFFERENT BECAUSE I I SINSE IT IS DIFFERENT THEN I HEAR YOU I HEAR YOU BUT AND  DIIS ANY YEH WHAT I HEAR YU BUT LISTEN IN THIS FAMILY THAT IT IS YE UM I BELIEVE YOU ATHEWORD BELIEVE IS POWERFUL AND I BELIEVE TIS REAL POWER IN SPICIFMIC WORDS AS IS YOU  LIKE FOR INSTANCE STURDINESS AGAIN AT SUCH  SUCH A POWERFUL UNDER USED WORD I BELIEVE YOU MUM WOUTD YOU YEUR PSYCHOLOGIST WHAT WHAT WHATD YOU THINK WE'RE HEARING WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS I BELIEVE YOU THAT'S DIFFERENT THEN I HEAR YOU I'VE EN LISTEED THESE OUT BUT I THINK WE ALL OF THESE LI CORNEEDS IS HUMANS AND I THINK BEING BELIEVED IS ONE OF THEM BECAUSE IT'S IT'S SOME ONE ELSE KIND OF SAYING U YOU'RE REAL THAT'S WHAT I I MIGHT NOT FEEL WHAT YOU'R FEELING BUT THAT THING THAT FEELS STRONG TO YOU THAT NOBODY CAN SEE OR MEASURE IS REAL AND WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE MOST CONFIDENT PEOPLE LIKE I THINK ABOUT THIS GIRL IF I WENT TO DOKE WITH AND SHE WAS JUST BRILLIANT LIKE SO SMART WEARE IN THIS SEMINAR IRE WAS ONE THESE SMALL CLASS OF I THIS PROFESSOR WAS LIKE TALKING ABOUT STUFF AND LIKE I FOR ONES IT LIKE I'M NO I DONT'S PERSONS TALK MADAM BUT LIKE I WAS LIKE NO ONE ELSE'S STOPPING AND THIS GIRWAYSE YER HAND AND SHE'S SAIS I'M SORRY IF EVERYONE ELSE IS ANNOWING LIKE I'VE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LIKE AUSTHERE ANY CAUSE I USUALLY DO AN LIKIS OR ANY WAY YOU COULD SAY THAT IN DIFFERENT WAY THAT IS LIKE TO ME THE UTMOST VERSION OF CONFIDENCE THAT SHE BELIEVED HER OWN EXPERIENCE OF CONFUSION WAS REAL CONFUSION SHE DIDN' THINK IT WAS A SIGN SHE WAS STUPID SHE SHE BELIEVED IT SHE BELIEVED HERSELF THAT IS SO CONFIDENT AND I THINK ONE SOMEONE SAYS I HEAR YOU THEY'RE THE'RE THEY THIS LIKE AVERSION OF LISTENING THERE'S MANY WORSE PHRASES NO DAMAGE IS DONE WHEN WE FOLLOW ANYTHING BUT BUT WE TEND TO INVALIDATES THAT'S NOT THAT ANYWAY I BELIEVE YOU BUT IS ALSO NOCKIN BUT THERE'S A MILLION EXAMPLES OF THIS TO ME THAT BUILD CONFIDENCE AND I ACTUALY THINK THERE'S SO MANY SITUATIONS WITH KIDS WERE THEY SAY SITUATIONS AND WE WERE H THEY HAVE LOW CONFIDENCE AND THEN WE INTERVENE TO QUOTE MAKE THEM FEEL BETTER WHICH ACTUALLY IS THE THING THAT LOWERS THEIRE CONFIDENCE CAUSE IT'S LIKE WE SAY TO THEM I DON'T BELIEVE YOU YOU'RE NOT REALLY FEELING YO REAL WHERE I BELIEVE YOU IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE SO LIKE I LIKE GOUVE EXAMPLE CAUSE IT MAKES IT CONCRETE LIKE MY KID WILL COME HOME AND SAY IM I DON'T KNOW I'M I WAS PICK LAST FOR YOU NOW FOR DODGE BALL TO TA I WAS PICK LAST IN SOMETHING AND AND THERES THEYRE CLEARLY VERY VERY SAD RIGHT AND WE WANT O SAY TO THEM I IT'S NOBIG DEAL OR EVERYONE'S PICKLASS SOME TIMES OR REMEMBER YESTERDAY YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE PICK FIRST FOR BASKET BALL AND WE THINK LIKE ANNEED TO BUILD UP MY KID'S CONFIDENCE THOSE ARE CONFIDENCE I WOLT TAY DESTROYING US TO REDUCING INTERVENTIONE CAUSE A KID IS KIND OF COMING TO A ARENT BASELY SAYING I'M A VERY VERY UPSET THAT I WAS PICKED LAST AND WE'RE SAYING TO A KID KNOW YOU WEREN'T AND THEY'RE LIKE BUT I AM AN WHAT THEY LEARN IS THIS IS REALLY TERRIFYING TO ME IS OTHER PEOPLE ORE BETTER FEELERS OF MY FEELINGS HAN I AM AS LIKE A MILLION REALLY SCARIENTO PERSONAL I THINK RELATIONSHIP YOU NOW KIND OF CONSEQUENCES LATER DOWN LET EM LATER DOWN IN LIFE BUT WHEN A KID SAYS I YOU NOTS PICK LAST N NOW WHAT EVEN WANTS ME AND THEY ALL THINK ON THE WORDS APPY WHATEVER IT KID SAY TO SIT AND SAY SOME VERSON OF LIKE EM SO GOD WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS AND I TELL THOSE A REALLY HARD JIM CLASS AND SWEET ALIN I I BELIEVE YOU YOU WILL WATCH YOUR KID IT IS CRAZY TO ME WHAT PARENTS TELL ME HAPPEN WHEN THEY SAY THOSE WORDS THEIR KIDS THEY'RE LIKE IT ALSO JUST LIKE LITTERLY DIFFUSED EVERYTHING ANDTHY WERE LIKE READY TO MOVE ON LIKE THEY ARE JUST TRYING TO TELL YOU PROBABLY LIKE I WAS FEELING SOMETHING IT WAS A LOT IT WAS CONFUSING Y ARE FEELINGS R ALWAYS HARDEST WHEN WE'RE ALONE IN THEM SO I WAS ALONE IN IT AND BRING IT TO YOU HEN SOME ONE SAYS I BELIEVE YOU NOT ONLY ARE THEY GIVING YOU THAT CORN NEED THEY'RE ALSO JUST I THEY'RE LIKE SITTING DOWN WITH YOU IN IT AND THAT THAT MAKES EVERYTHING BETTER AND THEN MEANWHILE WHAT A KID FEELS LIKE WHEN WE SAY I BELIEVE YOU TO A HARD EXPERIENCE OR HARD FEELING IS THO A THE FEELINGS THAT OVERWHELM ME DON'T OVERWHELM MY PARENTS THEY CAN TOLERATE IT THEY'RE NOT SCARED OF ME KIND OF BEING A LOSER IN JIM CLASS ONE DAY AND IF MY PARENT LIKES ME WHEN I HAVE THAT FEELING I GOT I CAN START TO LIKE MYSELF WHEN I HAVE THAT FEELING IT'SO GRAVE BECAUSE IT SOUNDSI IT ACCOMPSHES BOTH THINGS IT MIKES KIDS FEEL REAL AND SAFE YES REAL AND SAFE AND OU I KAN'T HEP BUT ASK SAY BECAUSE IT YOU KNOW HOW WE STARTED OFF TO DAY WAS AT THIS IS IN JIUST ABOUT PARENT SHILD RELATIONSHIPS BUT IN FRENDSHIPS IN ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS AND CO WORK ER RELATIONSHIPS THAT THE WORDS I BELIEVE YOU AF TO PRESUME BASE ON EVERYTHING I'M HEARING NOW AND FEELING INSAD ABOUT IP THAT IT'S EQUALLY EFFECTIVE HUGE Y KNOW YEARS A GOS ON LIKE A PODCASS EARLY ON AND TO ME THERE'E THESE THREE LINES A KIND OF ALL GO TOGETHER WHEN IDS ARE ANYONE'S UPSADIN ASS KIND OF LIKE YOU START AND TOME I'S I  BEAUTIFUL IN VITATION TO HAVE THAT CON VERSATION JUST TO SAY TO SOME ONE I'M SO GUID YOU'RE TALKING TO ME ABOUT THIS RIGHT AND THEN KIND OF I BELIEVE YOU TELL ME MORE AND MY HUSBAND THAT  MENT Y HEARD IT WAS LIKE NOW YOU COULD LIKE SAYEL THOSE WORDS TO ME SOMETIMES I WOULD LIKE THAT BECAUSE AND I THINK ABOUT THE WORK PLACE TOO LIKE YOU HAVE SOMEOE COME IN THERE UPSET ABOUT I DON'T KNOW I GOT STAFF DONE THIS SIR I'M NOT GETTING A PROMOTION AND I I THOUGHT I WAS LIKE JUST DIFFUSE IT WHICH IS I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE TALKING TO M ABOUT THIS SEE I BEEN WORKING NON STOP FOR AND JUST IF YOU SAY TO THEMIC I I BELIEVE YOU CAUSE WE USUALLY DON'T SAY TO SOME ONE I DON'T BELIEVE YOU UWHAT WILL SAY AS WE WE DEFEND OURSELVES IN THAT MOMENT AND THE WAY THE OTHER PERSON RECEIVES IT IS AS IF WERE SAYING I DON'T BELIEVE THE INTENSITY OF THE EXPERIENCE YARE HAVIN AND WHEN YOU DO LEAD WITH I BELIEVE YEL SAMETHING IN A PARTNERSHIP YOU KNOW LIKE EVERYTINE MI ASK YOU TO DO SOMETHING YOU GET REALLY HOT AND BOTHER LIKE AND DOESN'T EVEN MEAN YOU  GREE O KIND OF DISBELIEVING I LIKE I BUTLYE I BELIEVE YOU LIKE TELL ME MORE RAY I BELIEVE YOU THAT THAT REALLY UPSET YOU AND LIKE A MOBISTY  THE WHOL ANOTHER TARYING MY HEAD BUT I I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND AND I KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING THERE AND I BELIEVE IT ENOUGH TO LIKE BE OPEN TO HEARING MORE ABOUT IT OH I'S LIKE WHAT'S BEST THAT'S WHAT UTS WHAT WE ALL WANT I AND OUT PARTNERSHIPS AND I'M WIDE I DMAN WHAT A BEAUTIFUL ACKNOWLEDGMEN THAT AS YOU POINTED OUT IS NOT AGREEING TO ACCEPT SOMEONE ELSE'S REALITY TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DISMANTLE THUT THE YOU KNOW THE ORDER OF THE WORLD AS ONT HAVE HEARD  BUT IT'S SUCH AN OPENING AS UPPOSE TO A CLOSING AND AS YOU SAID IT'S NON DEFENDED BUT IT'S ALSO BOUNDARIED ING THERE'S JUST SO MANY THINGS ABOUT IT THAT FEEL GOOD UM SEEM GOOD AND AND CLEARLY ARE GOOD NO I DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN THAT THE UM TRAGIC RABIT WHOLE OF TRAMA BUT UM PREVIOUS GESTOMIS PODCAST UM YOU KNW IS DEFIND WE TRIED TO FIND TRAMA JUST BECAUSE IT GETS THROWN AROUND A LOT TRAMA AN EVENT TOARE SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES UM THAT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED THE WAY THAT THE BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM WORK SO THAT THERE'S A MALADAPTIV RESPONSE GOING FORWARD IT'S NOT EVERY BAD THING THAT HAPPENS BUT THERE ARE MICROTRAMAS SOMETIMES CALLED SMALTY YUMOR MACROTRAAS A BIGT AGAIN COUL BE MULTI EVENT OR SINGLE EVENT BUT YEARS AGO A DIFFERENT PSYCHOLOGA PSYCHAATRIS IS AN ADOLESCENT IM PSYCHATROS AT STAMFORD SAID SOMETHING IN A SEMINAR THAT JUST REALLY STRUCK ME WHICH WAS THAT AT AT IT'S CORE TRAMA IS REALLY ABOUT CONFUSION OVER WHOSE RESPONSIBLE UM AND AND YOU WERE NOCIOUS TALKING BOUT THAT THE MORE SALIENT EXAMPLES OF LIKE SEXUAL SAULT THAT THOSE TWO US OF COURSE BUT YOU KNOW LIKE IF IF WE GET SCRIN NOT UM OR WE OBSERVE SOMETHING LIKE THIRD PERSON TRAM LIKE THE THE LOGICAL STANCES WOL A THAT WAS THEM NOT ME BUT WHEN THIS HAPPENS ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE YOUNG THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THE BRAIN SOME SOMEHOW INTERPRETS THIS SAS LIKE I WAS THERE I HAD A ROLL IN IT JUST BY BEING THERE SO LIKE WHAT WAS MY ROLL AND SOMEHOW THE EMOTIONAL RESPONSE BECOMES ONE OF RESPONSIBILITY EVEN IF YOU KNOW LIE THERE CLEARLY THE ONE THAT INITIATED THIS AND SO UM THE REASON BRINGING THIS UP IN THIS CONTACT IS THAT IT'S ALMOST LIKE THAT LACK OF BELIEF IN SELF SOMEHOW GETS ROODED IN AND THEN IT ALL FEELS CONFUSING AND THE WE DON'T FEEL SAFE THAT'S RE BECAUSE IT'S A CONFUSION ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY AGAIN GOING BACK TO THIS UM WE GO DOWN THAT RABITA R AES WHO  WIYS DOD II THINK THAT THE WHAN YOURE I WO NIN MATRAMA IS ACTULLY NOT EVENTS IT'S THE WAY AN EVENT GETS PROCESS AND NIT I LOVE GOBORMATE'S DEFINITION OF PROMA IT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU ITS WHAT HAPPENS INSIDE OF YOU RIGHT SO TO ME THERE'S AN IN HERENT RELATIONALITY THERE WHERE EVENTS THAT GET PROSI NOT AN EVENT EVENTS WITH HIGH EMOTIONALITY LET'S SAY THAT GET PROCESS IN ALONENESS BECOME DRAMATIC AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE IT GETS LINK TO RESPONSIBILITY SO THIS IS ACT TO IT MY TEDTOLK WAS ABOUT ND WHY REPAIRS SO IMPORTANT UM WHO SAID THIS RONALD FAIR BURN YEARS AGO THAT FOR KIDS IT IS BETTER TO BE A SINNER IN A WORLD RULED BY GOD THEN TO LIVE IN A WORLD RULED BY THE DEVIL I THINK IT EXPLAINS ALMOST EVERYTHING MY CHILD DFILDMENT WRIGHT THERE GOING BACK TO GOODNESS ALSO YOURE PARENT JUST CREAMED AT YOU AND BY THE WAY YOU'RE PARENT I SCREAM IT MY KIDS IVE ONE CON SCRIAM THEIR IDS IS CAN A HAPPEN AY THAT'S JUST THE EVENT THE EVENTS NOT CAN HAVE THE IMPACT WHAT IS HAPPENING FOR A KID WELL WE KNOW KIDS ARE ORANTED BY ATTACHMENT THEY LITERALLY NEED US TO SURVIVE LIKE THEY COULD ANOT SURVIVE ON THEIR OWN AND SO WHAT O YOU DO WHEN THE PERSON YOU'R DEPENDENT ON FOR SAFETY BECOMES THE SOURCE OF DANGER AND THREAT THAT'S VERY CONFUSING FOR A CHILD IN THAT MOMENT SO THERE SUPERHIPER AROUSED THEYRE IN THE STATE OF YOU KNOW TERROR AND THEN USUALLY AFTER IN MY HOUSE TO I TOS YELL OP MY KID THEY'RE KIND OF ALONE IN THEIR ROOM I'M ALONE IN THE KITCHEN OR WHEREVER MEANWHILE SPINNINGS MI CON SUCH A BAD PARENT LIKE I'M PROT YOU KNOW BUT MEANWHILE BECAUSE I'M SO LOST IN MY OWN GUILT I MIGHT NOT BE GOING TO MY KID AND SO WHAT HAPPENS FOR MY KID IF I DON'T REPAIR AFTER I SCREAM AT THEM ORE ONE OF THESE EVENTS RAY WELL A KID CANNOT SAY TO THEMSELVES MY PARENT JUST HAD A THAT DAY THEN THE BADNESS IS IN MY PARENT MY LEADER I'M SOME YOUNG NOW RIGHT LIKE I DON'T UNDERSTAND NU ONT'S MY LEADER CAN'T BE BAD SO I MUST TAKE ON THE BADNESS AT LEAST THEN I HAVE CONTROL SO KIDS AFTER THEY'RE KIND OF YELLE THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF REPAIR THEY THEY REALLY ONLY IF TWO OPTIONS FOR HOTA REGULARY AND FEEL SAFE AGAIN THEY CAN SELF BLAME IT'S ALL MY FAULT WHICH IS WHY FILLICK MOST ADULTS WHEN THEY AVE A HARD TIME THEY TELL THEMSELVES LIKE IT'S MY FAUL I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH IT'S LIKE THE LEGACY OF THAT STORY FROM CHILDHOOD OR THEY USE SELF DOUBT MAYBE THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN MAYBE I OVER REACTED MAYBE I CAN'T TRUST MYSELF AGAIN IT LEADS TO A DULTS WHO BASICALLY SAY LIKE DID I AE REACTOR I MAY CALL FIVE FRIENDS LET ME SEE IF THEY THINK WHAT MY BOYFRIEND DID WAS A BIG DEAL CAUSE THEY CAN'T TRUST THEMSELVES AND SO TREM TROMA HAT I WANT EVERY PARENT TO KNOW SE'LS I I LEFT MY KIT ALONE AN I DIDN'T PICK THEM UP AT THE SOCRAFIELD AS I CON TA TROMATIZE THEM NTELL SHEY WHAT THATS JUST THE EVENT LIKE DID YOU SAY TO THEM HE THAT PROBABLY FELT SCARY WHAT WAS THAT LIKE OH YOU'RE RIGHT LIKE YOU WERE ALON NOW OF A SIDDEN NEXT TO THE EVENT THAT WAS SCARY IS MY STORY AND MY CANN CTION IT GOT PROCESS IN A SAFE CONNECTION IT DIDN'T GET PROCESS IN A LONENESS AND THAT'S THAT'S A MASSIVE MASSIVE DIFFERENCE THE SNARIA YOUARE DESCRIBING THE PARENT WHO YELLED GOES TO THE CHILD  SHAVING BEEN THAT CHILD UM E PRESS ALSO HAVNG BEEN THAT PARENT RA HOW DO WE DO WITH THE FACT THAT SOMETIMES YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT TO BE AROUND THE PERSON THAT YELDED US IT HURT IT HURTS TO RECEIVE THE CARE THER THERES IT THERE'S A EE'S A LIKE A TEXTURED LANDSCAPE AS A O OA SMOOT LANDS KIP THERE LIKE LIKE O KAY NOW YOU'RE READY FOR EVERYTHING TO BE PEACEFUL I'M STILL WITH MY FEELINGS I GUESS THAT'S WHERE THE I BELIEVE YOU COMES IN AND THAT'S WHERE THE SORTING IT THROUGH PROCESS BEGENS SO I THINK IT'S LIKE WHAT VERSION OF A PARENT COMES BACK TO ME THEM THE FIRSTHING IVE TO DO IN A REPAIR PROCESS IS ACTUALLY REPAIR WITH OURSELVES IS A PARENT REALLY BECAUSE IF YOU HAVEN'T REPAIRED WIH YOURSELF WHICH TO ME IS KIND OF SEPARATING YOU'RE IDENTITY AGAIN FROM YOUR BEHAVIOUR LIKE A PAY BECKY ILL HEA'SE MYSELF AN EXAMPLE I'M A GOOD PARENT WHO JUST SCREAMD AT HER SON LIKE I DO NOMIS UP FOREVER AND YOU SEE WHEN YOU TRY TO REPARED YOURSELF THOSE TWO THINGS GET COLLAPSED I MEST HIM UP FOR EVER I'M A MONSTER WEIGT LIKE I'M A GOOD PARENT WHO DID SOMETHING I'M NOT PROUD OF YOU CAN'T REPAIR WITH SOME ONE UNTIL YOU'VE REPARED WITH YOURSELF THEY FEEL IT FROM YOU THEY ACTUALLY IT USUALLY IS LIKE THEN YOU'RE ASKING FOR THEM I'LL BE LIKE IT'S O KAY RIY LIKE YOU FORGIVE ME RIGHT IT'S NOT A REPAIR THAT'S LIKE USING YOUR CHILD TO TRY TO DO SOMETHING WE JUST HAVE TO DO ON OUR OWN OR WITH OT THEIR REDULTS BUT IF I'VE REPAIRED WITH MYSELF I'M GOING TO SHOW UP IN A DIFFERENT WAY  MIGHT I HAVE A FICTY KID I MIGHT I DON'T CARE IT'S NOT BETTER THAT'S O KIY I'M NOT REPARING TO GET SOMETHING FOR MY CHILD AND REPARING TO GIVE IN EXPERIENCE TO THEM SO WE CAN ALSO GET CREATIVE YOU KNOW YOUR KID IS OLDER YOU TAX THEM YOU SIP A DOOR UNDER THE NO YOU SAY OKAY I JUST HAVE TO SAY THIS ONE THING TO ME THE LINE REALLY MATTERS TILL IKE SNATCH THAT SELF BLAME OUT OF A KID'S BODY IS TO IKE I'M SORRY I YELLED IT IS SNEVER YOUR FAULT WHEN I YEL ND IT'S NOT AND PEOPLE WHO ARGUE LIKE OUR ABILITY TO REGULATE OUR EMOTIONS REDATED OUR CHILD'S EXISTENCE LIKE THAT YOU KNOW LIKE THEY HADN'T THEY HAD  SOMETHING THEY DID SOMETHING AND WE FELT FRUSTRATED BUT THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT THIN YELLING RIGHT AND SAYING THAT TO YOUR KID IS SO IMPORTANT MEANWHILE THE NEXT DAY YOU MIGHT SAY BY THE WAY LET'S REALLY FIGURE OUT HAD I GET OUT THE DOOR IN A SMOOTHER WAY YOU KNOW YOU COULD WORK ON WHATEVER THEY NEED TO WORK ON BUT THE REASON I THINK MOST KIDS AND A PROJECTING PARENTS APOLOGIES IS IT'S NOT REALLY REPAIR WE'RE ASKING OUR KID FOR PERMISSION TO BE OKE AGAIN FORA REPAIR SOUNDS LIKE HEY I'M SORRY I YELLED BUT YOU KNOW LIKE IF YOU JUST GOT READY IN TIME HAT ONE'T A HAFINDER WE SAY I'M SORRY YOU FELT THAT WAY I'M SORRY YOU FELT THAT WAY THOSE ARE NOT LIKE NONE OF THOSE ARE ACTUALLYE REPAIRS AND IF THAT'S WHAT A KID'S BEEN USED TO THEY'RE GOING TO KEEP A PARENT MORE A BAY SO'S IT SAFE TO SA Y THAT WE CAN ALWAYS COME BACK TO MAKING THE KID FEEL REAL AND SAF I BELIEVE YOU IS A GREAT PLACE TO START AND THE REASON I KEEP COMING BACK TO THE THE SIMPLE THINGS IS THAT SIMPLE BUT VERY VERY POTENT BY THE WAY UM IS THAT IN THE REAL WORLD LANDSCAPE APPARENTING FAMILY IN LIFE THINGS ARE HAPPENING REALLY FAST AND IT'S VERY DYNAMIC AND IT'S MULTI FASCENED AND MEY WE HAVEN'T YOUVEN TALKED YET ABOUT HOW WHEN THERE'S TWO PARENTS LIKE THE ONE THAT DIDN'T YELL UM WHEN THERE'S MULTIBLE SIBLINGS WHEN A M THERE'S THE HUMAN DYNAMICS ON AT ONE IN AND AOTHER OTHER LANDSCAPE IS IS HARD ENOUGH AND THEN WE START INTRODUCING THE REAL WORLD LANDSCAPE UM THINGS HAPPEN FAST SO HAVING SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE CAN REACH TO REALLY QUICKLY WHAT I CALL IN THE LANDSCAPE OF STRESS MODULATION WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT A'M MORE FAMILIAR WITH FROM MY LAB'S WORK IS IN A REAL TIME TOOLS YE REAL TIME TOOLS IKE WE'RE ALL AT OUR BEST AFTER MEDITATION VACATION MASSAGE AND A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP BUT WHAT ABOUT REAL TIME TOOLS WHEN EVERYTHINGS

WITH UM RETORTS AND RUDENESS AND AGAIN LET'S I'M EXTEND THIS TO ALL RELATIONSHIP SO YOU GET IN YOUR BEST MIND SAID AN BY THE WAY ALOF THIS I AM THING UM TWO OF THE MOST IMPORTANT WORDSAN ANY LANGUAGE UM WHEN TRANSLATE TH OTHER LANGUAGES I AM BLANK I AM A GOOD THISS OR AM WHATEVER ROLE IDENTITY IS KEY TO THE BRAIN UM WE KNOW THIS UM YOU GO IN AND YOU SAY I'M REALLY SORRY I STRUGGLE TO REGULATE MY EMOTIONS I BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE REALLY UPSET AND THE KID SAYS I HATE YOU NOW EARLIER YOU SAID THAT GOOD BOUNDARIES ARE ABOUT NOT EXPECTING A CHANGE IN BEHAVIOR FROM SOMEONE ELSE TERE ABOUT OUR OWN BOUNDARIES SO UM OR MAYBE THE I HATE YOU COMES FROM YOU KNOW LISTEN WHAT WE'RE NOT GEN AGO TO SONSAS HOUSE FOR PLAYDAT TODAY GREAT I AIN'T YOU YET I HATE YOU YUM SO IS THERE EVER A CASE FOR NO RESPONSE I MEAN TO ME THE MOST UNDER UTILIZED PARENTING STRATEGY IS DOING NOTHING LITERALLY IT'S ONE OF MY MOST YOU STRATEGIES CAUSE AND THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S HA REALLY GOOD REASON FOR ESPECIALLY IN THE SITUATION SO I ALWA 'S TO ME LIKE I WOULD SAVE IF TO UNDERSTAND BEFORE WE INTERVENE SO I KNOW EVERY PARENT IK WHAT YOU DO IN THAT SITUATION BUT IT'S LIKE TRYING LIKE IT'S LIKE TRYING TO FIX SOME ONE'S TENNISWING BEFORE YOU LIKE LOOK AT THEIR TENNIS WING RIGHT LIKE WHAT THE'RE BE A LOT OF PROBLEMS SO AND WHY IS A KID SAYING I HATE YOU AND I WOULD ASK EVERY PARENT TO JUST KEEP THIS IN MIND IT'S A TOOL AND YOU CAN'T USE IT IN REAL TIME AVENTUALLY YOU CAN BUT WE'VE TO SAY IT OUT LIKE THE END OF A NIGHT WHEN MY KID SAID I HATE YOU WHAT IS MY MOST GENEROUS INTERPRETATION OF WHY HE WOULD SAY THAT TO ME AND IF YOU'RE LIKE ANY HUMAN ME INCLUDED BY THE WAY LIKE YOUR LEAST GENEROUS INTERPRETATION IS IMMEDIATE YOU'R IKE BECAUSE HE'S A SOCIAEBAT LIKE THAT'S WHAT WE SAY ALL THE TI'ME LIKE WELL ARE BECAUSE HE'S LIKE A HORRIBLE KID BECAUSE HE'S SPOILED CAUSE HE'S NASTY IT COMES EASILY SO THAT'S FINE BUT WHAT IS MY MOST GENEROUS INTERPRETATION AND WHEN I DON'T KNOW I'LL PUSH MYSELF TO SAY O KAY WELL LIKE I WAS IN A SITUATION WITH MY HUSBAND WHAT WOULD LEAD ME TO SAY AND WHAT WOULD LEAD YOU TO SAY THAT'S SOME ONE THAT I HA THE I LIKE THEY LIKE SAY SOMETING YOU LIKE HEY ANDREW OR NOT AN I BE A BUT A YOU KNOWT DO THIS DINNER IT WOULD HAVE TO BE SOME SORT OF DEEP BETRAYAL OF TRUST AND AND WHAT I AND I HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IF I SAID THAT TO SOMEBODY THAT I REALLY CARE ABOUT HER LOVE IT AS I'M SAYING I HATE YOU WHAT I'M REALLY SAYING IS I LOVE YOU SO MUCH IN THAT HURTS UNBELIEVABLY ISUCH AN UNBELIEVABLE INTENSITY THAT WHAT'S COMING OUT OF MY MATH AS I HATE YOU BECAUSE OF YOU BECAUSE WE DIDN'T LOVE THEM THAT'S RIGHT  WOULD HAVE KNOW EFFACT I WAN YE A MET IT'LD BE IT'LD BE I'D BE MAD BUT INSTEAD IT'S OH IT HURTS SE WE SOMEHOW THERE'S AN EARL CERTAIN IN THER IT IS YOU KNOW I WHATEVER IN SERTA IT'S HATE YOU THAT'S RIGHT BYT WE REALLY SAYING IS I LOVE YOU SO MUCH ATD AT'S A CONSEQUENCE THAT THING YOU DID OR SAID HURTS SO MUCH THAT'S RIGHT AND SO I THINK THAT'S LIKE EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON FOR A KID OR LIKE TO ME MY MOST GENEROUS INTERPRETATION A SIMPLE WAY IS MYKE KID WHEN I SAID WE COULDN'T GO TO THIS FRIEND'S HOUSE THAT HE THOUGHT WE WRE GOING TO HIS FRIEND HE'S GIN TO SLEEP OVER HED LIKE SO BUILTED UP IN HIS MIND HED LIKE PROBABLY LIKE KIDS DO LIKE THEY HAVE THIS WHOLE IMAGE OWIN THERE R TO THIS AND THIS AND LIKE THE LET DOWN WAS SO INTENSE AN AGAIN I GO BACK TO KIDS HAVE ALL THE FEELINGS WE HAVE AND THEY'RE BORN WITH NONE OF THE SKILLS SO IT TAKES A LOT IF IT TAKES LIKE A PRETTY WELL DEVELOPED SKILL TO BE REALLY DISAPPOINTED BY THE WAY AND SURPRISED RIGHT IN A MOMENT AND LIKE MANAGE IT IN LIKE A MATURE WAY I'M SURE WE BOTH KNO ADULTS WHO AREN'T EALLY CAPLE OF DOING THAT RIGS O THEF FIC CON MY SEVEN YEAR OLD IS DOING THAT SO IF I THINK ABOUT IT THAT WAY WE LATCH ON TO OUR KIDS WORDS AS IF THEY'RE THE TRUTH THEY'RE NOT THE TRUTH IT'S NOT TO SAY THEY DON'T MATTER BUT THEY'RE NOT THE TRUTH THE TRUTH IS WHATEVER WORLD IS UNDER THE WORDS LIKE I'M DISAPPOINTED AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO MANAGE THAT SO IF I THINK ABOUT THE OUTCOME LIKE WHAT WUWDO I WANT TO BE WHAT I WOULD LOVE IN THAT SIT UATION CAUSE THE TRUTH IS WHEN I SAY TO MY KID SORRY WE CAN'T GO TO BOBBY'S HOUSE I WOUNDN'T EVEN WANT IS NOT NORMAL FOR MY KID T B OH NO PROBLEM BECAUSE I I WOULD I'M JUST PICTURE Y TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD LIKE TRYING TO GET A JOB AND BEING LIKE MOM OH I DIDN'T GET IT AND THEN HE'S LIKE NO PROBLEM I' LIKE THAT'S KIND OF WEIR LIKE REALLY LIKE THAT'S WERD LIKE I'D WANT YOU TO BE DISAPPOINTED AND SO WHAT I WANT MY KID TO BIABLE TO DO IS TO BE LIKE AND NOW WHAT'S THE BEST TO GETS LIKE ALL A MAN I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT'S LIKE ULTIMATE MATURITY SO HOW DO I GET FROM MI HATE YOU TO ALL MAN I WAS REALLY LIKE YOU KNOW LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT THEALL THE TINGS WE WANT TO DO JUST LIKE DON'T EVEN MAKE SENSE LIKE SETDING MY KID TO THEIR ROOM SAYING LIKE YOU'RE SUCH A NASTY KID IVE NEVER SEEN ANY OF YOUR FRIENDS SAY THACK TO THEIR PARENTS AND I'M GO TO ACTING THINGS THINGS OUT ITH OF COURSE I SAY THESE THINGS TOO BUT ALL I'M DOING IS BASILY TELLING MY KID THE VERSION OF THEMSELVES I DON'T WANT THEM TO BE SO NOW I'M FURTHER AWAY FROM THAT OUTCOME JUST NOT EFFECTIVE MY KID OVOUSLY LITERALLY NEEDS TO LEARN SOME OF THOSE KILLS AND PRACTISE THEM WE DON'T THINK ABOUT SIMULATIONS WITH KIDS NEARLY ENOUGH WE KNOW THAT IN SPORTS PEOPLE PRACTICE ALL THE TIME WE DON'T DO THAT WITH EMOTION REGULATION SO WHAT DO I DO IN THE MOMENT I THINK THE BEST QUESTION HERE IS WHAT DO I DO OUTSIDE THE MOMENT TO HELP I CID BUILD THE SKILLS SO THEY ACTUALLY HAVE MORE OF A SKILL THE NEXT TIME THAT MOMENT COMES STILL I'M A PRAGMENIS WHAT I DO IN THE MOMENT I HATE YOU I PROBABLY WOULD DO NOTHING FIRST WHEN SOME ONE IS RUDE TO YOU D THEY SAY SOMETHING NASTY I DON'T I JS LIKE THIS IS ONE THIS IS MY SON MISS IS MAD MY SON JUST HURLED I HATE YOU IT'S LIKE SITTING BETWEEN US WHEN WE SAY BACK TO THEM LIKE YOU KNOW I HATE YOU ER LIKE GO TO YOUR ROOM WE TAKE ALL THE ENERGY FROM WHAT THEY SAID AND WE JUST LIKE THROW IT AND THEN LIKE WE HAVE THIS PING PI MET WHEN YOU DO NOTHING I WAYS PICTURE IF THIS IS LIKE THAT HATE YOU IT JUST SITS BETWEEN US MY KID HAS A MUCH HIGHER CHANCE OF KIND OF RE OWNING WHAT THEY JUST SAID BECAUSE I'M JUST KIND OF STURDY IN THAT MOMENT BECAUSE I DIDN'T JUST TAKE IT FROM THEM AND SAY SOMETHING TO THEM WHICH JUST GIVES THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO LIKE TAKE WHAT I SAID AND HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FIRST THING THEY SAID IT'S ALWAYS TRUEIN ADULTS WHEN SOMEONE SAYS TO YOU LIKE SOMETHING NASTY IF YOU ACTUALLY JUST STAY THERE THEY'RE SHOOT IGISON V SAID THAT BECAUSE I IT'S IT'S RIGHT THERE SO I PROBABLY SAY NOTHING NOW A COUPLE I DON'T IF I'D REALLY DO THAT BUT I'D WANT TO DO THAT LON MOU BE CLEAR SOMETHING ELSE YOU CAN SAY IN THAT MOMENT WHICH TAKES A LOT OF PRESENTS SO IT'S NOT CAN HAPPEN RIGHT AWAY IS JUST SOMETHING I WO LIKE CLEARLY YOU'RE DISAPPOINTED I GET THAT I BELIEVE YOU AND I KNOW THERE'S ANOTHER WAY YOU CAN SAY THAT TO ME THAT'S ACTUALLY RIGHT BACK TO FAMILY JOBS I'M VALIDATING AND I'M SETTING KIND OF A BOUNDARY IN SOME WAYS LIKE I KNOW MAYBE THERE'S ALL HOPE THEY'RE TOO LIKE I KNOW THERE'S ANOTHER WAY F MY KID KEEPS SAING I HATE YOU I HATE YOU YOU THE WORST TO THE WORSE THEM MIT THI LISTEN I LOVE YOU YOU'RE A GOOD KID YOU'RE HAVING A HARD TIME I I REALLY WON'T STAY IN YOUR ROOM WHILE YOU KEEP SAYING THIS ME AN PART OF THAT IS CAUSE NOT CON FOR YOU EITHER LIKE THIS ISN'T A GOOD DYNAMIC OMINOUS STEP OUTSIDE I'MM NOT COME BACK AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT WHEN WE'RE BOTH IN A PLACE WHERE WE CAN BE ALONE OUR SPECKFUL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT RIGHT NON'T TO BE A PUNCHING BAG BUT AT LEAST NOW I'M HELPING MY CAN SEE THAT HE IS HAVING A FEELING UNDER THESE WORDS IF I CAN'T DIFFERENTIATE THE FEELING FROM THE BEHAVIOUR HOW CAN I EXPECT MY KID TO EVER LEARN TO DIFFERENTIATE THOSE TAIL WHICH IS HOW MY KID CAN ACTUALLY GET TO A MORE REGULATED PLACE I'VE SOMETIMES WONDERED WHETHER OR NOT PARENTS ARE EITHER AFRAID OF OR NOT AFRAID ENOUGH OF THEIR KIDS A II'VE KNOWN SOME PARENTS THAT ARE AFRAID OF THEIR KIDS BECAUSE T AND PERHAPS AS A CONSEQUENCE WHO KNOWS WHAT THE CHICKEN EGG A IS THERE ONLY KNOWITS THE PARENT WAS A LIVE FIRST THE KIDS LEARN TO CONTROL THEIR PARENTS THROUGH NOTNECESSARILY EMOTIONAL OUTBURST BUT THE THREAT OF EMOTIONAL OUTBURST I'VE SEEN TUS AGAIN AND AGAIN AND IT'S IT'S A PRETTY WILD THING TO OBSERVE A AND OF COURSE AS AN OBSERVER IT'S FAR EASIER THAN WHEN YOU'RE IN IT BUT THIS IDEA LIKE O LIKE THER LIKE A POPRATER BOIL OVER A A YOU KNOW LIKE THEI'R GOING A POP  AND I'VE SEEN THIS IN TEACHERS IN THE CLASS ROOM I'VE SEEN THIS IN SO MANY VENUES WHERE WHETHER NOT THE CHILD UNDERSTANDS THAT THEY'RE SOMEHOW CONTROLLING THE SITUATION OR NOT THAT THERE'S JUST AN INHERENT FEAR OF WHAT COULD HAPPEN AND THEN I THINK KIDS FEEL A CERTAIN POWER BUT THEY DON'T FEEL SAFE RIGHT I MAN HOW COULD THEY  THEIR CHILDREN YES A SO FOR THE PARENTS OUT THERE THAT ARE AFRAID OF THEIR KIDS POTENTIAL RESPONSIS AND OR HOW BAD THEIR KID QUOT IN UOP MIGHT TURN OUT IF THEY WERE TO REALLY LAY DOWN THE LAW YOU'R AMUSING AN OLD SCHOOLYOU C I IS IT GRR UPIN O YUA FORTY EIGT YEARS OLD SO AND YOU KNOW I YOU HAVING MY PARENTS YOU KNOW DIDN'T PHYSICALLY ABUS AT BUT THERE MIGTHAVE BEEN A SPANK AND EVER ONCE IN A WHILE AND I I DONT NO WHAT THE RULE IS NOWADAYS OR THE FOR THE THE A STANDARD OUT THERE YOU KNOW I THINK I WON'T SAY WHICH Y MIGHTHAVE TAKEN A SMACK HERE OR THERE BUT NOT MANY A AN IT THERE WAS ALSO A LOT O LOVE A BUT CLEARLY AM AND HEAR I'M NOT AM NUT SUPPORTING THE USE OF CORPORAL PUNISHMENT I WON M BE VERY CLEAR AM BUT YOU KNOW YO KIDS CAN BE TOUGH AND THEN ALSO YOU KNOW IT WASN'T LONGING TO MY HIGH SCOIERS WHEN I WAS PHYSICALLY LARGER THAN BOTH MY PARENTS I NEVER USE THAT TO INTIMIDATE THEM BUT I HAVE TO IMAGINE WHEN YOUR KID IS LARGER THAN YOUIF YOU WERE ALREADY PSYCHOLOGICALLY AFRAID OF THEM NOW YOU IT'S CLEAR TO BOTH OF YOU THAT THE A THE TABLES AF TURNT THAT'S RIGHT RIGHT O'M TIING ABOUT THAT THE  UNCONSCIOUS SEME CONSCIOUS ASPECTS OF THIS I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT WHO CAN YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY PHYSICAL FIGHTS THERE'S NOT SOMETHING I EVER WANT A SEEER DISPLATE HOUSEHLD SO THIS THIS IS AN AMAZING TOPIC LIKE WALKING ON EGGSHELLS MISSUS RAY AND THIS IS TERRIFYING TO A KID BECAUSE AGAIN IF A KID IS TRAN A FIGURE OUT LIKE AM I REAL AND AM I SAFE KIDS DO EXPERIENCE FEELINGS IN SUCH AN INTENSE WAY BE CAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY THOSE SKILLS ANDTHEY'RE SO SURPRISING N THEYRE SO VICERAL THAT IT IS SCARRY TO THEM AND THERE ARE KIND OF ESPECIALLYTHSE GROUPS OF KIDS THIK AL THEM DEEPLY FEELING KIDS THAT DO FEEL THINGS MORE INTENSELY AND THEY DO HAVE MORE OF THESE TBIG MASSIVE TANTRUMS EVEN LOOK ANIMALLISTIC OFTEN DURING THEY TRY TO SCRATCH YOU THEY'LL HISS STIRRING THEM THEY'LL GROWIS REAL YES THERE'S A I GROPES OF BIDERS YAT KIDS IT BY YES THAT'S BECAUSE AGAIN THOSE ARE JUST FEELINGS LITERALLY UN CONTAIND THAT ARE EXPLODING OUT WHERE DO THEY EXPLODE OUT THEUGE YOUR EXTREMITIES SO THEY THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT IS AND SO WHAT WILL HAPPEN AND THIS IS THE REALLY UNFORTUNATE DANCE ON ONE OF TH MY FAVOR THINGS TO HELP PEOPLE TURN AROUND IS THEN KIDS KIND OF SENSE FROM A PARENT I REALLY AM AS TOKSIC AS I WORRIED I WAS RAY AND AN'T WE GO BACK TO THAT PILOT THING LIKE I THINK ABOUT A PILOT OF SIKE I'M WE'VE TON MAKE AN EMERGENCY LANDING WE'RE NOT GONG TO BE ABLE TO GO TO ELLIE AND WE'RE ALL GIN A LAND AND CLEVELAND WHATEVER IT IS I PICTURE ARE THE PASSENGER WHO LIKE YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE US TO ALLA AND THE PILIC OH K HOW C CAN YOU IMAGIN YOU'RE LIKE IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT THIS PERSON IS PISSED LIKE YOU'RE THE PILOT YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP US HAPPY PLEASE KEEP US SAFE AND IF YOU'REIN THAT PLAIN IN YOU'RE TERRIFIED BECAUSE O OERE TO MAKE AN EMERGENCY LANDING I PROMISE YOU YOU'RE WAY MORE TERRIFIED WHEN YOU HERE THIS PERSON CHANGE THE DECISION BECAUSE OF THE THRET THAT A PASSENGER IS GOING TO BE VERY VERY UPSET AND THAT IS ACTUALLY WHAT WE DO WHEN WE'RE WAKING AROUND ON EGG SHELLS NOW THE ALTERNATIVE TO THIS AGAIN WE LIVE IN THIS WORLD IN PARENTING WHERE THERE'S A BINERY WHERE WE SAY AND YOU SET YOURSELFS TO WHIMIN LAID ON THE LAW LIKE I DON'T RECOMMEND THAT EITHER LIKE ESPECIALYWITH A KID LIKE THAT THAT'S NOK IN O BE THE BEST SOLUTION THESE KIDS HAVE TO BE SEEN AS GOOD KIDS THEY ARE GOOD KIDS AND WHEN I WAIT MEET WITH PARENTS OF THESE KIDS I HEAR ABOUT THEM AND LIKE I ALWAYS SAY I HEAR ABOUT THEM AND I'VE A KID LIKE THIS SO I GET ANIM LIKE I REALLY LIKE YOUR KID NEY'RE LIKE WHAT I LHINK I DO AND THEY'RE LIKE AND THEN THEY USUALLY START CRYING AND THO YOU'R LITERALLY THE FIRST PERSON AN ELEVEN YEARS WHOS EVER SAID THAT INCLUDING LIKE THE PARENTS I YOU LIKE OUR KID WHY I MAKE THEY'RE TENACIOUS THERE THEY KNOW WHAT THEY WANT THEY SEEM LIKE THEY ZERO PERCENT PEOPLE PLEASING IN THEM THESE KIDS WILL CHANGE THE WORLD BUT NOT IF THEY'RE BOUNDARYLESS THEN THEYLL BECOME TYRENTS AND THAT'S THAT'S REALLY TERRIFYING AND I'M N TO TEACH YOU HOW TO BE THE STURDY LEADER WHICH IS E COOLLY FIRM AS IT IS WARM AND THAT'S GONTO START TO DAY AND SO LIKE HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF THESE DEEPLY FEELING KIDS I THINK YOU SAI S INVELIC WATCHINGLY A TEV SHOW WHERE THESE KIDS ITF FEELS LIKE THEY HOLD THE FAMILY EMOTIONLY HOSTAGE RIGHT AND BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T PICK THE FAM THE MOVY THAT THEY WANT AO WATCH AND FAIILY MOVING NIGHT THEY WILL SCREAM THEY WILL CRY AND THEY WILL DO THAT FOR THREE HOURS THEY WILL OTHER KIDS AFTER YO'RE LIKE THEIR THEY DON'T PETER OUT THESE KIDS THESE KIDS INTERESTINGL ENOUGH GETTIN AN AWFUL CYCLE WITH THEIR PARENTS BECAUSE THEY HAVE SUCH INTENSE EMOTIONS MORE OFTEN WHICH MORE ESCALATIONS WHICH TEND TO GET MET WITH INVALIDATION YOU'RE SO DRAMATIC YOUE RUIN EVERYTHING THEY ARE THAT MUCH MORE DESPERATE TO BE BELIEVED THEY ESCALATE FURTHER YOU CAN UNDERSTAND HOW THAT WOILL BE TO MORE DISTANCE AND INVALIDATION AND WERE OFF TO THE RACES IN A BAD DIRECTION AND I'LD SAY THE PRENCE YOU'RE AN DURN FAMILY MOVING NIGHT TO MORROW NIGHT THIS IS WHAT YOUREGOING TO DO AND YOU'RE IN A BY THE WAY I WOULD SAY THIS IS HOW CONCRETE I YOU'RE IN A RIGHT THIS DOWN AND YO'RE GIN TO SAY INT TO A VOICE RECORDER WITH YOU'RE OWN VOICE AND I WANT YOU TO PLAY A BACK AND SEE HOW STURDY YOU SOUND THE'LL OFTEN DO IT THE'LBYLIG WOLL I DIDN'T EVEN BELIEVE MYSELF WHEN I SAID THAT I'M SO SCARED OF MY CHILD RIGHT YOU'RE N DO IT AGAIN THEN YOU GAN DO IT AGAIN AND THIS IS THIS IST JUST LIKE ANY OTHER SKILLWY PRACTICE AND YOU'RE GIN TO SAY TOYOU'RE KID LOOK I KNOW IN THIS FAMILY YOU NOW BOBBY USUALLY WE LET HIM PICK THE MOVE HE GETSUALLY UPSET IF NOT WE ALL TO NIGHT'S GAN TO BE DIFFERENT BOBBY IT IS YOUR SISTER'S TERM TO PICK THE MOVY AND I KNOW YOURE GOIN TO BE UPSET AND I'S WONE TIME EXACTLY WHAT'S CAN HAPPEN AN OMINOUS IN THIS EXAMPLE O'N SAYN THERE'S A TWO FAMILY HOUSEHOLD WHICH IS AN ASSUMPTION BUT EVEN IF THERE'S ONE IF YOU'RE SUPER UPSET AND SCREEMENT I'M GOING TO BRING YOU TO YOUR ROOM THIS IS IMPORTANT I'M GIN TO SIT WITH YOU I'M AN STAY THERE AND THIS IS A LINE THAT I KNOW IF FOM OUR DEEPLY FAILING KID WORKSHOP HAS REALLYIN YOUHVE TO BELIEVE IT TO SAY IT I AM NOT SCARED OF YOUR FEELINGS AND I KNOW PARENSILL SAY TO ME MAKE YET YOU'RE IN A FAKIT TO YOU MAKE IT THEY THEY NEED TO HEAR THAT BECAUSE IF Y THINK ABOUT THE IMAGE OF THESE KIDS THEYRE FEELINGS FEELL SO OVERPOWERING TO THEM THEY FEEL MORE BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY MORE CORRUS TO THE WORLD SO THEY BOTH HAVE MORE COMING IN DTHEY ARE ACTUALLY ALWAYS TERRIFIED OF HOW MUCH OF THEM CAN FLOW OUT AND SO THEY FEEL TEIR FEELINGS THAT WAY IT'S ALMOST LIKE MY TANTRUM IN THE HOUSE TAKES UP THE ENTIRE LIVING ROOM THAT'S WHY YIC YURE TO BRING THEM TO A SMALLER ROOM AND YOU ACTUALY HAVE TO CONTAIN THEM IN THAT WAY AS A WAY IF KIND OF SAYING IT ONLY GOES THIS FAR LIKE LITERALLY I WILL NOT LET YOU DICTATE FAMILY MOVY AND ALWAYS SITTING IN THE FRONT SEE AND YOU'R FAVORITE CHAIR AT DINNER IT ONLY GOES THIS FAR AND THAT IS TRULY IN ACT OF LOVE AND PROTECTION AND SAFETY FOR THOSE KIDS HHOW OFTEN YOU OBSERVE TIT THESE D DEEPLY FEELING KIDS AS ANONTHER  YET IM DEN I MADE UP THE TERMS O BUT GREAT DEPLY FELING I A YOU'R YOURE COLIFI TO QUALIFIED TO SO DEEPLY FEELING KIDS UM ALSO EXPRESS THESE I DEEP FEELINGS IN THE POSITIVE SENSE IM I BECAUSE I CAN THINK OF SOME KIDS I GREW UP WITH AND I CAN LOOK AT MY OWN EXPERIENCE OF UM LIKE IT'S HARD TO KNOW WE DON'T HAVE A CALIBRATION POINT IS NOT LIKE BODY TEMPERATURE O LIKE HOW MUCH I FEEL VOR IS HOW MUCH YOU FEEL WE LOO THE AN EXTERNAL EXPRESSION OF THESE THINGS LIKE O THE THE LACKREMAL GLANCE SAT CREET SOME TEARS ARE NOT LIKE YOU NOT AS YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS THIS THING BEFORE I KNOWS I LIKE WELLED UP A LITTLE BIT AND OMTHING ELLIC I CAN REMEMBER SEING THINGS AND FEELING KISSEN LIKE WHALIT'S A REALLY BIG IN TATS I DON'T REMEMBER SCREAMIN AT MY PARENTS TELLING THEM I HATE THEM I PROBABLY DID AT SOME POINT BUT UM BUT I HAVE OBSERVED OTHER MOTHER KIDS PEERS THAT GREW UP THAT CLEARLY FELL INTO THIS CATEGORY AND HAVE GONE ON TO REMARKABLE THINGS YET REMARKABLE LIKE EXTRAORDINARY YAGS BECAUSE IT'S IT'S A CAPACITY IT THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS SKEW TOWARDS NEGATIVE EXPRESSION IT CAN ALSO LIKE IMMENSE ECXPRESSIONS OF LOVE AND AND NOW I THINK THESE SAYS THAT THERE'S A TENDENCY TO FOR UNQUALIFIED OR LIKE TRULY UNQUALIFIED PEOPLE A BECAUSE HEY'RE NOT TRAING TO DO SO TO SLAP LABELS LIKE BORDER LINE WRIT SPLITTING LIKE GOOD OBJECT THAT OBJECTS SPLITTING AN ANDY THAT'S THAT EXISTS IN TH AS AT IGNOISIST IN IN SYMPTOMS OF BORDERLINE BUT THAT UM WE PUNISH RATHER THAN I BELIEVE IN OBSERVE THAT THESE THINGS EXIST THIS RANGE AND NERVOUS SYSTEM TUNING AN AFFECT AND UM SO PUT SIMPLY IM DO DEEPLY FEELING KIDS ALSO TEND TO EXPRESS LOVE ENJOY AND UM AM POSITIVE EMOTIONS WITH IT WITH THE SAME INTENSITY OR NYOUR SAME INTENSITY O WIS THEY DEPENDS ON THEM LIKE IT DEPENDS ON AND AV KIND OF THEIR STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT AND THE NATURE OF THE INNERACTIONS THEY'VE KIND OF RECEIVED BACK I THINK DEEPLY FEELING KIDS I WAS THE ARE SUPERSENSORS LIKE A VIEW OF ON THESE KIDS AND I'VE ON THESE IDS WITH A AN EAR CITY SHE WILL NOT GO INTO NEAR CITY GORACH I LIKE WHERE WE PARK ARCAR AND SHE'S LIKE THE SMELL AND IM THE REST OF US LIKE WOULD YOU TALKING ABOUT MEANWHILE I'VE ANOTHER FRIEND WHO LIVES TO E VE AN AIRY OF MEN AT AND AND SHE IS A DEEPLY FELING CATCHES WHEN I JUS MY DAUGHTER THE SAME THING LIKE I ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT MY DAUGHTER SMELLS SOMETHING THAT I DON'T SMELL LIKE THEY ARE SUPERCENSURS IN THAT WAY RIGHT AND SHE NOTICES THE LITTLE DETAIL OF SOMETHING NOW IN TERMS OF THE INTENSE LOVE I THINK FOR THESE KIDS THEIR VUNERABILITY SITS SO CLOSE TO THEIR SHAME THIS IS WHY THEY GET SO EXPLOSIVE THEY ALMOST EXPERIENCE THEIR FEELINGS AS ATTACKERS WHICH IS AGAIN MY PARENTS CAN GET SCARE TOF THEM AND THEY DO BECAUSE AGAIN THEY FEEL THAT FEELING SO INTENSELY THAT THEY HAVE THE STEEP FEAR OF A BANDONED MAN AV BEEN TOO MUCH AND SO THEY THAT SHAME TRIES TO SHUT IT DOWN ALTHOUGH IT OBVOCY DOESN'T WORK IN AN EXPLODES WHAT I'VE NOTICE WITH DEEPLY FEELING KIDS AND THIS TO ME IS ACTUALLY LIKE TRULY MAYE PROUDEST BODY OF WARK AND U MENTION BORDER LINES SO I'LL GO THERE PEOPLE OFE SAID LIKE THESE SOUND ALMOST LIKE KIDS WHO ARE BUT HAVE SOME PREDILECTION TO TO BORDER LINE AND IVE U SEE HAVING GONE TO A PAGE DE PROGRAMME WERE TOLD A LOT ABOUT INVALIDATING AND FIRONMENS AND THINGS LIKE THAT I'M NOT REALLY ONE FOR LABELS EITHER BUT I JOS NOT SO MUCH INSIGHT FROM MY HONESTY MY OWN KID WHERE AS A GWOLIC SHE IS SO DIFFERENT AND HOW CHE PROCESSES THINGS AND WHAT SHE NEEDS AND HOW SHE RESPONDS TO MY VERY SAME INTERACTIONS AS MY OTHER KIDS LIKE THEIR VERY DIFFERENT AND NOT FEAR OF ABANDONMENT AND BEING TOO MUCH IT WAS LIKE IT WAS LIKE THEY'RE FROM THE STARRYI REALLY FEELS LIK IT WAS LIKE THEYRE WHAT'S SO INTERESTING AS I FEEL LIKE THEROUGH WORKING WITH HER BY THE WAY IN A VERY DIFFERENT WIFE AT THESE KIDS REJECT ALMOST EVERY TYPICAL PARENTING STRATEGY YOU GO TO VALIDATE THESE KIDS FEELINGS IT'S LIKE YOUR TRYING TO INTRUED ON THEM IN STEAL ER HEART BECAUSE IF YOU THNK ABOUT THEIR POROSNESS THEY'RE SO TERRIFIED OF BEING TAKEN OVER ITHAT WHEN YOU'RE LIKE SEEING A FEELING THEY FEELIK YOUR LIKE SEEME INTO THEM AND SO THEY REJECT YOU I WIS SAY CANPO IN THE FRONT DOOR WITH THESE KIDS YOU'VE GOT A LIKE FIND THESE SIDE DOOR APPROACHES BUT NOW OF ALL MY KIDS SHE IS BY FAR THE CODILIEST THE MOST LOVING THE MOST EMPHATIC ABOUT OUR RELATSHIP UP THIS TRIP NOT OMAN AMISS YOU SO MUCH LIKE THE IDEA WHICH YHE WIS FORD THAT ANY OF THAT I WOULD SAY TO SOME ONE LIKE YOU ARE CRAZY YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT A DIFFERENT KIDS SO I THINK THAT YES THAT DEEP LOVE IS THERE AND IT WE JUST HAVE TO KIND OF MAKE IT A LITTLE SAFER FOR THOSE KIDS TO ACCESS T IS THERE ANY AND GENERAL STATEMENTS THAT ONE CAN STILL MAKE ACCURATELY ABOUT DIFFERENCES IN THE EXPRESSION WERE PERHAPS EVEN THE EXPERIENCE OF DEEPLY FEELING KIDS IN BOYSFIRSEST CIRRELS GREAT QUESTION UM I ACTUALLY HAVEN'T NOTICED A TINE BU THERE MIGHT BE I' LOVE TO LOOK MORE INTO THAT BUT IN TERMS OF ONE OF THE ACCURATE I HAVEN'T NOTICE THAT YET I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS YOU KNOW YOU HAVE ONE OF THESE KIDS IS IF YOU KNOW THE MOMENTS WHEN YOU'RE APPARENT WE ARE KID LIKE NEEDS YOU LIKE THE'RE AND IN THOSE MOMENTS YOURE KIDS PUSH YOU AWAY THEY PUSH YOU AWAY WHEN THEY NEED YOU THE MOST IF THAT'S LIKE I THINK I'D REALLY COMMON QUALITY FOR THE FOR THOSE KIDS OW O UNCOMMON IS EM I SUDDENLY SUCH A LIKE A IBY'LL JUST THIS THAT DEEPLY FEELING KID A FENO TIID I I DON'T W I DON'T WANT IT YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT IT IM LESSEN THE IMPORTANCE OF  OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BY NAT SAYING IT THAT WAY BECAUSE I ASHALLY WHAT I THINK YOUR TING IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT RESINATES WITH ME ON A LOT O DIFFERENT LEVELS IN FACT SO I BUT BUT AS FAR AS I KNOW IT'S NOT A DESAM DIKNOSE IS NOT AND THANK GOODNESS IT'S NOT I Y I WOULD PATHOLOGEI THAT IS RIHT RIGHT YEOM SO BUT YOU KNOW OF THAT YOU KNOWIN IN A CLASSROOM FOOT LET'S AN IK AN A BIG CLASS FROM A HUNDRED K IDS YE  HOW MANY THOSE KIDS PR AND I'M GUESSING IT' A CONTINUUL BUT WOULD FALL INTO THIS CATEGORY OF DEEPLY FEELING I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT ITS A CONTINUON AND CONNECTING TOPICS I KNOW YOUS SPOKEN ABOUT I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF LOOKING INTO THIS OVERLAP WITH DEEPLY FEELING KIDS AND YOUR DIVERGENCE AND EIGHTY H D AND WHAT I THINKS INTERESTING ABOUT THAT IS WE WE HAVE THESE WORKSHOPS SES KEEPLY FEELING CAN WORKSHOPS AND ALLOW THAN WE DO LIVE THERE'S THIS WHOLE CHAP  AND I'LL SAY THESE THINGS YEU LIKE THAT YOU NOW N THEY'RE DEFFLIN IDEAS HE HAVEN'T HEARD BUT WHAT I THINK IT'S MORE HEELING IS THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN THE CHAP AND SAYING I I THOUGHT WHEN I SAY THE HISSING THING THE CHAT IS LIKE A WATERFAL I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE I THOUGHT SO IKE THERE ARE SO MANY OF THESE KIDS WHY I THINK THERE'S MORE AND MORE OR SOMETHING I NEED TO LOOK MORE INTO BUT I THINK IT DOES LIFE YOU THINK ABOUT THESE KIDS AS MORE CORUS AND YOU THINK ABOUT HOW INSANELY STIMULATING THE WORLD IS THAT WE BRING UP KIDS WHAT COMES INTO THEM IT WOULD MAKE SENSE THAT I THINK THIS IS LIKE A GROWING TYPE I'M GUESSING IT'S SIMILAR WITH EIGHTY H T TOO IARE SO MANY MORE KIDS DIAGNAS THAN THE PAST THE WORLD WE BRING UP KIDS IN THE CENSORY OVERLOAD IF YOU'RE HOW OF THOT MUCH MORE POROUS THAT'S GOING TO OVERLOAD YOUR SYSTEM AND YOU KNOW IT'S  AND I THINK THAT I THINK THAT'S ALLSO WHY MORE IN MORE KIDS ARE SO WHAT'S THE PERCENTAGE I DON'T I DON'T KNOW LIKE A MAYBE TWENTY THAT THAT T DON'T ELL SAN EARLY HIGH PRECIDEA I THINK IT'S A FAIRLY HAIERCENAGE THAT FEELS RIGHT T THIT JUS SOR FEELS RIGHT BASTE ON MY OBSERVATION OF ADULTS ALSO YE UM FEELS RIGHT MIGHT ALSO EXPLAIN A LOT OF THE M APPARENT CONFLICTS AND AND UM MISUNDERSTANDINGS AND A DUN'T RELATIONSHIPS THAT'S EX AND WE I MEAN SO MANY PEOPLE I E'LL SAY ME I WAS ON MY GOODNES LIKE THAT WAS LIKE THAT WAS LIKE YEARS IF THERPE FOR ME WATCHING HAT I THOUGHT I WOULD TOOKE THAT FOR MY KID LIKE THIS WAS ME AND I FINALLY TALK MA I BELIEVE YOU THAT'S O MIN DEEPLY FEELING KIDS ARE DASPRIT TO BE BELIEVED AND THEY'RE DESPERATE FOR OUR TEMPTS TO CONNECT WITH THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE DEEP FEAR IS THERE UNLOVABILITY AND SO THEY DO REJECT TYPICAL ANU OWIT'S THE STAMPS GET OUT OF MY ROOM FINE YOU'RE SO DIFFICULT AND THEN SEE I REALLY AM AS UNLOVABLE AND THAT AS I WORRIED I WAS  UNLESS WE CAN OF REVERSE THAT CYCLE I BE WILLING TOBOUT MY LIFE THAT MOST OF THE ULTRA SUCCESSFUL PERFORMING ARTISTS THAT WE OBSERVE UM YH'R NOTIN  NAMES BUT JUST THINK OF ULTRA SUCCESSFUL THA THE PEOPLE WHOSE WORDS MUSIC POETRY WRITING ACTING A PRESENTS IVOKES IMMENSE   EMOTION IN OTHER PEOPLE SO MUCH THAT PEOPLE WILL PAY MONEY TO SEE THESE PEOPLE EXPRESS THEIR EMOTIONS AND ON'S INSIDE THEM FALL INTO THE STEEPLY FEELING CAT OF RHUNTRIPPERS IM JUST CAN'T BE ANY OTHER WAY  YET THAT THE MUTED A PERFORMER UNLESS THAT'S THE THE STICK SO TO SPEAK IS UM IS JUST NOT COMPELLING YE YE AND I'M I LOVE E WERE TALKING TO DAYS ABOUT I'M THE KIND OF I'M TUNING FORK NATURE OF EMOTIONS A SA I WHAT WHAT A TRICKY BALANCE SPEAKING OF THAT I'D LIKE TO JUST RETURN O SOME THN I RAISED EARLIER AND THEN I MADE THE MISTAKE IT WAS MY FATHER OF SHUTTING THE HATCH ON IT AND LIKE TO REOPEN THAT HATCH WHICH IS IM WHEN THERE'S TWO PARENTS MAYBE THERE UNDER THE SAME ROOF MAYBE THERE NOT AFOR THIS IS A TO CARETAKERS IM SO KIDS ARE PRETTY DARN GOOD AT FIGURING OUT WHO TO GO TO FOR WHAT AND HOW TO BOWANCE OUT NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES BY SEEKING OUT THE POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT OF THE OTHER SOMETIMES EVEN PITTING PARENTS AND CARETAKERS AGAINST ONE ANOTHER I MEAN MAKES CHILDREN SOME DIABOLICAL BUT ADULTS DO IT TO IT'S CALLED GOSSIP WHAT CAN CO PARENTS CO CARETAKERS IM DO TO TRYIN A LINE STRATAGEESE OR IF NECESSARY TO OFFSET I'M SOMEWIKE BAD STUFFD THAT THE OTHER PARENT MY BE DOING IN IN TO DAY'S LANDSCAPE WERE IT'S ABOUT FIFTY PER CENT OF OF MARRIAGES AND A DIVORCEDLY SEIN YOU ASK YOU'LL HAVE THE THE SITUATION WERE THEN T THER IMSE NEW SIGNIFICANT OTHERS COME IN AND NOW YOU'VE EXTENDED THE LANDSCAPE TO YOU KNOW SOMETIMES FIVE OR SIX DIFFERENT PARENTS  YOU KNOW M MY FAMILIES MY BI LOGE OF MAL MY SAYING TO LOOK LIKE THE YOU EN WE GOT SO MANY COUNTRIES AN RELIGIONS AN  SAYING IT'S KUN ANICE ON THE ONE HAND BUT IM LOTS OF DIVERGENCE OF OPINION AND EMOTIONAL STANDS AND BACKGROUND SO HOW IN THE WORLD DO E DO WE WRAP OUR EFFORTS AROUND THIS YE SO  I ONE OF THE MOST COMMON QUESTIONS I GET FROM A PARENT AT GOOD INSIDE IS LICAN YOU CONVINCE MY PARTNER WHY THE WAY THEY DO THINGS IS WRONG AND YOU KNOW TO THINGS MORE I LIKE GOOD INSIDE AND SO IS TENT YI ATWAYS SAYI GAM NOT FIRMILI MES THEN I'M NOT LIKE TO INTERESTIN TAKING O MA BUT I DON'T ET IN VULGIN CUP OF TI AN AN THAT I YOU KDON'T BUT BUT AGAIN ASSUMING IN YOU SAI THIS A COUBLE TIMES WHICH I LOVE LIKE I'M ASSUMING THE WAY OR A KIND OF PARTNER OR YOUT CO PARENT DOES THINGS IS NOT LIKE REALLY LIKE DAMAGING YOUR CHILD OVOUSLY NOTS LIKE YUR REALLY TIME FOR AN INPEREVENT YO HITTING NO EMOTIONAL ABUSE EXACTRLY BUT YOU KNOW EVEN TKE I'M NOT A BELIEVER OF SAYING FOR A TIME OU I LIKE I DON'T BELIEVE IN TIME OUTS AND PUNISHMENTS I I DON'T THNK THEY FEEL TOT TO KIDS OR PARENTS AND I ALL SO TO THINK THEY'RE EFFECTIVE NOT ONLY TE TIME OUTS NOT EFFECTIVE I DON'T THINK SO AND I AM WE VI SHOULD CLOSE THE HATCH ON I HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT THE GOING A WORD IN THE PROFESSION OF PSYCHOLOGY AND RAISING KITS PROPERLY IS YOU NEVER SPANK OM YOU NEVER HITM YENFOR THE RECORD SOW MAYBE ILL GET BACK THERE BUT JUST TO GO ON THE RACKER AND I THINK YOU CON SENTS FROM MY STYLE NOT PUNISHING OR TIME OUTS THI DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE PERMISSIVE AT ALL THEREIS ZRO PERSENT PERMISSIVE OR EVEN SOFTNESS I THINK YOU KNOWAND WIT THER SOFTNESSTHERE ZERO PRESENT PERMISIVE IN THOSE MOLMENTS BUT WE N GET BACK THERE BUT LET'S AY YOUR PARTNER DOES DO THAT OR THE COPARENT RIHT I I WOULD BE THE FIRST TO SAY TO SOME ONE LIKE DO I THINK T THAT'S I MESSING UP YOUR KID I I DON'T I REALLY DON'T ESPECIALLY IF FOR EXAMPLE N THAT SITUATION LET'S SAY UM I'M DIVORCE AND MY NOW ACTS YOU KOW I JUST KNOW THA THEY DO TIME OUTS OR THIS AND I'VE TRIED TO TALK TO THEM BUT YOU KNOW WHATEVER THEY'RE NOT GETTING ON BOARD WITH THI STYLE AND TO ME WHAT HAPPENS IS LIKE YOU HAVE A KID THEY COME BACK TO YOU ND I YOU KNOW UM PAPA GAVE ME A TIME NOW AND WE DON'T DO THAT IN MY HOUSE AND MY FIRST THING IT'S I CALL MY ACTS AT'S USULY WHAT I DO OR THE SCHOOL TO THIS AN I CALLS  I CALL THE ACTS IN MY WHY DID YOU DO THAT WE DON'T DO THAT WHAT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANCE AND I ACT YOU FIND IT VERY LIKE RELIEVING TO AS APPARENT WAT'S ACTUALLY MOST IMPORTANT IS HELPING MY KID UNDERSTAND THEIR EXPERIENCE LIKE WE CENTERE THE OTHER PERSON AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING WRONG WRONG INSTEAD OF CENTERING OR KID WE MIGHT NEED TO CALL APPARENT THE OTHERPPARENT AND SAY LIKE HEY  BE REALLY GREAT TO GET ON THE SAME PAGE COULD WED WE DO THIS COURSE TOGETHER O JUST BE GREAT YOU DON'T TO AGREE WITH ANYTHING I THINK THAT WOULD BE GREAT BUT IN THAT MOMENT WHAT MY KID NEEDS ACTUALLY IS LIKE WAIT THAT'S KIND OF HARD CONFUSINGS LIKE IN OUR HOUSE WHEN YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE YOU SCREAM I HATE YOU YOU KNOW I INTERVENE IN ONE WAY AND WHEN YOU GO TO YOUR DAD'S HOUSE THE INTERVENES IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAYS A LOT OF LIKE IT'S A LOT OF SWITCHING TO MAKE SENSE OF YOU KNOW OR MAYBE MY KID SAYS AM MA'M NEVER APOLOGIZES TO ME AFTER SHE YELLS I WOULD CALL YOU KNOW OR MAYBE IT'S MY OWN WIFE AND O MYE HEY NO THE IMPORTANCE UFFER PAIR HAVEN'T YOU LISTEN TO OH THIS LITERATURE YOU KNOW I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME INFLUENCE ON THAT BUT WHAT I FEEL IKE MY KID NEEDS IN THE MOMENT IS HNE I TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED OH OH SHE YELLED AT YOU AND YOAV LA COMING I KNOW LIKE I KNOW MAMWAS I KNOW SHEAD A  TRUSTLE DAY AT WORK AND LOOK THIS ISN'T YOUR RESPONSIBILITY BUT YOU CAN JUST KNOW THIS MAM HAS A REALLY HER TIME APOLOGIZING HER HAS A REALLY HER TIME APOLOGIZING AND ACTUALLY WHEN PEOPLE HARD TIME APOLOGIZING THEY SEEM COLD AND LIKE THEY DON'T CARE I ACTUALLY USUALLY FEEL SO ASHAMED OF WHAT THEY DID AND THE REASON I'M TELLING YOU THAT IS NOT BECAUSE YOU'VE TO TAKE CARE OF HER BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW THE SO WASN'T YOU AND ANY TIME SOMETHING HAPPENS WITH MAM THAT DOESN'T FEEL GOOD AND YOU THINK YOU CAN'T RESOLVE IT LIKE YOU CAN TALK TO ME AND IMN TO GET OUT OF ROLL PLAY FOR SEC BUT THEY CAN SEE I'M NOT THROWING MY WIFE UNDERTHE BUSS LIKE AAT ALL UM BUT I'M CENTERING WHAT MY KID NEEDS WHAT MY KID NEEDS GOING BACK AS THEY NEED TO PROCESS THAT EXPERIENCE WITH IN A DULL THEY FEEL SAFE WIT RATHER THAN BEIN ALONENESS AND I I OFTEN PICTURE LIKE THIS KID ON THE COUCH WHO TELLS ME A PROBLEM AT THEIR DAD'S HOUSE ARE AT SCHOOL AND I LIK GO OFF TO MAKE A CALL AND I PICTURE THEM ALONE BEING LIKE OH LIKE NOWM ALONE LIKE I WHERE'S IKI DIDN'T REALLY WANT YOU TO G DO THAT I WEN YOU TO LIKE TO LISTEN TO ME YOU KNOW UM THERE MIGHT THEN BE A STEP TO YOU KNOW T A KIND OF GET ON THE SAME PAGE OR WHEN PARENTS SAY GET ON THE SAME PAGE I THINK THE PROBLEM IS THERE WE'RE NOT LIKE LOOKING AT THE SAME PAGE FORGET GETTING ON THE SAME PAGE R NOT EVEN SPEAKING THE SAME LANGUAGE LY PEOPLE SAY TO ME MY PARTNER WON'T EVEN WATCH OF VIDIO WITH ME THAT I JUST WANTE EVEN EVEN IF THEY DISAGREE THAT IS THE PROBLEM AND FRANKLY THAT'S NOT A PARENTING PROBLEM THAT'S ALSO WHAT I'LL SAY TO SOME ONE IF YOU SAY TO YOUR PARTNER LOOK I'VE BEEN A MEMBER A CINSIDE AND AS BEEN REALLY HEPFUL AND IT RESINT ATS AND YOU NOVE DO AGREE WITH IT BUT LIKE I WOULD LOVE TO WATCH THIS FOUR MINUTE FO YOU IF YOUR PARTNER SAYS NO THAT IS NOTHING TO DO WITH PARENTING THAT IS A CORE RELATIONSHIP PROBLEM THAT THEY JUST DON'T HARE TO DO SOMETHING THAT YOU SAY IS IMPORTANT TO YOU THAT'S THAT'S A MARRIAGE PROBLEM THAT'S ALWE RIGHT SO AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND WE TALK OF THE SYLOLIC IF THAT WAS SOME ONE I'D COACH THEM TO SAY HEY AND YOU NOVE TO AGREE BUT IF YOU DON'T COME INTO WATCHING A FORMINAT VIDIO WITH ME AN JUST TALKING ABOUT A LITTLE ABET MI PROMISE I'LL TRY NOT TO BE JUDGY YOUR PROVY I'LL JUST LISTEN I REALLY THINK WE'RE TON MY PARNING I THINK YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU DON'T REALLY RESPECT ME ENOUGH TO DO THE THINGS I'M ASKING YOU TO DO AND THAT'LL THAT'LL STICK WITH ME K THAT THAT'S O AD HANDLE IT YES IS VERY HELPFUL I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THESE GTY H T DIGNOSY SLASH KIDS SALOTO YOU KNOW IM LOOSE ANDIAGNOSIS IS STAY THESE DAYS AM THE YEARS AGOS A CAM'T COUNTS LOR TO KIDS BACK PACKING IN A LEARND AN IMPORTANT CONCEPT OF AH WHEN WORKING WITH ADOLICE AND AND TEENISH BOYS WHICH IS BE A CHANNEL NOT A DAM YOU KNOW WHEN THER' SUPER ENERGETIC THEYRE NOT SITTIN STILL WEDS NOT NATIM YOU OW THERE'S JUST NO WAY AUM SO THIS NOTION OF GETTING IT OUT LIKE ALLOWING SOME PLACE FOR PHYSICAL OR EMOTIONAL CATHARSIS THAT SAF OBVIOUSLY AM AND THAT KID'S A A LOT OF ENERGY I MEAN DAM IT THE THE DULL POPULATIONS SEEMS TO BE TRYING TO PROGRESS THEMSELVES TO HAVE THAT ENERGY SO HOW CAN WE BLAME THEM FOR HAVING SO MUCH ENERGY AND A OF COURSE THER OUR CHILDREN HAVE ENADULTS WITH CLENICALLY DIAGNOSADIATIE THAT REALLY STRUGGLE BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE THE KID THAT'S MORE ENERGETIC A MAYBE EVEN HAS A HARD TIME SITTING STILL TO THE POINT OF DISCOMFORT AND WHEN THE REST OF THE WORLD THAT WE CAN'T CONTROL IS TELLING THEM WHAT HAY LIKE YOUR KID IS WHY TES TO BE REGULATED ON THE SUBWAY ON THE BUSS IN THE CLASS ROOM UM YOU KNOW WHAT ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE CAN DO IN TERMS OF COMMUNICATION WITH THOSE KIDS AND PROYOUE SOME OF THOSE KIDS ARE LISTENING AS WELL AMAND TO JUST BE A CHANNEL NOT A DAMN TO LOW THEIR BEST EXPRESSION TO COME FORWARD YE I MAYN I LOVE THIS IDEA IN GENERAL LIKE WE IT'S MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE TO TELL ANY ONE WHAT THEY CAN DO RATHER THAN TELLING THEM WHAT THEY CAN'T DO RIGHT ACROSS THE BOARD WITH KIDS BECAUSE THERE'S USUALLY A CAN THAT IS POSSIBLE AND THA N LIKE YOU KIN WORK WITH THE URGE INSTEAD OF HONON'T YOU KNOW WHAT TRYING TO SUPPRESS IT OR HAVE IT NOT ACT ITSELF OUT ITS SIKOUR URGES AND FEELINGS ARE FORCES LIKE THER CAN I COULDN'T COME OUT AND SO YES I THINK THIS IDEA LIKE ME AND MY KIT ARE ON THE SAME TEAM ERE I THINK THAT'S SO IMPORTANT TO START WITH AND YE GEN DEFFLYENOUG YOU VOCATE O SOME ATTENTIONAL YOU KNOW STRUGGLES IKE WE'RE ON THE SAME TEAMMET YOU CAN SO EASILY GET INTO ME AGAINST YOU AND THN YOU LOOK TO SHUT DOWN ANYTHING EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM BUT Y I WERE ON THE SAME TEAM SO IT SAY LIKE IT'S HARD TO DO HOMEWORK RIGHT NOW I SEE YOU OK THEY LET'S LET'S TAKEN A MOUNT OF TIME AND IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'VE A LOT OF ENERGY LIKE LET'S DO SOME HEAVY WORK OR LETS RUN OUTSIDE AND MAYBE HOMARK ALWAYS HAS TO START AFTER A PERIOD LIKE THAT MAY BE THEY NEED A BREAK BUT THIS IDEA OF YET OME WORKING WITH MY KID AS UPPOSED TO AGAINST MY KID IS ALWAYS CAN T BE MORE SUCCESSFUL DO YOU THINK THAT SOME OF THE NEW EMERGING TOOL SOME OF WHICH YOU KNOW I'VE TALKED TO LOT ABOUT BUT MANY MANY PEOPLE OF TALK TO L ABOUT UM THINGS LIKE MEDITATION KIDS DOING SOME LONG EXCALE BREATHING UM YOU KNOW IN ADDITION TO THAT YOU KNOW THE WAY I GIRIRL FILLS LIKE PETIME A RECESS TONG LIKE RUN AROUND LIKE CRAZY AN UM DO YOU THINK THAT THESE TOOLS ARE HELPING KIDS GETS SOME SELF REGULATION OR IS WHATEVER SELF REGULATION THEIR GAINING OFFSET BY THE FACT THAT OM YOU KNOW THE SHUST SO MUCH MORE IM PUT YOU KNOW WE HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT THE CHALLENGES OF SOCIAL MEDIA FOR ADULTS BUT CERTAINLY FOR KIDS UM YOU KNOW BULLYING OGSLY BEING ONE O THE MORE SALI ONE BUT ALSO JUST ABACT TOU WHEN THEY GO HOME AT NIGHT AND THEIRE IN BED THEIR PROTENTIALLY STILL IN INTROACTIONS WITH THEIR FRIENDS RESTAP I A PHONE LANDLINE THAT SOMETIMES CALL ONE ANOTHER ON BUT I WASN'T REALLY MUCH OF A PHONE KID H WITH MY FRIENDS SO YOUARE HOME YOUARE HOME YOU WERE SEPARATED FROM ALL THAT MEAN HOW BAD IS IT AND UM WHAT ARE SOMETHINGS IT PARRIN TAN KIDS MIGHT CONSIDER YET ME MEDITATION THINGS LIKE THAT LIKE ALWAYS LIKE ICING ON THE AKE THINK THAT'S ALWAYS HELPFUL AND CERTAINLY LKE TEACHING KIDS REAL TOOLS LIKE THOSE ARE LIKE LITERALLY SOMETHING I CAN DO I'VE LEARNED THIS MEDITATION I HAVE A MONTRESSN LIKE THAT LHEE HUGE FAN HANY HAVE TO BE ABLE LIKE TOUCHIN SOME WAY BUT TO ME I THINK WHAT WATS COMING UP AS YOU BRING UP THIS LARGER POINT AND IT AC SHE GOES BACK TO ERY STARTED IS THE COST TO CHILDREN OF PARENTS NOT BEING ABLE TO SET BOUNDARIES HAS NEVER BEEN HIGHER AND AND AT THE SAME TIME HAS NEVER BEEN HARDER FOR PARENTS TO SET BOUNDARIES AND I THINK THE STUFF STARTS AWAY BEFORE SO SHAL MEDIA LIKE TO ME HAN I THINK ABOUT THE EARLIEST YEARS OF A KID'S LIVE YOU GET SO MUCH BANG FOR YOUR BUCK IN LIFE FROM HELPING KIDS TOS LEARN TO TOLERATE FRUSTRATION AND SO MUCH OF KIDS EARLY LIFE RIGHT NOW IN THE WORLD TO BE LIVING IS ALL ABOUT THE IMMEDIATE ESCAPE FROM FRUSTRATION AND NOT ONLY ESCAPED FROM FRUSTRATION BUT FROM FRUSTRATION TO GRATIFICATION AND LIKE AN INSTANT SUC SO FAST HOW TO THAT JUS HAPPEN LIKE IT DIDN'T USE TO BE LIKE THAT THERE WASN'T EVEN AN OPTION LIKE ME AN YOU LIKE I NOW YOU WANTED O MOVY LIKE ON' KNO MAYBE YOUR PARENT COULD DRIVE YOU TO BLOCK BUSTER IF YOU HAD AN ACCOWN AND THEN LIKE MAYBE ANTHI I REMEMBER GOING B ARE THE CAN HAVE IT I THAKE CAN TO HAVE IT AND THEN YOU SEE THE THING THERE'S NOTHING BEHIND HIM DON'T HAVE IT THAT WHOLE O VENTER BY THE WAY WAS A VIDIO R JUST I JUST OA A TOLI GIN BUT'S AO THER LIKE I SOMETIMES DO THIS TO MYSIDE YOU KNOW YE ABSOLUTELY I USED TO LOVE GOING A PICK OUT MOVIES AT THAT THE VE VCES STORE WHOT DI YOU THINK ABOUT THAT IS ONE TINY THINGAS I MA SEE TINY ANDYTHING ABOUT LIKE I REMEMBER THAT MY CHILD HAD ANTHN BOUT THAT TINY MOMENT COMPARED TO SOME PARALLEL IN A KID THE THERE'S NO FRUSTRATION THE WANT AND THE GRATIFICATION THERE'S ZERO SPACE THERE IS ZERO SPACE AND AND ALSO I'VE TO SAY OUR GENERATION OF PARENTS AND ME TO ONE HONTEPERESENT ME TO OUR TOLERANCE FOR FRUSTRATION HAS GOT AWAY DOWN BECAUSE OF THE GRATIFICATION WORLD WE LIVE IND WHICH MEANS OUR TOLERANCE OF OUR KIDS HANTRAMS IS TAT A ALL TIME LOW BECAUSE WE'RE LIKE HAY MY LIFE IS LIKE PRETTY EASY IN A LOT OF WAYS THIS IS LIKE A MASS OF INCONVENIENCE SO KIDS HAVE MORE GRATIFICATION THAN EVER WE HAVE LOWER TOLERANCES FOR FRUSTRATION EVERY ONE DOES WHICH MEANS THE WAY WE INTERACT WITH KIDS OVER AND OVER AND OVER PLUSHES THE NATURAL THINGS THERE SURAT THEIR EXPOSED TO OR NOT LIKE NAPLIKTERS IS BLOCK LUSTER JUST MEANS LIKE THER CIRCUITRY AROUND EXPECTATIONS AND WHAT FEELS GOOD TIK TO ME THAT'S WHAT REALLY IT SCARES ME IT DOES AND LIKE FIGURING OUT HOW TO TOLERATE OR EVEN IN SERCH LIKE WE DO INSIR FRUSTRATION INTO YOUR KIDS LIFE AS ERLY AS POSSIBLE TO ME IS LIKE IS IS IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE I COULD NOT AGREE MORE AND AND I SAY THAT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT I HI'VE ALLSO SHORTEN THE LATENCY IN MY REWARD PREDICTIONERERS WHICH IS NERVED SPEAK FOR I WHEN I WANT WATCH HIM MOVA GOING TO TAT FLIX IN TAT LIKE IT'S NOR INFINITE AND I CAN GET RIGHT THEN UM THE INNER NETS ALOS SLOW THAN I START BARKING ABOUT U SLOW IN AN AS WORSE THAN KNOWING AN AT AND YOU NAW YOU START OBSERVING YOURSELF HE TOSGO I CANESS LIKE WHAT'S GOING ON YE ME THERE'S THE ABILITY TO TOLERATE DIFFERING WAIT TIMES BETWEEN ANTICIPATION REWARD IS SO CRITICAL THAT'S WAT GETTING IN DEGREE IS ABOUT THAT'S WHAT DOING ANYTHING CHALLENGING IS ABOUT UM I I'VE GOTE ON RECORD SAYING THAT UM TOO MUCH DOPAMEIN WITHOUT EFFORT EXERTED IN ORDER TO GET THAT DOPEMIN UM IS VERY DETRIMENTAL WELL THAT TO ME IN ALL THE SCREEN TIME KIND OF DISCUSSION THERE'S SO MUCH GREENTIME AND SO CIAL MEDIA AND LIKE ALL THE THINGS THAT SCREEN TIM EM DUE TO FOR KIDS AND AGAIN LIKE MY KIDS WATCHTEVY AND THEIR YOUNG THEY HAVE I'VE HAD LIKE I'M SO NOT AF PURIST A'M A PRAGMATIST AND WHEVERS LISTNING TO THIS NO ONE MESS UP THEIR KIDS FOR EVER RI SO WE CAN JUST LIKE WEAR TIME IT BEFORE USE THUS INFORMATION TO MAKE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DECISIONS ON THE MARGIN THAT'S T HE BEST A GETS BUT I THE ABOUT TIS LIKE WHNE OUR KITS OUR SPECIA YOUNG AND THEY'RE BUILDING THE CIRCUITRY AROUND LIKE WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO GET SUCCESS LIKE WHAT WHAT ARE MY EXPECTATIONS THERE HOW MUCH EFFORT DRI'VE TO PUT IN ND I THINK ABOUT LIKE IA YOUNG KID YOU KNOW PLAINGS O MINDLESS JUST DOPA MEAN GIVING GAIN THE CIRCUIT THEY LEARN IS LIKE MINDLESSNESS ZERO EFFORT DOPAME AND THEN I THINK AND I FIND THIS LY INTERESTING LIKE HOW MANY PEOPLE SAY LIKE THEIR KID IS SIX NOW HAVING A REALLY HARD TIME LEARNING HOW TO READ ANDY NALL THEY'S LEARNING ASESSIMENS AND LEARNING ASSESSMENTS ARE COMING BACK LIKE NO DISLIXIA I RIT AND I KNOW SOME ME TIMS HEY SAY S THAT LOVE IS ISING I LITERALLY THINK THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN THIS KID'S LIFE THAT THIK KIND OF HAVE TO PUT LIKE CONCERTED EFFORT WITH OUT IN THE MOMENT SUCCESS AND SO YOT THAT LIKE THAT LOOKS LIKE A LOT OF THINGS IT CAN ICAN EVEN PRESENT LIKE EIGTY H T RIGHT BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT CAN PRESENT LIKE THAT IT MIGHT BE BUT IT MIGHT ALLSO JUST BE THAT THESE DOPA MEAN CIRCUITS HAVE DEVELOPED IN A WAY THAT'S SO THAT'S NOT CONDUCIVE WITH SOMETHING LIKE LEARNING HOW TO READ RAY AND SO WHEN PARENTS ASKE ME NOW LIKE NOW READING IN DEMIC SKILLS LIKE WHAT CAN I DO WHEN MI THEIRE YOUNGER I GOT THEM FLASHCARD NO FLASH CARTS LIKE I'M YOUVENG ET LASHCARTS THAT'S FINES NOT LIKE DETRIMENTAL BUT TO ME IT'S LI WEL WHAT OES MY KIDS RELATIONSHIP WITH FRUSTRATION BECAUSE THY ABOUT THE TINK A LIKE THE LEARNING SPACE I GAN I VISUAL LIKE THERE'S NOT KNOWING HOW TO DO SOMETHING AND THEN THERE'S SUCCESSFULLY DOING SOMETHING AND THE SPACE IN BETWEEN THIS LIKE THE LEARNING SPACE THAT'S WHAT LEARNING IS AND LEARNING THE LEARNING SPACE INHERENTLY IS FRUSTRATING THAT'S LIKE THE RIGHT FEELING TO BE FEELING AND WHEN KIDS HAVE LEARNED TO COLLAPSE THOSE TWO THINGS THEN LIKE THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF SPACE TO LEARN VERSIS I DON'T KNOW EVEN LIKE OMETHING ABOUT MY KID I WANTS TIL LIKE DRAW A RAINBOW OR SUN WHEN THEY'RE YOUNG AND  LIKE THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A SUN IT WOULD BE EASY FOR ME TO BE LIKE LETME JIS DO THAT FOR YOU AND BY THE WAY YES I GIVE MYSELF PERMISSION TO DO THAT SOMETIMES LIKE SOMETHIMES LIKE I CAN'T DO WIT THIS LI'VE GOT OTHER THINGS TO DO BUT SOMETIMES I THINK LIKE LONG IN THAT LONG TURM GREEDY LIKE THIS SIS CAN TO BE THE SAME CIRCUIT FOR LEARNING HOW TO READ IT IS ENFER LEARNING OW TO DO THAT PROJECT AND WHAT IF MY ONLY GOAL FORGET THEM DRAWING A SUN AND I'VE GOT AO TOLERATE THE WINING MY ONLY GOAL WAS JUST TO LENGTHEN THE AMOUNT OF TIME THEY LET THEMSELVES BE IN THAT LEARNING SPACE THAT'S IT BECAUSE I THINK WE KNOW IS ADULTS IT'S NOT ABOUT GETTING TO SUCCESS THAT COMES WHEN IT COMES THE LONGER AMOUNT OF TIME YOU LET YOURSELF BE IN THAT LEARNING SPACE THE MORE SUCCESSFUL YOU CAN BE WITH HARD THINGS SAS LIKE IT JUST AS WHERE YOU'S GOT A TRAVERSE THRILL AND SO TO ME THAT'S LIKE HONESTLY ON THE THINGS THE MOST PASSION ABOUT TEACHING PARENTS IS LIKE LITERALLY LIKE WHAT YOU DO DURING THAT TIME THEN HOW DO I CHANGE WHAT MY GOAL AS IF MY GOALIS TOSNOT MAKE ITS TANTREM MAN A COLLAPSE IT BUT IF MY GOAL IS JUST TO LENGTHEN THAT I MIGHT DO SOTHING VERY DIFFERENT ALL DRAWING A SERT THAT'S NOT YOUR RIGHT YOU DIN WANT A DRAW THAT AWDRAWING A TIRCLE IS SO HARD MAKE IT CAN YOU DO IT FOR ME CAN YOU DO AT LIKE OF COURSE SOMETIMES I WILL BUT I MIGHT SAY LIK I NOT CAN I DO IT SWEETY I'M NOT YOU KNOW WHY BECAUSE I KNOW YOU CAN DO THIS A LITTLE MORE I FEETIN YOU AND I THINK THIS IS SO POWERFUL TO SAY BECAUSE THIS IS SO FRUSTRATING AND THAT'S THE EXACT WAY YOU SHOULD BE FEELING OU DON'T WANT AR CINS TO BE YOU THAT'S THE RIGHT FEELING I'LL EVEN DRW THAT LEARNING SPACE VISUAL THIS IS WHERE YOUARE IN O THIS IS WHERE YOU WARE YOUR DOING IN AMAZING JOB AND IT IS ACTUALY INTERESTING WHEN KIS OR YOUNG IKE THEY ACTUALLY DO A DOPT THAT LIKE SOME ONE SAID TO ME LIKE I'VE BEEN DOING SO FOR A WHILE MY CID LITERALLY SAYS TO ME I LIKE TO DO HARD THINGS MA'M BUT THIY THEY BELIEVE IT LIKE THAT'S AN AMAZING SELF BELIEF TO DEVELOP  METON THRI SO YES I THINK THE STUFF ESPECIALLY COMPARED TO HOW EASY IT IS TO GET THAT GRATIFICATION IS JUST IT'S LIKE MORE POINT THAN EVER TO HAVE AN OFFSET Y I'M A DOING MY BEST TO GET THE WORD OUT INTO THE WORLD THAT THE ONLY REASON THE BRAIN CHANGES AT ALL IS IF AM THERE IS THESE NER MODULATORS LIKE EPANEFERAND A DRENNALIN IN THE BODY IN BRAIN BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT SIGNALS THAT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM NEEDS TO CHANGE IF SOMETHING CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED THERE'S NO REASON FOR THE NERVOUS SYSTEM TO CHANGE BY DEFINITION THERE'S ALSO I DON WANT TO SPEN OFF INTO A AND I'M NO SCIENCE OF RESILIENCE IN WILL POWER LESSEN YOUR BU THERE'S SOME AMAZING LITERATURE THAT AM SHOWS THAT THERE'S THIS ARY OF THE BRAIN THAT ENTERMID SINGULAT QUARTAC WHICH AS ACTIVATED WHEN PEOPLE DO THINGS THEY DON'T WANT TO DO UM AND IT GENERALIZES TO OTHER THINGS BUT THIS IS NOT THAT I LOVE TO WORK OUT SI IN A WORK OUT THIS IS THE I HATE TO WORK OUT AND I DO IT ANYWAY AND IT TRANSLATES TO SUCCESS IN ACADEMIC ANDEVER IS SUCCESSOM ALL SORTS OF ENVIRONMENTS AND SO I THINK IM THE BEAUTY OF IT IS THAT THIS BRAIN STRUCTURE IS HIGHLY PLASTIC AND CAN BE BUILT UP THROUGH ONE THING IN THAT TRANSLATES TO OTHERS SO DOING HARD THINGS EXPERIENCING A WHAT I CALL LIMBIC FRICTION JUST AS AS A GATE WAY TO LEARNING  JUST UNDERSTANDING THAT IT IT ALWAYS FEELS HARD YET THAT'S WHAT LEARNING IS IN FACT I CAN REMEMBER IN GRADUATE SCHOOL EVEN AS A YOUNG ADULT I'MTWENTY AS I WAS STRUGGLING WITH AN ANALSIS AM AM MY GRADUATE ADVISER I SHE WAS WONDERFUL THIS WAY IN I AT SHE CLEARLY KNEW HOW TO DO IT AN I SAID AM CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW TO DO THIS AND SHE GOES NO NO OWAS I DISIT DONDANE IS LIKE NO IT'S CALLED LEARNING IY WALKED OUT SHE IS ALSO GREAT PARENT AM TO HER CHILDREN A MAN A'LL SO TRY TO GET ADOPTED BY HER AND THAT FAILED SO YOU KNOW THERE ARE TIME THAT CHAR'T EXACTLY MY POOR PARENTS LIKE ITHEY THEY DID THEIR BEST ANDI'M GRATEFUL TO THEM FOR MANY THINGS BUT I THINK THAT I'M INCLUDING THE THE ENCOURAGEMENT TO DO HARD THINGS DO THINGS IT SUC AM THAT ARE BENEFICIAL FOR US SINCE IT IT'S IT'S A NIFE ETGE RIG KNOW I'M REFLECTING IT'S LIKE DO THINGS IT SUCK I BELIEVE YOU IT SUC AND THEN WHAT WHAT O MY MOMES TO SAY A LOT YOU KNOW HATE ME NOW LOVE ME LATER NOW I LOVED HER THEN AN AND A LOVER NOW BUT YET THERE WERE MOMENT HEAS LIKE I THAT YOUR MAKING ME DO THIS AHM I N'T KNOW WHAT THE HATE ME NOW LOVE ME O SCHOOL AH BUT I THINK WHAT SHE WIS TRYING TO SAY IS I HAVE YOUR BEST INTEREST IN MIND DEFINITELY TET'S IT RIGHT DEFINITELY YE NO DEFINITELY AH CAN I SAY ONE THING TIS CONLOUT IN MY HEAD E LIKE ONE OF THE THINGS AND IS LIKE I THINK IT'S EASY AND I'M HEARING MYSELF LIKE WE HEAR THIS AND IT IT'S EASY TO LISTEN  LIKE O MAN I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT OF THAT WAY ERE I DODN'T KNOW THAT OR AGAIN WE DESPIRAL IS APPARENT SO FAST LIKE IM AS TO MAK IT FOR EVER LIKE NOBODY MUST UP THEIR CONFREVER IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW THAT IS IS NOT TRUE AND THIS IS WHT I THINK WE CONSPIRE A UNTIL LIKE YET WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME AND LIKE I KIND OF ASSPARENTS IN THE SITUATION TILL LIKE COME WITH ME TO A DIFFERENT LOCATION WHICH IS KIND OF LIKE ANGER AND IHAVE STARRED TO FEEL ANGRY AND I THINK ANGRY AND GIRLIKE TELLS US WHAT WE NEED SO LIKE WHAT IS THAT ANGER TELLING ME LIKE IT IS IT IS MESSED UP THE SYSTEM IST ACT AGAINST US THAT WHEN YOU BECOME APPARENT IT IS LITERALLY THE HARDEST MOST CONFUSING MOST RIGGERING MOST IMPORTANT JOB WE HAVE AND WE ARE GIVEN ZEARO RESOURCES REY LIKE NOBODY I KNOW WOULD TELL A SURGEON WHO NEVER WENT TO MED SCHOOL AND WAS STRUGGLING AT SURGERY THAT THEY WERE A BAD SURGEON THEY'D E LIKE O LIKE YOU PROBABLY LIKE YOU PROBABLY DESERVE TO GO TO MED SCHOOL AND RESIDENCY BY THE WAY LIKE THAT'S AN IMPORTANT JOB YOU HAVE AND SO I THINK ITS EASY TO LISTEN TO ALL THIS IN SPIRAL UNTIL LIKE OH NO BUT I'D ASK YOU ALMOST LIKE FEEL A LITTLE LIKE PROTECTIVE HELPFUL ANGER NEXTS TO IT WHICH IS I OH LIKE YES LIKE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT JB I HAVE THIS IS COMPLICATED AND MAYBE THEIR RESOURCES OUT THERE THAT LIKE I DESERVE AND I THINK THAT LIKE THAT'S THE PERSPECTIVE OUT ASKE PARENTS TOLLISEN FROM REALLYR YOU DESCRIBE THE JOB OF PARENTING AS BOUNDARIES I  IMPARTING BOUNDARIES AS WELL AS EMPATHY AND VALIDATION AS ON'T REMIND PEOPLE THAT YOUR BIT LIKE VERY BASIC BUT VERY PRACTICAL AH JOB DESCRIPTION FOR PARENTING IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE CAN RETURN TO OVER AND OVER AGAIN IT ALSO MAKES ME WONDER AH YOU THINKING ABOUT THE AM GENERALIZEABILITY OF THESE CONCEPTS TO OTHER FORMS OF RELATIONSHIP BOUT THE RELATIONSHIP TO SELF I I SOMETHING WE DON'T OFTEN TALK ABOUT YES A LATIONSHIP TO SELF WE WE WANT TO HAVE BOUNDARIES AND WE ALSO WANT TO BE ABLE TO EMPATHIZE AND VALIDATE OURSELVES YE AND I THINK GREATLY I DON'T KNOW MY FRIEND AND VITE ME AND I FOUND SHOUT SHE HAD FIVE FRIENDS FOR A DINNER AND HUSC AH YOU KNO'M SO HUR I WOULD I WOULD SAY TO ME THOUI I BELIEVE MYSELF LIKE I'M ALOUT TO FEEL THAT WAY I THINK OUR FEELINGS LOVE WHEN WE TELL THEM THEY MAKE SENSE I TO THINK THER SING MAGICAL ABOUT THAT PHRASE T MAKES SENE THEM UPSET I MEAN MY FRIENDS ARE ALL THERE AND I WASN'T THAT THAT MAKES SENSE AND AND THERE'S A BOUNDARY CAUSE WHEN MY FEELING TELLS ME I'M ABOUT TO PLAN A DINNER PARTY FOR TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE AND IF I EVERY ONE I KNOW BUT HER I FEELI THERE'S IMPORANT K YOU KNOW  FEELING LIKE A NOK A NOT TON LET YOU GO THAT FAR AND THE IMAGE I ALWAYS THINK ABOUT IS LIKE OM THE DRIVER OF MY CAR AND ALL THE DIFFERENT FEELINGS AND URGES LIKE THEIR PASSENGERS AND WE CAN'T GET THEM OUT OF THE CAR YOU JUST CAMP THEYRE IN YOUR BODY BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO LET THEM TAKE OVER THE DRIVER SEAT THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT IS AND AS LONG ASTHEYR PASSENGER THE EFEREE WON'T CAUSE YOU THAT MANY PROBLEMSTHEY'LL BE ANNOYING G AND TO ME THAT'S LIKE HEY I SEE YOU LIKE I SEE YOU AND I WILL OFTEN SAY HIGH ON MY FEELINGS FOR THAT REASON LIKE HIGH ANXIETY THAT WILKE ME UP BEFORE IN THE MORNING YOU KNOW LIKE YES THERE'S A LOT OF MY MIND HIGH AND THEN THEREIS LIKE A BOUNDARY LIKE YOU'RE NOT LIKE YOURE PART OF ME AND NOT ALL OF ME SO I THINK THAT PHRASE FOR REGULATING OUR OWN FEELINGS YOU'RE PART OF ME AND NOT ALL OF ME IS THE ESSENCE OF TVALIDATING AND HAVING A BOUNDARY WHAT ABOUT OUR NEED I THINK HEALTHY NEED TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THE LESSON STOCK NOT SO I'VE OBSERVE THIS BEFORE A KID IS CATASTROPHIZING ABOUT AND UP COMING EVENT MAY BE A CONCER TOR A TEST OR HOMEWARD THING OR A SOCIAL THING AND  GO YOU WOULD USIN ALL OUR BEST TOOLS TO TRY AND HELP THEM AND I BELIEVE YOU I HEAR YOU THAT AND I GO THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE AND THEY DO PRETTY WELL THEY'VE EVEN GREAT AND THEN WE SAY LIKE DID YOU NOTICE YOU WERE SO CONCERN BEFORE AND YOU DID IT YT REALLY DID IT IS THERE SOMETHING THAT WE CANNER SHOULD DOU TO TRY AND STAMP DOWN THAT THAT RECOGNITION BECAUSE ONE THING THAT SO BEAUTIFUL ABOUT CHILDHOOD IS THE UM SHORT TERM HORIZON NATURE OF CHILDHOOD WHICH HELIGNET TRYD NOT MWE TALK ABOUT YOU'LL ADULTS TRYING TO GET ONE DAY AT A TIME OR EVEN HALF A DAY AT IM A KIDS ARE NAVIGATING ON THE BASIS OF LIKE FIRST PERIED CLASS YE SECONDBURY CLASS AH THEY THEYRE THEIR HORIZN IS OFTEN VERY CLOSE IN AND I DO WONDER IF THEY'RE INTERNALIZING THESE THESE MORE GLOBAL LESSONS UM ON THEIR OWN OR WHETHER NOT WE SHOULD A TRYN HELP THEM INTERNALIZES WHAT THEY JUST DID LIKE DOYOU GET IT YOU WERE SUPERCONCERNED YOU WELLY ALMOST DISSOLVING ITO A PUDDLE OF YOUR OWN TEARS AND I BELIEVE YOU THAT WAS THE COMPRATE RESPONSE THEN AND NOW YOU DID IT LIKE THINK ABOUT THAT IS IT GOOD THAT WE REENFORCE THOS THOSE UM THOSE WINDS YE I MEAN I THINK THAT I THINK OUR KIDS DO INTERNALIZE CAN THE PATTERNS RIGHY BUT BUT I HEAR YOURE THERE TESE MOMENTS SO MOS LIKE WE WENTA LIKE NCAPSILATID FOR THAT MIKE HATE I WAS A THING RIGHT I THINK KID'S PICK UP AND WETHER AR INTER ACTIONS WERE DOING SOMETHNK FOR THEM OR FOR US SO IF IT'S FROM A LIKE HEY THAT THING I TALT YOU IS REALLY HELPFUL RIGHT LIKE IT WOULD JUST BE LIKE IF MY HUSBAND WAS LIKE HEY YOUR PESENTATIONMENT WELL BECAUSE I LIKE TOLD YOU TO DO THAT THING AND I'D BE LIKE STOP TALKING TO ME RIGHT BUT IF HE SAID TO ME HEYLIC WHAT WAS IT THAT LED TO THAT'S PRODY LIKE THAT'S HELPFUL TO TALK OUT YOU KNOW I'VE BE MUCH MORE OPEN SO I LOVE THE PHRASE GOING BACK TO LIKE JUST REAL TOOLS I'M NOTICING I THINK ACTUALLY OFTEN WE WANTO PRAISE OUR KIDS OR TELL SOMETHING JUST SAYING I'M NOTICYING AS AGAIN WE WANT TO BE SEEN WE DON'T WANT TO FEEL CONTROLLED I'M NOTICHING DOES THAT LIKE HEY I'M NOTICING YOU ARE SO WORRIED ABOUT THIS TEST WE KIND OF TALKED ABOUT THIS WAY OF LIKE TALKING TO YOUR ANXIETY AND AND THEN I'M JUST NOTICING YOU LIKE FELT REALLY GOOD ABOUT HOW IT WHELIKE EVEN THAT I THINK AS THAT'S LIKE THE BIGGEST THING NOW AND ARE LIKE CRAZY FAST WORLD REAL EVENGE JUST PAUSING TO NOTICE THAT'S ALREADY LIKE I CAPSILATING OR SAIND YOUR KID AND AND I THINK I GOT QUESTIONS ONLY A QUESTION WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER I LIKE SOMETNIMES WE ASK QUEST THAT THEY'RE JUST THEY'VE QUESTION MARKS BUT S LIKE A STATEMENT OR CRITICISM SOF WE SAY TO OUR KID UM THAT THAT THING I TAUGHT YOU WAS REALLY HELPFUL RIGHT YOU THINK THATS THAT WHAT WAS HELPFUL THAT'S NOT REALY A QUESTION WE ALREADY HAVE AN ANSWER IF I SAY HEY LIKE I DUES NOT O  BE GOOD FOR US TO TALK THROUGH FOR A SECOND LIKE WHAT WAS IT YOU THINK THAT LIKE LED YOU TO REALLY FEEL GOOD THAT DAY IN THE TEST THEN LIKE IF I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT MY KID COULD SAY I THINK THELL RECEIVE IT AND THEN THEY MIGHT SAY LIKE OH AS THAT THING WE TALKED ABOUT LIKE THAT'S SO GREAT TO KNOW I'M EVEN THINKING ABOUT SPANISH COMING UP AND LIKE I WONDERED YOU THINK THAT WOULD THINK I WONDER IS ALLSO A GREAT PHRASE FOR PARENTS JUST WONDERING I WONDER IF THA WOULD BE HELPEFUL THERE AGAIN THEY JUST LIKE LOWER DEFENSIVENESS CAUSE THERE'S HERE THERE'S LIKE MOVEMENT WITH WONDERING DOESN'T FEEL CONTROLLING IM SO YE I THINK I THINK THERE IS TIKE T THOSE ARE NICE MOMENTS IF IT COMES FROM A PLACE OF LIKE CONNECTION NOT FROM CONTROL I MAKE SENS UM WE TO GESS ON THIS PODCAST WE SU FELDMAN BERRIT HIS A WORLD EXPERT IN EMOTIONS AND I'M SHE EXCLAIND THAT UM IN CULTURES WERE THERE'S MORE NEW ANTS LANGUAGE FOR DIFFERENT EMOTIONS UM RATHER THAN THE WHAT I CALL THE EMOTIFICATION OF EMOTIONS UM THERE'S BETTER EMOTION TOLERANCE UM SO UNDERSTAND THAT IS NOT JUST SAD HAPPY DEPRESSED I THRILLED BUT THERE'S A LOT ON NEW AUNTS IT'S OR CONTEXT DEPENDENT I'M CAN BE VERY USEFUL UM DO YOU THINK THER'S SOMETHING BEGAIN FOR FRUM LETTIN KIDS UM EXPLORE THE RANGE OF EMOTIONS NOT JUST YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU FEEL GOOD OR BAD I' MEAN MOST ADULTS MEE TO LEARN TH GOOD OR BADER VALUATIONS THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY IN EMOTION YE HAWD IS NOT ACHING EXPRESSION HOW YOU FEEL BUT THAT'S WHAT WE DO OFOR SHORT HAND UM UNI DO YOU THINK THAT WHAT'S TO SAY IN THE NITED STATES UM BUT ELSEWHERE PERHAPS AS WELL THAT THERE'S SOME VALU TO  TEACHINK KIDS TO PAY ATTENTIONA LIKE WHAT IS GOING ON INSIDE YE  LIKE WHAT IS THIS FEEL ING OF WHAT I CALL ANXIETY IS IT EXCITEMENT AND ANXIETY WHAT LIKE BEING ABLE TO BETTER PIN POINT WHAT ONE IS UM COPING WITH BUT ALSO THE POSITIVE ASPECTS OF EMOTION YES I MEAN I AS MANY I IN THE CONICAL PSYCHOLOGIST THE QUESTION HOW DO YOU FEEL I ALWAYS FIND ILIKE A VERY LIKE A LOT OF FRESHUR I DON'T KNOW LIKE I THINK THAT I I TENT NOT O ASK MY KID THAT BUT I TET ALSO NEVER TO HAVE ASK LIKE PATIENTS THAT LIKE SO YOU KNOW I THINK WHAT WE'RE GETTING AT AS WE WANT AND I THINKS RELATES BRAZILIANS LIKE GRAZILIANS IS OURABILITY IN MY MIND TO TOLERATE THE WIDEST RANGE OF EMOTIONS AS POSSIBLE CAUSE LIKE AS HUMANSWERE IN A FEEL THAT WILL RANGE SO THE MORE OF THEM YOU'VE LEARNED TOLERATE LIKE THE BETTER OFF YOU'LL BE AND SA'S WHAT I WANT FOR MY KIDS I DON'T KNOW IF THE HAS TO EXPLICITLY COME FROM NAMING ALTHOUGH THINK THAT POINT IS DEFTLY TRUE THE MORE THINGS WE CAN NAME HE MORE THINGS WE CAN UNDERSTAND TO ME JUST SHOWING UP FOR YOUR KID IN A WAY THAT'S LIKE WITH BELIEVING MAY BE WITH BOUNDARIES UM IS PROBABLY THE BEST WAY TO ELP YOUR KID TOLERATE THE WIDEST TRANGE OF EMOTIONS CAUSE THEY LEARN EVERY EMOTION LIKE CAN BE HELD IN CONNECTION WITH SOME ONE ELSE RVERSES HELD IN ALONENESS THAN IS BAD UM S I GESS THAT'S WHAT I THINK THROUGHIT WE COULD TALK ABOUT ADOLESCENCE AND TEANAGERS A PHECIFICALLY UM TEENATERS ARE WILD I WE SAY THAT THE SINGLE MOST DRAMATIC AGING EVENT AND THE MOST RAPID RATE OF AGING THAT WE EVER EXPERIENCE IS PUBERITY I MAY JUST FUNDAMENTALLY BRAIN CIRCUITS THAT WERE FOR ONE THING OR THAT WERE DORMENT CHANGE AND COME ALIVE IN WAYS THAT THE WORLD FOREVER WILL LOOK DIFFERENT TO US IF FEEL DIFFERENT TO US AND OUR SELF PERCEPTION CHANGES PERIOD THIT SOMETHING THAT BILL JUST STILL UNDERSTAND IT A LEVEL OF WORMONES AND AN HYPOTHOLAMIC CIRCUITRY BUT THAT U HAS REALLY NOT BEEN MATCHED TO A PSYCHOLOGICAL UNDERSTANDING IN MISE VERSA SO UM LIKE NOTHING IS QUITE LIKE THE MUSIC YOU LISTEN TO WHEN YOUR TEANAGERIT LIKE BRINGS YOU BACK THE MEMORIES YOU FORM POSIVE ANNEGATIVE STAMP DOWN BOOM NOW AND FOR EVER THE EMOTIONAL SAILINTS CAN CHANGE BUT THOSE ARE WILD YEARS WHAT ARE SOME OF THE MORE CRITICAL NEEDS OF LAT ADOLESCENSE AND TEANS THAT NOR ACTIONABLE  YE YOU KNOW AND YEME JUST MY TEENIORS WERE WERE CRAZY BUT UM EVEN IF THEIR LESS CRAZY THEY'RE ALWAYS CRAZY YES YES SO AND ONE OF THE REASONS I THINK THEY LEAST IN AMERICA THAT ADOLESCINS SEEN AS SUCH A HUGE SHIFT LIKE MY KID IS AT A CONTROL THEY'RE ALWAYS OU THEY'RE LIKE ALWAYS REJECTING ME I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK IS UNRELATED TO THE BEHAVIOR CONTROL APPROACHES THAT ARE INHERENT IN AMERICAN PARENTANG CAUSE LIKE YOU REFERRED TO YOUR KID BECOMES FOURTEEN AND THEY KIND OF REALIZE LIKE WEI OM BIGGER THAN ONE OF MY PARENTS LIKE IWE DON'T CARE ABOUT THEIR STICK OR CHARTS ANY MORE AND WE MIGHT OFE MISS FOURTEEN YEARS OF BUILDING A RELATIONSHIP AND SO WHAT THAT KIDS ADOLESCENCE IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE IS MARKEDLY DIFFERENT THEN IF FOR THOSE PAST FOURTEEN YEARS YOU WAREN'T GIVING INT EVERYTHING NO BUT YOU ARE LEADING IN A STURDIER MORE CONNECTED WAY SO I REALLY THINK THIS WHOLE IDEA THAT AMERICAN ADOLESCENCSE LIKE REJECT EVERYTHING I ACTUALLY THINK NOT ALL OF IT A PART OF IS COMPLETELY DEVELOPMENTALLY NORMAL BUT A BIG PART OF IT RELATES TO THIS TRADITION OF BEHAVIOUR OF CONTROL THAT KIDS CANNOT REJECTAND TILL THE'RE AT THE AGE THAT THEY KIND OF COULD SURVIVE ON THEIR OWN WHICH IS ADOLESCENCE SO I THINK THAT'S RALLY IMPORTANT THE THINGS I WOULD TELL PARENTS TO REALLY KEEP IN MIND THAT ARE CRITICAL NUBER ONE IS RELATED THAT LIKE A TEAN'S JOB IS TO SEPARATE AND TO START TO FORM THEIR OWN IDENTITY AND I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS ABOUT THAT PARENTS NEED TO KNOW NUBER ONE LIKE I DON'T THINK WE PREPARE PARENTS ENOUGH FOR THE TRUE SENSE OF LOSS THEY FEEL WHEN THEIR KIDS ARE ADOLESCENCE TBECAUSE THAT'S VERY REAL LIKE YOU' JUST SPENT ALL THESE YEARS AND LIKE YOU'VE DRIVEN THEM T EVERY SOCKER AND THEY KIND OF TALK TO IN THE BACK SEA IT MAYBE YOU A FAMILY MOVING NIGHTS AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY DON'T WANT ANY OF THAT AND IT JUST SO IMPORTANT PERENTIONALLI I'M I'M GOING TO FEEL SAD I'M GOING TO FEEL LOSS AN IF WE DON'T KNOW TO EXPECT IT WE OFTEN KIND OF INFUSE THAT INTO A LOT OF ANGER TOWARD OR KID UM AND SO I JU THINK THAT'S NORMAL ND WE SHO TALK ABOUT THAT MORE PARENTS AFBOUT OLECENTYU TO BE TALKING OUT THAT WITH EACH OTHER OF COURSE YOU MISS THAT THAT'S TOTALLY NORMAL UM NUMBER TOO RELATED TO THAT SEPARATION YEU THIKG ABOUT IDENTITY FORMATION THE LIKE CURE'S A KID AN US IN WHER KIND OF CLOSE AND THE NOW ARE AT THE STAGE WE'RE DEVELOPMENTALLY THEI'R JOB AT THAT STAGEUST FIGURE WHO THEY ARE THEY HAVE TO OVER CORRECT LET YOU HAVE TO KIND OF OVER CORRECT IN THE AMOUNT OF SPACE YOU TAKE BECAUSE IT'SRELLY THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN FIGURE OUT LIKE WAI MEBY I DO WANT TO TAKE PARTS OF THAT THAT PARTS OKE AND SO I THINK THAT'S LIKE A POWERFUL IMAGE TO THINK ABOUT LIKE THEY ARE MOVING FAR AWAY THAT DISTANCE THEY TAKE FROM YOU IS NOT THEIR FINAL POINT THEY WILL MOVE CLOSER NOW GOINE MA LOSS NOT AS CLOSE AS THEY USED TO BE AND THAT IT'S DIFFERENT BUT THAT'S NOT THAT'S THIS IS THEIR WAY OF TREN TO FIGURE WHO THEY ARE NMI THEN THE LAST THING I'D SAY THAT KIND OF RELATES THAT IMAGE IS LIKE EVEN AS THEY MOVE AWAY I THINK PARENTS MASSIVELY UNDER ESTIMATE HOW MUCH THEY STILL NEED US THERE MAKING EFFORTS TO CONNECT AND I WAY THINK LIKE THE DIFFERENCE TINMIKE AND EXPLORER IN A NOMAD IS WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE A HOMEBASE AND LIKE AFORTEENS FEEL LIKE NOMADS IS NOT A GOOD SITUATION THEY'RE EXPLORERS THEY TRY A MILLION DIFFERENT THINGS BUT LIKE THEY THEY REALLY DO NEED US THEY THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT THEY AVE A HOME AND I'M I'LL NEVER FORGET MY PRIVATE PRACTICE I I USED TO WORK WITH TENS NOT THE LONGGO JUST TAN SOMETIMES THE PARENTS TOO AND THIS TEAM CAME TO ME IN THIS IS EXTREME SHEAD BEEN UM REALLY IN A IN A IN A BAD PLACE WITH HER PARENTS LIKE INTENSE INTENSE CONFLICT AN UM THEY GOT IN THIS HUGE FIGHT AND SHE'S REALLY REALLY UPSET SHE'S DESCRIBING THIS MA I N IN S I GER GE C YOU OUT YOU KNOW WAN I WAS U SIK SITYN ER LESS ANANGAN AND THAT SHE LIK CI I  CS NO I FLAM THE DOOR IT WAS AN COUPLE MINUTES LATER OPEN THE DOOR MARDE RASIN CAN YOU BELIEVE THEY WEREN'T THERE CAN YOU BELIEVE THEY WEREN'T THERE AND TO ME IT WAS JUST THE LIGHT ND AGAIN IT'S NOT ABOUT BEING A PUNCHING BAG BUT I LIKE UNDER AN THIK HER SEEMING ANGER AN HER LIKE INTENSE PAIN WE'RE SO CLOSE TOGETHER IN HER OWN STORY THAT IS JUS OVER AND OVER THE SAME THING LIKE THEIR GUNNER REJECT YOU THEY'RE GOING TO SAY GET OUT OF MY ROOM AND YES IT SOCKS BUT THEY WANT YOU TO SLIP A NOTE UNDER THEIR DOOR AFTER YOU'VE TAKEN A COUPLEOF MINUTES A SAYS THAT WAS REALLY TOUGH HER LIKE WELL THAT O OUT OF CONTROL YOU'RE A GOOD KITAN I LOVE YOU AND I IN JUST TALL PARENTS OF TEANS YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT THERE'S TEEN O BE A PAUS AND THEN YOU WILL HEAR THEM RIP UP THE NOTE YOU WON'T AND LIKE I WEAR TO ANY PARENT THAT THAT STILL RESINATED AND YOUR KIT IS AGAIN TRYING TO FIY ORE HOW TO I STAKE CLOSE WITH MY PARENTS AND FIGURING OUT MY OWN PARTWHO I AM SLY THEY RIP UP THE NOTE BECAUSE THEY THEY ALMOST LIKE HAVE TO DO IT TILL I CU TAKE IN HOW MUCH THEY ARE STILL DESPERATE FOR THOSE BITS FOR CONNECTION SOUNDS A LOT LIKE YUM THE DYNAMICS OF ADULT RELATIONSHIPS ALTHOUGH HOPEFULLY HOPEFULLY WITH A LITTLE BIT LESS UM DRAMATIC I A EXCENTUATION YO U BUT TEVEN EVEN IF IT DOES O INSICE THESE UM THESE CIRCUITS THAT ARE LAID DOWN IN CHILDHOOD EARLY CHILDHOOD THEY PERSIST RIGHT I MEAN I THINK IF ANYTHING HAS BECOME CLEAR TO ME AN UNDERSAING BRAIN DEVELOPMENT AND BRAIN FUNCTION ITS THAT YOU KNOW WE DON'T DISCARD CIRCUITRY FOR ATTACHMENT AND GO YOU KNOW THAT WAS FOR MAM AND THIS ONE WAS FOR DAD AND THAT WAS MUH FOR THE DOG AND U AND THEN THE  ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP IS DIFFERENT W REPURPOSE THE CIRCUITS MENS ALL THE BEAUTIFUL WORK ON CHILD HOOD ATTACHMENT THAT'S NOBBING TRANSLATE TO ADULT ATTACHMENT A MAY I REALIZE THEIR'S NEW WANTS TO IT BUT NO I WAS UM REFLECTING A BIT ON THIS AGAIN INCREDIBLY POTENT U PHRASE OR MENTION OF EXPLORERS WERSES NO MATS OF HAVING A HOME BASEAND THINKING ABOUT ATHESE PSYCHOLOGY EXPERIMENTS WERE CHILDREN ARE OBSERVED IN THE PRESENTE OF THEIR CARETAKERS SOMETIMES THE STRANGE SITUATION TASK WHEN IPLER SET KIDS ARE SEPARATED FROM THE MOMS THEN MOM UM IN CHILD TYPICALLY MON NOWADAYS THERE IT'S ALSO BEEN ON WITH OTHER CARETAKERS AND DATS REUNITE LIKE ONE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT THOSE EXPERIMENTS ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GO TO A PARK WERD BE OUT IN PUBLIC AN SEE A LITTLE TODDLER VENTURING AWAY FROM PARENT AND THEN WHAT O TEY DO EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE THEY LOOK BACK THEY'RE JUST TRYING A CHECK TO MAKE SURE THEE THERE EVEN THE KIDS THAT  TAKING OFF ON THE TRICYCLE LIKE CRAZY YES WE'LL AVENTUALLY STOP AND LOOK BACK IT'S LIKE THIS FUNDAMENTAL CIRCUIT WE'RE LOOKING BACK YOU KNOW AND HOW FAR THEY FEEL THEY CAN GO IS IN DIRECT RELATIONSHIP TO PRESENTLY THE NUMBER OF TIMES THAT THEY RECHARGE THAT THEY READ THAT THEY RECHARGE AND WERE ABLE TO SEE THAT AH THAT VERIFICATION THAT THE PARENT WAS STILL THERE I THINK THIS NOTION OF EXPLORERS VORS IS NOMADS AND UM BEING AN EXPLORER OBVOUSLY BEING A GOOD THING A HEALTHY THING UM WITHIN REASON UM AN NO MADS JUST FEELING A DRIFT UNTEATHERED YES NO ONE OS T ONE OF THE SCARIOUS WORDS AT LEAST TO ME IN UM IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE UM SO THE KNOTE UNDER THE DOOR YE UM IT INCLUDED THE WORDS I LOVE YOU I DON'T WANT TO GET TO A DETAILED HERE BUT THOSE WORDS SOMETIMES ARE NEVER SPOKEN IN OUR HOME SADLY A SOMETIMES ARE SPOKEN SO OFTEN AND UNDER SO MANY CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ONE WONDERS LIKE DOD THEY LOSE THEIR POTENCY AUH BUT I KNOWI IT IN THAT NOTE THEYE IT FINISHED I LOVE YOU IT'S ORE LIKE STADING AT THE END OF THE DAY NO MATTER WHAT U SA PROBAB EVEN WHAT YOU DO IENOG I'VE GON BEEN IN THE PRESENCE OF PARENTS OF KIDS THAT WERE CRIMINALS THAT DID HORRIBLE THINGS THEY STILL LOVE THEIR KIDS SO REMINDING KIDS THAT UNDER ANY IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES YEN AGAIN AND I THINK WHAT'S SO CRITICAL CAS OUR BRAIN COLLAPSESS THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU THINK THEIR BEHAVIOURS O KAY AND I GET THE FEAR LIKE I WOULD NEVER ONE TO SEND MY TO THE MESSAGE THAT IT'S O KAY O QUOTE DO CERTAIN THINGS I LIKE THAT HIT'S O KATOR TO SCREEM AT YOUR PARENTS OF COURSE IT'S NOT O KATIS JUST THINK WE MISS LIKE THAT HABIT THIKE THAT HAPPENED ALREADY LIKE IF I DROP MY PHONE IN A BROKE AND I WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WI BROKE TRY TO UNDERSTAND THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT' SO KAY THAT I DROPPED IT LIKE IT JUST THAT DOESN' IT IT JUST DROPPED THEY CULD ALREADY HAPPEN NOW AT HEU KNOW AND YE OUR KIDS NEED TO KNOW THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT THEY'RE LOVED AND THAT AGAIN THERE'S KIND OF LIKIN THAT MESSAGE I THINK LIKE I STILL SEE YOU'RE A GOOD KID UNDER THAT MOMEND AND I ACTUALYTHEY GET'S A POWERFUL STRATEGY FOR EVERY PARENT TO KIND OF CONJUROP A A GOOD KID IMAGE LIKE WHAT IS IT WAS TAT THAT LAST TIME WE WERE PLAYING THIS GAME AND IT WAS JUS SO FINEER IS IT A MEMORY OF MY KID WHEN THEY WERE THREE AND LIKE I DON'T KNOW THEY DID THIS REALLY KEEP THING AND A KIND OF LIKE REALLY CRYSTALLIZES THAT AND LIKE EVEN UNDERER YOU KNOW THIS BAD BEHAVIOUR THAT KID LIKE THAT KIDSTILL THERE AND THE KIDS THE KIDS WHO BEHAVE THE WORST ARE IN THE DEEPEST PAINT AND THE ADULTS T O AND THAT'S NOT THE SAY IT'S O KAY BUT IF AGAIN WHAT HO MUT RELATIONSHIPS WE WANT TO BE IN LIKE IF YOU'E NA RELATSIHIP WIH YOUR TEAN THIT'S NOT ONE YOU'RE LIKE THIS IS TOXIC LIKE THIS IS MY KID AND TO BE IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM SO YOU KNOW REMEMBERING THAT THEY'RE IN PAINTEANS ARE IN A LOT OF PAIN THEYRE EXPLORING A NEW WORLD FRANKLY RIGHT NOW LIKE TEANS HAVE WORLD WE DON'T UNDERSTAND IT THAT'S SO HELPFUL FOR PARENTS TO APPROACH YOUR TEAN JUST AS A TANGIBLE TOOLS I OU NOT THERE'S SO MANY THINGS IN YOUR WORLD THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND AND FRANKLY PROBABLY I MIGHT LIK CRITICIZE OR JUDGE LIKE CAN YOU TAKE OUT YOUR PHON THIS YOU KNOW WHATEVER IT IS THIS AP YOURE ON THIS VIDIO CAME LIKE CWE JUST EVEN TIME BOXES FIVE MINUTES LIKE I JUST WHEN IT END THIS CONVERSATION SAYING I UNDERSTAND IT BETTER LIKE I PROMISE YOU THAT'S PROBALY AN DO MORE FOR YOURE RELATIONSHIP WIT YOUR KID THAN ANYTHING ELSE BECAUSE YES THEY DO AND THEY MIGHT PROJECT YOU AND IF YOU DO AGAIN DON'T TAKE THE BAT BUT ASK AGAIN NEXT WEEK LIKE AGAIN THEY THEY DO THEY NEED US TOTO RETURN IF ONE THINGS FORE SURE NONE OF US EXCEPT THOSE THAT OUR TEANS KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE A TEA MATOR AND TWENTY TWENTY FOUR JUST LIKE IT IN KNOW WHAT IS LIKE TO BE A TEA MAJUR FOR ME IN THE LADDY'S EARLY NIHTES AH HOW COULD THE I I SO AH WHAT WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ON I FAMILY MEETINGS LIKE ONCE A WEEK WE SIT DOWN WE CHECKKIN Y I HEAR THE PEOPLE DO THIS MAY PROTUSTIPATE IN THESE BEFORE AH BITD YOU FEEL LIKE THOSE CAN BE USEFULRS IT ES IT MORE UM WENDOW DRESSIN I MEAN I GUSS IT DEPENDS WAS HAPPENING IN THERE I'MIN THE IDEA LIKE HAY THERE'S LOCK GOING ON IN OUR LIFE AND WE'VE A RITUAL OF COMING TOGETHER AND TALKING THINGS THROUGH WORKING THROUGH PROBLEMS LIKE IF THAT'S WHAT S THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING LIKE I HEAR THAT MY FIRST THOUGHT AS I SHOULD DO THAT YOU KNOW AOM BUT YOU'RE RIGHT LIKE LIFE GETS MESSY SO BUT IF IT'S DONE IN A WAY WHERE IT FEELS WE END AND EVERYONE FEELS A LITTLE BIT MORE UNDERSTOOD AND A LITLE BIT MORE PURPOSE AND YOU KNOW MAKING THINGS ME FORWARD IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION THAT'S AMAZING I THINK FAMILY MEETINGS IT'S AN ANT THE WAY I THINK BOUT THEM OFFIN WHICH IS JUST DIFFERENT IS IT'S ACTUYO A GREAT STRAGY ESPECIALY WEN YOUR KIDS ARE OLDER AND ON THERE'S LIKE SOMEWHAT OF AN ON GOING CONFLICT HO MAYBE THERE'S LIKE AN ON GOING CONFLIC O MACH VIDYO GAVE TIME OR YOU KNOW HOW MUCH YOU KNOW THEY HOW LATE THEY CAN STAY OUT AND TO SAY TO A KID AND AGAIN THESE JUST COMES FROM AGAIN SOME PORINT FOR TEANS WE HAVE TO APPROACH YOUR K KID LIKE WER ON THE SAME TEAM I  ME AND MY KID AGAINST A PROBLEM NOT ME AGAINST MY KID WHERE THEY ARE THE PROBLEM LIKE AND SO TO SAY HAY YOU'VE BEEN LATE YOU KNOW OR WE'VE TO FIG OUT YOUR CUR FEL AND LIKE LOOK YOU'RE A SMAR KID YOU'RE A GOOD KID MY NUMBER ONE JOB IS TO KEEP YOU SAFE BUT YOU'RE OLD NOW AND IF I JUST TELL YOU A TIME SCINCE SAME THING THE HAPPEN LAST YEAR WHOR YAN GET IN FIGHTS ALL YEAR WHAN N'T WE SIT DOWN AND WE WE'LL DO WHAT I DO O MYN OFFICE THERE'S TWO PEOPLE THET EACH HAVE IDEAS I'M TO BRING A PAT OF PAPER AND THT'S ECTULY SUPERIMPORTANT AND AM A WRIGHT DOWN ALL OF YOUR IDEAS IND MY IDEAS AND THE WERE JUS CON TO CON TO GO THROUGH AND CROSS OUT THE ONES AYOU NON'T FEEL COMPLETELY UN REASONABLE AND I'VE A FEELING WHEN WE DO THAT WE'RE IN TO COME TO A GOOD PLACE SO AGAIN YOU CAN SEE THERE'S THAT LIKE HOPE I'M GIVING LIKE I HOLD THE POSITIVE OUTCOME SAME TEAM I'M GIVING MY KID CREDIT IN ADVANCE TIS UCTNLIC REALLY SUCCESS USUALY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT TENS FEEL WHICH IS JUST MY PARENTS DON'T EVEN LISTEN TO ME OUR CARE AND THINK THEY HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS I'VE HEARD THIS NOTION OF YOU O UM COUPLE PARENTS COM FIRSED AND KIDS COMES SECOND A TAT AND SOME PEOPLER PI LIKE WHAT YOU KNOW ELL CLEARLY NEVER PARENTED A WELL NO ACTUALLY UM IT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA PERHAPS NOT CORRECTOR IN CORRECT BUT MAY BE DYNAMIC ACROSS TIME WHERE THE REAL QUESTION IS IF KIDS KNOW THAT THEY ARE RUNNING THE FAMILY IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY DO OR THEIR INABILITY TO NOT BE ATTENDED TO ET CETERA UM IS DRIVING THE WHOLE RELATIONSHIP THAT THE PARENTS ARE IN YE VERSES YOU KNOWT RECOGNIZING AND HER IMAGING TO PARENT HOME BUT WE TOCKERED OUT DIVORSE SOR PEOPLE WITH SIGNIFICG ANOTHERS OR SINGLE PARENT HOMES UM N THEN ALL OF THOSE UM GET A WONDER LIKE OR KIDS REALLY PAYING ATTENTION TO HOW MUCH THEY ARE BEING PRIORATIZE TO THE POINT WHERE IF THEY OBSERVE THEIR PARENTS TENDING TO THEIR OWN NEEDS THAT THEY FEEL DEPROVATION ORS IT MAKE THEM FEEL SAFER LIKE HEY MUM AND OR DAD ARE TAKING CARE OF THEMSELVES AND CAN SHOW IT BETTER YES I THINK THAT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ND A KIND OF GOES AGAIN TO BOUNDARIES LIKE OF APPARENT LYKE MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MY KID IS SO IMPORTANT AND I'M NOT IN O LET THAT TAKE OVER ME TIKE THAT IS NOT ALL OF ME I AM NOT ONLY A CARE GIVER TO MY PAM TO MY KID I I WOULD STAND BY THAT ALL DAY LONG LIKE AS THAT IMPORTANIT PART OF ME AND IT STILL A PART OF ME AND I THINK THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO OWN AS A PARENT CAUSE AGAN WE TEND TO GET APOTLY WE GET APOLOGISTS FOR IT ARE WE LOOK FOR OUR KIDTS PERMISSION WILL SAY LOOK I NEED TO GO OUT WITH DAD WITHOUT YOU HEY LIKE WE HAVE A RELATIONSHIP TO  LIKE AND WE AGAIN THERE'S THAT JOPB CONFUSION AND MY KID FEELS THAT AND AGAIN IT'S THAT KIND OF GIVING THEM TOO MUCH POWER I'VE SAID THIS TO MY KIDS A LOT SO AS THAT WHY DO YOUGO OUT WOULD DAD WITHOUT ME IT'S A GREAT QUESTION YOU DON'T FIRST OF ALL DAD AND I WERE MARRIED BEFORE WE HAD KIDS OUR RELATIONSHIP IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO US AND WE LOF BEING WITH YOU AND BEING WITH YOU IS DIFFERENT THEN JUST BEING THE TWO OF US AND THAT REALLY REALLY MATTERS TO US AND SO YOU ENOUGH TO BE HAPPY ABOUT IT YOU CAN YOU AND LET TH HAVE A BABY THAITR I KNOW THEY'RE SAFE WITH YOU CAN CRY WHEN I LEAVE AND THE BABIES THETTERAL HOLD YOU AND WORGAN GOT TO DINNER AND WORGAN A COME BACK AND YOU NOWILL SEE ONE MORNING YET I THINK THAT IS SO IMPORTAND I ACTUALLY THINK HIS ANTHER TOPIC I THIS TOIC OF LIKE RAGE AN PARENT IT IS LIKE A BIG TOPIC LIKE THE WAY WHY I BHY DO I GET TO THESE MOMENTS OF RAGE SO OFTEN THAT MY SCREAMING ITS NOT JUST SCREAMING IN MY KIDS IT'S REALLY RAGEFALL AND I THINK THE PARENTS OFTEN WHO ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE TO THAT ARE THE ONES WHERE THEY ARE NOT MAKE THEYRE NOT MEETING LIKE ANY OF THEYRE NON CARE GIVING NEEDS WHICH MAKE SENSE THAT A PART OF THEM IS SCREAMING NOW LIKE WHAT ABOUT ME I USE TO WHAT A DANCE CLASS I USED TO SEE FRIENDS I USED TO GO OUT WITH MY PARTNER AND TALK ABOUT THINGS OTHER THAN YOU KNOW OUR KIDS AND SO AGAIN IF I THINK A KIDS NEED A STURDY LEADER RIGHT MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IND STURDINESS IS NOT ALLOWING YOURSELF TO BE TAKEN OVER BY ANY ONE THING INCLUDING YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR KID IS IT TRULY BETTER FOR THEIR TO BE TWO STURDY LEADERS THAN ONE STURDY LEADER I REALIZE THIS IS A CONTROVERSIAL QUESTION  I MEAN I KNOW AND I KNOW THERE'S RESEARCH TOBACK THIS UP AT LIKE HAVING ONE AND OF STURDY LEADER IN YOUR LIFE IS MASSIVELY PROTECTIVE I REALLY BELIEVE THAT AND SO WHEN PARENTS WILL SAY MY PARTNER ISN'T MYE WE HAVE RESEARCSS IS TRUE IS TWO BETTER THAN ONE I DON'T KNOW THEIR RESEARCH PROBABLY I DONT KNOW YOU KNOW BUT WHAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT IN THEIR TOO IS IT WHAT'S NOT GREAT FOR KIDS IS HAVING LIKE ALL THE CAREGIVERS BE SOMEWHATE PERFECTLY A TUNED CAREGIVER RIGTY LIKE THAT ACTUALLY DOES NOT SET UP YOUR KID FOR LIFE AT ALL RIGHT BECAUSE I DO'T KNOW ANYON WHO THINKS THE PARTNER OMIN TO BE WITH ONE DAYS CAN BE PERFECTLE A TUNE TO ALL MY NEEDS LET ME GO FIND THAT PERSON SO YOU KNOW YOU AVE ONE STURDY LEADER YOU'VE TO BUT LIKE BE STURDY PART OF THAT IS YOU'RE ON YOU'RE GIN A RUPTURE YOU'RE IN A RUPTURE YOURE CAN A MESSUP YOU'RE GONA HOPEFULLY REPAIR YOU KNOW AFTER UM BUT STURDINESS AS WHEN MAKE THERE IS SO NOT THE SAME AS LIKE PERFECTION PERFECTION IS CREEPY IT'S NOT A THING I NOWIN YE WITHAT OT THAT UM SE PRESAMA OT ONON THI POT CANOSY LIKE THAT UM YET THE NOTION OF PROFECSION IS IS KIND OF CREEPY UM BUT STURDINESS IS ANYTHING BUT CREEPY THATS THEIR ISTISTISTI BEAUTIFUL WORD FOR ALL THE RIGHT REASONS OWHAT ABOUT BEHAVIORAL EXAMPLES IN PARENTS SO FOR INSTANCE IF CHILDREN OBSERVE PARENTS OM BEN AFFECTIONATE TO ONE ANOTHER IN APPROPRIATE WAYS RIGHT YOU KNOW UM YOU ATTENDING TO ONE ANOTHER IN IN BOUNDARY BUT IMPATHICALLY TUNE WAYS UM DO YOU THINK THAT PROJECTS FORWARD INTO THEIR NOTION OF OF WHAT A DON'T RELATIONSHIPS ARE LIKE AND SHOULD BE LIKE CONVERSELY IF PARENTS ARE YELLING AT ONE ANOTHER UM DO YOU THINK THAT PROJECTS FORWARD INTO IT'S OCATE A YELLIN ADON'T RELATIONSHIPS YOU AM IN I YEI THINK KIDS ARE THEIR EXPERT NOTICERS THEY NOTICE EVERYTHING WHERE IT IS PART OF HOW THEY'VE LEARN TO SURVIVE AS SUCH HELPLESS YOU KNOW HUMAN SO THEY DEFLY NOTICE THEY DEFINITLY ACT LIKE SPONGES UM SO YES OF YOURE YOU NO KIND OF PRIVILEGE ENOUGH IN THAT WAY TO GO UP IN HOME OR YOUVE PARENTS TO IN GENERAL ARE AFFAIRLY AFFECTIONATE THEY TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIARE STUFF THEY COMMUNICATE AND OUT THE WAY I THINK THAT IS LIKE A TRUE PRIVILEGE YOU GO INTO A TOLTHOOD WITH YES THE OTHER EXTREME RIGHT YOU GROW UP WITH PARENTS WO YOU KNOW THEY YELL OR THEY CAN EVEN YELLN SCARDY VOICES AGAIN WHAT I THINKS REALLY IMPORTANT IS THE WITNESSING OF THAT ISN'T GOING TO BE AS IN PACKFUL TO A KID AS THE WITNESSING OF IT AND NOBODY NAMING IT AN TALKING THEN ABOUT IT SO THIS A BI SO OFTEN LIKE KIDSWELL BE IN DIFFRICULT STAGES AND TENSE TAN DRUMS MAJOR SHE IS AT SCHOLALL AND SO AS IK WOO DO I DO LIKE WHAT DO I DO AT THIS WELL I GIVE YOU ALL THE STRATEGIES IN THE WORLD BUT IF THAT IS JUST YOUR KID'S WAVE KIND OF MANIFESTING ALL F THEIR STRUGGLES WITH THIS LIKE HUGE MARID OL CONFLICT HATS APPENING IT'S NOT CAN WORK SO IT'S ALL PART OF THE SAME SYSTEM AND SO SAYING TO YOUR KIT AFTER YOU FIGHT WITH YOUR PARTNER HEY I THINK YOU ARE DADDING N I SCREAMING AND I'M SURE THAT FELL SCAREY CAUSE IT DOES FELL SCAREY BECAUSE THEY KNOW YOU'RE THEIR BASE IF THEIR BASIS OF A HOUSE IS LIKE YOU KNOW FEEL LIKE AN EARTHQUAKE IF FEEL SCAREY LIKE AND YOU KNOW ANOTHER LINE I LIKE IS I YOU WERE RIGHT TO KNOTICE THAT WE WERE OUSING LOT VOICES AGAIN I THINK THAT'S MASSIVELY CONFIDENCE YOU KNOT BUILTING UM MAYBE WHAT WAS THAT LIKE FOR YOU OR FYOU'VE A LITTLEK KID JUST THAT'S ENOUGH YOU KNOWN THEY MIGHT LOOK AT YOU AND SAY LIKE TIME I SNACK NOW BUT IT'S STILL REALLY SUNKIN SO IF THERE IS A LOT OF CONFLICT AGAIN AND THEY IS REALLY IMPORTANT WHE WE TALK ABOUT THAT WITH OUR KEATS D DON'T LEAV THEM ALONG WHAT ABOUT TEENS THAT ARE REALLY WAYWARD UM AND THIS CULD BE BEHAVIOURAL OUTBURSTS THERE'S ALSO THE WHOLE UNDERSIDE OF THIS THING WHERE IT'S ALSO ABOUT WITHDRAWAL WY I KITS ARE WITHDRANOMY WE WERE TYIG ABOUT OUTBURSTS AND YELLING THERE'S ALSO THE EXAMPLE IN PARENTS OR THE INSANCES IN KIDS THAT IT'S LIKE REALLY WITHDRAWN YES THAT THEYRE JUST LIKE DISENGAGED DEPRESSED DEPRESSED UM MAYBE EVEN DISSOCY OF WHO KNOWS UM BUT NOT GOOD AND THIS CAN SHOW UP ON ONE END IS VIOLENCE ON THE U OTHER END IS ISOLATION AND IT CAN SHOP AS EATING DISORDERS AT CONSHOP AS ALL SORTS OF THINGS UM YOU KNOW INTERVENTION BEFORE AGE EIGHTEEN IS CONICL EASIER IN THE SENSE THAT ONE HAS LEGAL CONTROL BUT OFTENTIMES IT'S HARD FOR PARENTS TO KNOW LIKE HOW BAD IS THIS AND YOU KNIW I DIDN'T ENTIRE EPISODE ABOUT CANABAS AND NIGHTS TO SPOKE TO SOME OF THE MEDICAL BENEFITS OF CANABAS FOR ADULTS WHO ARE NOT ATICS BUT I ALSO TALK A LOT ABOUT SOME OF THE RISKS BUT LET'S TAKE AN EXAMPLE THAT THING IS PRETTY COMMON LIKE KITS FIFTEEN SIXTEEN STARTS SMOKING SOME T H SA WITH THEIR FRIENDS AND YOCOEVER AND DOES THAT CNCO NOT A AL COHALL WHICH I THINK IS LAME ARGUMENT AS THIS IS LAME DOESN'T MANYE SENSE AGET YOU CAN'T KIT BY A YOU CARRS IN BAS GAING HIT BY TRAIN BUT O KA UM BUT THE POINT IS YOU KNOW MOST ALL PARENTS LIKE O K YOU KNOW THE CLEARLY THEIRE SELF MEDICATING YOU KNOW CAN'TS THEY THINK THEY CAN'T STOP THEM BUT YOU CAN'T STOP THEM YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT POINT DO YOU THEN TAKE YOU KNOW YOU PUT THEM INTO A RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT PROGRAM IF YOU COULD EVEN AFFORD THAT I MEAN IT'S REALLY TOUGH FOR PEOPLE TO KNOW HOW MUCH TO INTERVENE IN WHAT IS CLEARLY NOT GOOD BEHAVIOR IN AND SOMETIMES CAN BE BAD BEHAVIOR AND YT THE KIDS ARE USING ITS O SELF MEDICATE AND THERE'S A PIER SYSTEM THAT SOMETIMES REINFORCES THAT  AND THIS A HUGE LANDSCAPE Y MAY WE HAVE YOU BACK TO TALK JUST ABOUT THIS BUT BUT OM MAYBE WE CAN OPPRESSES THAT DISCUSSION BUT BY M LIKE WHAT YOU TELL PEOPLE IN YOUR YOU'RE RACTISE I GET IN THER NOW PO THE EMERGENCY COURD AND GET THIS HANOFOLD WHORD YOU SAY LISTEN YOU JUST GOT A WORK WITH THE YOU KNOW WORK WITH THE SISTEM IN TALL PROBLEM ON THROWING AT YOU YOU HA I THINK THE FIRST THING IS IKE HOWTOWI IS A PARENT LIKE KIND OF EVEN A SESS IS LIKE THIS LIKE IS THIS NORMAL IS IT NOT MOREL IS HAT A PROBLEM IS IT NOT SO I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE LIKE THINGS WE COALD THINK ABOUT THERE NUMER ONE JUST SEEING LIKE IMPACKT ON OVER ALL FUNCTIONING IS ALWAYS LIKE A  ONE BAROMETER RIGHT SO OKAY CAN MY CHILD PERFORM THE KIND OF TASKS OF THEIR DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE OKI THIS IS NOT THE ONLY THING BUT LIKE ARE THEY STILL GOING TO SCHOOL WHILE I NOTICEINCE THEY SMOKING THEY'RE SMOKING LOT OF WEEDS THEI'RE GREEDS WENT FROM BEES TODEES LIKE OKAY THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT SCHOOL ANY MORE THEY USED TO ACTUALLY GO OUT WITH FRIENDS NOW UNLESS THEY'RE WITH THIS ONE CREW WHERE THEY SMOKE IN THE PARK LIKE THEY'RE NOT EVEN SEEING THESE KIDS THEY USED TO BE FRIENDS WHAT THEY DO'T WANTO GO TO FAMILY FUNCTIONS ANY MORE THEY USED TO PLAC SOCKER LIKE IF I ANSWER IS I  WHIL I'M NOT REALLY TALKING JUST ABOUT A MARAWANA PROBLEM I'M TALKIN MOUT MY KID NOT ENGAGING AND KIND OF LIKE THE DEVELOPMENTAL TASKS THAT I WOULD SAY IS JUST LIKE IT'S TIME TO SEEK ADDITIONAL SUPPORT RIHT ANOTHER SIGN IS JUST KIND OF HOW HOW LIMITED THEIR WORLD HAS BECOME BEBECAUSE OF THIS RIGHT SO AGAIN IS THIS KIND OF TAKING OVER EVERYTHING THEY DO MY KID IS DEPRESSED LET'S SAY OR YOU KNOW AND ALL THE SUDDEN THEIR WORLD HAS GOT IN REALLY REALLY SMALL AND IT'S NOT JUST THAT THAT'S THE WAY THEY'VE ALWAYS LIVE LIKE THERE'S A BIG THERE'S A BIG CHANGE THE AMUNT OF CONFLICT IN THE HOME AGAIN LIKE IS THEIRE CONFLICT WHEN YOU'VE TEANS OF COURSE THERE IS BUT LIKE WELL LIKE IS IT REALY HARD TO TALK TO MY TEAN FOR MORE THAN FOUR MINUTES WALKING ON EGG SHELLS TO ME IS ALSO A SIGN THAT WE NEED ADDITIONAL HELP AND MI SCARED TO INTERVENE IN A WAY THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE IN LINE WITH MY VALUES THAT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN RIGHT THEN THE OTHER THING I ONE I MAY SHAREOF MY NOSEIS O ME LIKE SEEKING ADDITIONAL HELP IS A SIGN OF EVERY SINGLE THING THAT'S RIGHT WITH A FAMILY AND I THINK WE THINK IT'S A SIGN OF SOMTHING THAT'S WRONG AND IT'S LIKE ALSO A SIGN OF WHAT'S RIGHT TO YOUR IN TERMS A MESSAGING THAT TO YOUR KID AGAIN I THINK ABOUT A KID WHO I USED TO SAW SE  MY PRACTICE WHOAS PRIVED SIXTEEMEN TO CAME TO ME SHE WAS CUTTING SERIOUS I A LOT RIGHT I REMEMBER SAYING JUST AND TAKE HALING OF BEEN DOING THIS SE'S TWO YEARS O I DID TOU SEE ANOTHER THARAPIST BEFORE YOU SAW MAN US LIKE NOW SHO'S LIKE VERY LIKE KIND OF YOU KNOW KIND OF QUIPPY AND QUICK AND I'VE JUST LIKE WHY AND JUSA WELL I TOLD MY PARENTS THAT IF THEY TOOK ME TO A THARABIST I WOULD GO AND I WOULD UST PLASE ALL THEIR MONEY I' BE QUIET AND THN WHEN THEY LEFT ME THERE I WOULD THIEVE AND WHO'S IN A STOP A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD FROM WALKING AWAY AND THEY MIGHT AS WELL SAVE THEIR MONEY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T MEET ME I AND AGAIN I JUST KIND OF SENSE TO STAY QUIET AND SHES SERIOUSLY ONE OF THE NEXT THING SHE SAID IS CAN YOU BELIEVE THEY LET ME MAKE THAT DECISION LITERAL SAID THAT WELL VALIDATES EVERYTHING YOS TAT OF ANTLEMAN IT IS THIS IS WHY THIS IS WHERE LIKE I FLIKE I GT MY BEST IDEAS LIKE THAT'S RIGHT LIKE A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD CAN CONVINCE HER PARENT THAT SHE WON'T GO TO THERAPY WHEN SHE'S CUTTING LIKE THAT THAT IS NOT OK AND AGAIN THEN WE GO TO OKASE ON TMI SAY TO M CAN YOU ARE GOING I MIGHT KNOW THERE'S SO MUCH BETWEEN THAT WHERE IN THESE BINAIRY STATES YOURE KID'S FEELINGS ABOUT THERAPY CANNOT DICTATE YOURE BOUNDARY I BUT WE CAN'T JUST THEN COME DOWN HARSHLY AND SO I COACH PARENTS IN THIS ALL THE TIME WHAT YOU SAY TO KID I LOVE YOU HEARE ME I LOVE YOU WE'RE IN A TOUGH STAGE I SEE THIS PROBLEM AND I DO THINK EVENWHEN OUR KIDS GET OLDER WE CAN SAY THIS MY NUMBER ONE JOB IS TO KEEP YOU SAFE IT IS NOT TO KEEP YOU HAPPY WITH ME AND I ACTUALLY LOVE YOU SO MUCH THAT I'M WILLING TO DO THINGS THAT MAKE YOU UNHAPPY WITH ME THAT IS ACTUALLY HOW MUCH I CARE ABOUT YOU AND SO I AM GON TO BE DRIVING YOU AND IF YOU WONA LIKE CURSE ET ME THE WHOLE TIME I'LL SIT IN THAT WAITING ROOM AND YO IMEN DO THE NEXT WEEK AN I TELL YOU I LOVE YOU EMANENT DO THE SAME THING AND I THINK A DOLDS HEARING THAT ON SOME LEVEL THERE'S SOME INTERNAL TRUTH PROBABLY NEED LIKE THAT FEELS ODDLY GOOD BECAUSE THERE'S YOU KNOW I'M NOT MESSING AROUND BUT THERE'S TIS WAY WHERE'S PARENT YOUE SI LIKE THE WAY TO SHOW MY KID I'M NOT NESSING AROUND IS TO BE MEAN TO THEM LIKE THERE IS NOTHING MEAN ABOUT WHAT I SAID I THINK IT WAS MORE LOVING THEN SAYING TO A KID O KAY LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU WANT TO GO THAT IS NOT LOVING AND SO I THINK LIKE OURTEEN SOMETIMES IN THOSE MOMENTS THEY NEED US TO DO OUR JOB AND LIKE BE THE PILOT LIKE THEY IT IS THE SMALL AMOUNTIMEWHERE THEYRE STILL A PASSENGER WHEN THEY'RE EIGHTEEN THEY ARE THE PILOT AND SO WE HAVE THIS WINDOW S NOTHIN A WOI PRO MOREIN TO THAT I THINK YOUYOU CAPTURED IT IBEAUTIFULLY AN I GET'S BACK THIS IS SER SAFETY WHY YES AN LETTING THEM MAKE THEIR OWN DECISION WHEN THEYRE CLEARLY IN TROUBLE LIKE IF ANYTHING TO MAKE A KID FEEL UNSAFE A TEEN OR OR YOUNGER OR DULT IT'S THAT YES YES SI GLAING THE PASSAGER ON WWE LIKE INSTEAD OF A REROUDING HOW BUT YOU JUST COME UP HERE AND FLY THAT'S EKE THAT'S EXACTLY THAT'S LITERALLY WHAT IT IS AND THEY'RE LIKE I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU BELIEVED MY LITTLE PROTEST NOW I'M IN THE COCKPIT LIKE THE THEY DON'T THY DN'T WANT THAT THAT'S WHY THEY'RE WORDS TEEN'S WORDS IT'S NOT THAT WE DON'T BELIEVE THEM LIK THA SANTUSCAN BE UN BELIEVING THEY'RE WORDS OFTEN ARE A REPRESENTTION OF THEIR FEARS ALL OF US IN ARE WORST MOMENTS GET OUT LIKE I FEEL LIKE SOMETIMES LIKE THAT'S THEIR FEAR E'RE LIKE THE'RE KIND OF TALKING TO THEIR EMOTION THEY'RE SIT LIKETHEY'RE NOTREALLY TALKING TO YOU AND THAT MOMENT THEY'RE SO DISREGULATED AND LIKE JUST LEARNING TILL IKC NOT TAKE IT SO LITERALLY AND BE LIKE WHAT AM I REALLY BELIEVING MY KIT ISN'N PAIN THEY'RE CUTTING MY KIT ISNI'T PAIN THEIRE SMOKING WEED THIRTY TIMES A DAY AND DON'T CO TO CLASSIC I'M THE I KNOW THAT THEY THAT THEY NEED HELP AND AGAIN ANY PARENT WHOU CAN SAY THAT LIKE TO ME IS LIKE THE STR WRONG GUEST PARENT AND THAT IS SUCH A SIGN OF HEALTH I DON'T THINK I'D STILL A BE ALIVE TO DAY IF IT WASN'T FOR ANONPARENT MENTORS AND JUST EXAMPLES IN THE WORLD TTHESE AREN'T ALWAYS PEOPLE THAT W LIKE HA I MA TAKE YOU UNDER MY WAY PURE MENT TOR ASHEOS RARELY THE CASE BUT PEOPLE IN MY REAL LIVE FOR IN MY UM YOU KNOW READING OR YOTHER WASN'T YOU TWO BACK THEN BUT SOMETIMES NOW YOUNG PEOPLE IVE I MA HEACH FAN FORINCEST OF THAT THESE SA YOU LE IN PSYCHOLOGIST JAMES HOLLIS WHO HAS THESE BEAUTIFUL LECTURES ON OM MAKING A LIFE UM AND I'M LEARNING SO MUCH I CA CONSIDER MOMENTOR SIR JAMES YOU DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE YOU'RE YOURE MENTOR BUT THESE PEOPLE THAT WE CAN INTERNALIZE CERTAIN HEALTHY ASPECTS THAT ARE PARENTS JUST JUST APPARENTLY CAN'T SEEM TO ARRANGE FOR THEMSELVES AND THAT WE WISH THEY HAD BUT I THINK THAT WE AUM AS CHILDREN OF ALL AGES UM LIKE WE WANT PERFECT PARENTS WE DON'T GET THEM UM BUT IT SEEMS APPROPRIATE TO ME AT LOF YOUR THOUGHTS IT SEEMS APPROPRIATE TO ME TO HAVE YOU KNOW V A FORAGING FOR EXAMPLES OF WERE WE CAN GET CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE CAN INTERNALIZE FOR OURSELVES SO THAT WE CAN BENEFIT THAT MAY BE OUR PARENTS JUST AREN'T INTERESTED IN CAPABLE OF OR EVEN ALIVE TO PROVIDE US ANY MORE YE YET I MEAN THAT LIKE BEING EVERYTHING TO SOME ONE LIKE I DON'T WANT MY KIDS TO EVER SAY THAT ABOUT ME MI MA WAS EVERYTHING SHE FULFILLED MY EVERY NEED AGAIN I I DO FIND THAT CREEPYN WHENEVER OR NOW AND LIKE AND JUST SETTING THEM UP FOR SO MUCH RELATIONSHIP DISAPPOINTMENT AM MY MAM GAVE SOME THINGS AND YOU NOW WE NOW THAT I AL SO WORK A LAT AS ON IS MY KIDS LIKE THERE IS THIS MAM LIKE WHEN KIDS HAVE A SLEEP OVER HEUR HOUSE I MEAN IT IS THE THASLEEP OVER EXPERIENCE LIKE ICY PICTURES ON MY WOUT THAT WAS SO THOUGHTFUL THAT WAS AMAZING SHE'S LIKE SHE PUTS IT  SHE'S CREATIVE LIKE AND ME MY KIDS CHILLED IKE NERLY GET MOM YOU DEAR LIKE BOTTOM OF THE LIST AND NOT STUFF AND I AM I AM AND LIKE I KNOW I'M TOWARD THE TOP OF THE LIST AND OTHER THINGS I DON'T I DON'T WANT TO BE TOWARD T FORSO I WANT ALL MYSELF TO THAT STANDARD THAT'S LIKE A GREAT WAY TO EMPLOYED SO YE BEING ABLE TO SAY TO MY KID OH YOU HAS ONE OF US LEEP OVER YOU'D RATHER GO TO HER HOUSE CAUSE THAT'S OH I THAT SOMN INDICTEMENT OF ME AND SO MAY BE THIS IS SOME QUOT MEN TO ARE LIKE FIGURE OF FIR SOMEWHNE YOU CAN LIKE PUT THESE DETAILS AND MAKE PEOPLE FAIL REALLY TAKIN CARE OF IN THAT WAY THAT'S GREAT AND I THINK GUEST GIVE ME YOUR KID PERMISSION AN ENCOURAGEMEN AGAIN I THINK OF SUCH A GIFT TO THEM LATER ON LIKE YE OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR KIDS BECOMES NOT NLY THE FOUNDATION THEY'RE EXPECTATIONS FUR THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER NELTS MEN I ALSO THINK I'S LITTERLY WHA THEY'RE ATTRACTED TO THINK WHEN THEY'RE ATTRACTED TO SOMEONE LATER ON IS JUST THE ACTIVATION OF THAT LIKE EARLIEST ATTACHMENT AND SO IF THEY CAN GET ACTIVE ATED ROUND SOME ONE WHO SEEMS TO BE PRETTY ATTUNED AND RESPECTFUL AND VALIDATING AND BOUNDARY BECAUSE THEY ALLSO OF OTHER THINGS IN THEIR LIFE AND NOT EVERYTHING LIKE THAT'S A PRIVILEGE TO SAY THAT'S WHAT I'M EXPECTING SO I THINK THOSE OTHER RELATIONSHIPS AND AS A PARENT TO HEAR YOUR KIDS AND MY COACH TAUGHT ME THIS THING AND  SOMESAYS THEY SAY IT IN A CADDY WAY SO MUCH BETTER THEN WHAT YOU SAID TO DO AT LA CROSS JUST A LIKE TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND AGAIN THIS IS WHRE YOU CAN SAY LIKE I'M STILL A GOOD PARENT EVEN OUTSIDE THIS MOMENT THAT'S I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE TALKING TO ME ABOUT THIS I BELIEVE YOU TELL ME MORE ABOUT THIS LIKE SUCH A BEAUTIFUL EXAMPLE FYR KID SOME BEING ABLE TO ITALIDATE AND EMBRACE THE FACT THAT THEYRE OTHER SOURCES OF HEALTHY UP BRINGING AM IS YE NONJUST PERHAPS IS IS CLEARLY A GOOD THING TT LAT RIGHT I THINK THAT'S RIGHT AND I THINK IF THAT'S HARD FOR A PARENT BUT I'D SAY IS THEY GIT'S A QUESTION WITHOUT AN EXACT ANSWER ABLIGWARD WHERE DID I LEARN THAT I'M SUPPOSED TO BE EVERYTHING TO SOME ONE LIKE AND IS THAT AND I THINK A LOT OF WOMEN WE LEARN THAT IN OUR FAMILIES OF ORIGIN TO BE GOOD GIRLS WHICH REALLY JUST MEANS I'VE NO WANTS AND NEEDS MY OWN AND I JUST KIND OF GAZE OUT AND SEE HOW I CAN DO THINGS FOR YOU AND I CAN BE EVERYTHING FOR YOU ANDTHEN WE HAVE KIDS WE DON'T REALIZE WE PUT THAT ON TO THEM THI TIKE YOU SAID THOSE PATERNS TRAVEL WITH US AND I FIND IT LIKE VERY BELIEVING MAYBE WI IF I DON'T WEL I JUST GAVE ME LIKE A GOOD PERCENTAGE OF ENERGY BACK LIKE I CAN MI CAN DO LIKE SO MANY OTHER THINGS NOW YOU KNOW IT'S VERY IT'S LIKE COMPOWERING WOF IT SOMETHING THAT IT'S AN UNPLEASANT TOPIK JUST BY AS SOON AS PEOPL HEAR THE WORD BUT IT'S SOMETHING THET THINK IT COMES UP ON THIT CHILD SIDE THE TEANSIDE IN THE PARENTING SIDE AND DON'T RELATIONSHIPS OF ALL KIND WHICH IS THE DREADED ENTITLEMENT DIRTY WORD AND PARENTING AND TITLEMENT AH THEN WE COAN PUT SOME DEFINITION ON ENTITLEMENT AND TALK ABOUT AM WHEN IT'S BAD IS IT ALWAYS BEEN A WHEN IT'S NEUTRAL AND WHEN IT'S EM NO IS IT EVERY GOOD IT'S TITLE IT DOESN'T STOW WIKE GISON IDO BUT YET I  HEALTH THERE IS A HEALTHY ENTITLEMENT RAND I THINK THAT IS KIND OF THE ENTITLEMENT TILL LIKE I'M ALLOWED TO WANT THINGS AND I'M A LEA ALLOWED TO A MOMENT'S MY LIFE EVEND ACT ON THAT TO TURN THAT WANT INTO A FULFILMENT OF MY WANT I THINK THAT ACTIALL GOES BACK TO WHL WE'RE JUST SAYING LIKE FIRST IS HOW CAN I PLEASE YOU LIKE MAYBE I WANT TO DO SOMETHING SO I THINK THAT HEALTHY ENITLEMENT THAT'S A GOOD THING WHEN I THINK I WHEN I HEAR PARENT SAY LIKE PLEASE ITS DON'T WANT AN ENTITLE KID HEY'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT RIGHT AND THEY'RE TALKING ABOW AND TO ME THIS STORY FOR MY PRACTICE IS JUST THE KEY THING THAT MAKES US PARENTS CRINGE WAS THIS FAMILY OF SEEING YOURK CITY AND THEY THEY WERE THE'RE VERY WEALTHY AND THEY AD THE SIXTEEN YEAR OLD SON AND THY'RE FLYING BACK FROM HO OR TWO WHOI THEY'RE JUST GETTING READY TO BOARD AND FIRST CLASS IS BOARDING AND THE SUN GOES UP AND THE'RE LIKE OTS WE WERE NOT THEY CAN FIRST GLASS WE'VE TO WAIT AN A BASICALLY A FULL TANTRUM IN THE ARPART LIKE EVERY PARENTS FOR AST NIGHTMARE LITERALLY AND IT CAME TO ME AFTER IT'S BEING A COW DID WE LIKE HOW DID WE GET HERE RIGHT NOW THIS IS A FAMILY IN GENERALS SURE THEY THEY FLEW FIRST CLASS THEY PRIVATE PLAY ANS HAD A LOT OF YOU KNO MONEY BUT ENTITLEMENT TO ME DOESN'T ALWAYS HAVE TO BE ABOUT BODY I'M T GIVE YOU MY DEFINITION OF ENTITLEMENT I THING IS VERY DIFFERENT BUT TO ME THE DEFINITION LIKE BOUNDARIES IS USEFUL BECAUSE IT GIVES YOU A PATHWAY OF WHAT TO DO I THINK IN TITLEMEN IS THE FEAR OF FRUSTRATION BEAUTIFUL BECAUSE I WE GO BACK OKAY THAT THING DIDN'T START AT SIXTEEN AND IF WE WE STARTED OUN I STARTED CONCOLLECTING STORIES AND RIGHT THIS IS A KID WHO THED AND AGAIN LIKE THEY HAD A DRIVER THE NOTHING ROTT HAVING A DRIVER BUT I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT LIKE WAITING FOR A SUBWAY FRUSTRATING JUST MIES THE SUBWAY WOR GON O BELAT LIKE NOW RIGHT THIS WAS A KID WHO DIDN'T MAKE IS SAD I SED ONT I REMEMEBER LIKE THET MAKE THE SOCATIN DON'T WRIT WE HAVE SOMEONE WHOS IN AO TAKE YOU TO THE NEAR BY TOWN NEW JERSEY AND GET ON THAT SOCRATINE RIGT I'M AND I THINK ABOUT WHAT THIS KID STARTED TO LEARN ABOUT BEING FRUSTRATED AND IT WAS KIND OF LIKE FRUSTRATION COMES UP AND WHAT GETS LAYERED NEXT TO IT IS SOMEONE ELSE BRINGING YOU AN EXIT FRUSTRATION EXIT FROM FRUSTRATION MAYBE EVEN EXSIT TO SUCCESS RIGHT ANDTHEN I TURND TO THINK THAT WHAT WOULD IT BE LIKE IF THERE IS SIXTEEN YEARS OF KIND OF EXISS IS HAVIT OF THAT PATTERN AND NOT CIRCUIT REINFORCING CAUSE WHAT YOU'RE REALLY LEARNING AS A KID I'M FRUSTRATED AND THAT'S VERY OVERWHELMING FOR ME BUT LIKE THE ADULT SURROUND ME MUST BE SCARED OF MY FRUSTRATION BECAUSE THEY WON'T LET ME SIT IN IT THEY WON'T LET ME FEEL IT THEY WILL ACTUALLY KIND OF RUN IN CIRCLES TO TO NOT HAVE ME FEEL SO I ACTUALLY IN CODE MY FRUSTRATION NEXT TO FEAR NOW I'M SIXTEEN AND I'M EXPECTING FIRST CLASS AND I GET YOU N A LOWLY COD YOU KNOW IT'S NOT PEOPLE ARE IT LIKE OH WHAT A SPOILED KIDLIC I ACTUALLY I I FEEL LIKE THIS KID WAS THE INSANELY VULNERABLE IN THAT MOMENT THIS KID WAS LIKE I'M FRUSTRATED AND WHAT I EXPECT TO HAPPEN AND WHAT I KNOW TO HAPPEN ISN'T HERE AND SO IT IS EXPLOSIVE IT APPERS AS ENTITLEMENT ON THE SURFACE BUT IS A DEEP INTOLERANCE AND ALMOST FEAR OF FRUSTRATION WHICH IS IN YOUR BODY SO YOUR TERRIFIED OF A FEELING THAT IS LIVING IN YOUR BODY AND IT LOOKS DEMANDING BECAUSE IT KIND OF IS DESPERATE LIKE YOU CAN'T LET THIS HAPPEN  FEAR FRUSTRATION AS THE DEFINITION OF ENTITLE WEN A LENCE WAKE SQUARE IN THE BULLS EYE FOR ME UM AND YES I THING WE ALL DEFAULT TO THE COUNT OF STIRITYPICAL EXAMPLE OF THE THE ULTRA WEALTHY FAMILY KID OTHERS THAT WILL BE THE TOY N THE ATIES IS REALLY DREADFUL CONCEPT ISHAOUN A KID THAT WAS JUST GIVEN EVERYTHING AND THEN WANTED A PERSON IS REALLY LIKE TALK ABOUT FOUL I MUSE TO SAY IT YOU KNOW JUST BAD AT EVERY LEVEL AN THEN THEY TRYD TO YOU CREATE THIS NARRATIVE WERE THEN YOU KNOW THERE'S A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING ABOUT HUMANS AND OF TET VALLS FROM IT BUT BUT THE STARTING POINT WAS YOU KNOW AND I I'VE OBSERVE THIS IN CERTAINLY NOT MY FAMILY BUT OTHER FAMILYES WEARE KIDS ARE GIVEN EVERYTHING THEY WANT IT NEVER FEELS LIKE ENOUGH THIKS SURPRISE DON PE ME IT'S A REAL THING THE CIRCUITS RECALEBRATE TO A HIGHER THRESHOLD THEY WANT MORE AND MORE AND MORE S LIKE THAT MOBE WALL STREET WHAT'S YOUR NUMBER MORE O GI I AM NOTHING WRONG WITH WANTING THINGS AN BUT WITH WITHOUT IT A SEALING ON ANY OF THAT AND WITHOUT A A SEALING ON UN PLEASURE BOUNDS ON EXPERIENCE IT CRUSHES EVERYBODY THAT'S ALSO WITHOUT MOVE YOU AS ABOUT IT JUST CRUSHES PEOPLE SO TO BUILD THAT INTO A CHILD'S NEUROLOGY JUST SEEMS LIKE THE WORST POSSIBLE THING AND BECAUSE IT'S NOT ABOUT THE WORLD BEING A PLACE OF IMMENSE POSSIBILITY IT'S ABOUT THE WORLD BEING A PLACE OF OF LIKE SNAKES IN BROKEN GLASS EVERYWHERE EXCEPT THIS NARROW NIFE EDGE PATH THAT YOU FOLLOW THAT IS ALL ABOUT INFINITE RESOURCES AND EASE THAT'S FRIGHT AND IT WHEN I THINK AS FEAR IS CAUSE IF YOU'RE IN FEAR YOU'RE IN LIKE A THREAT STATE WHICH IS WYIT WHEN KIDS ARE IN THE SAY OR ADULTS IT SEEMS LA NASTY LIKE AN IT'S MEN WHEN YOUR YOU KNOW AND TERE'S JUST LIKE NARROWING OF YOUR EYES FRIGHT SO I THINK THAT'S REALLY YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING AND IT'S NOT IT'S NOT ALWAYS TIED TO MONEY BUT THE TRUTH IS AN IMONEY CAN EASILY BUY A KID'S WAY OUT OF FRUSTRATION AND BY THE WAY IT BUYS THE PARENT OUT OF HAVING TO TOLERATE THEIR FRUSTRATION WHILE THE KID IS FRUSTRATED AND SO IT'S TRICKY I THNK I'VE I'VE NOW LIKE YOU DON'T TALK TO A BUNCH OF PARENTS WHO GREW UP AN UM A VERY DIFERENT WAY WERE VERY SUCCESSFUL AND I GET IT THE'RE LIKE I FEELIKE IVE I'VE EAR IE LITERALLY HAVE EARNED THE RIGHT TO HAVE CERTAIN PART OF MY LIFE FEEL LIE EASIER RIGHT AND LIKE HOW TO WI THOUGH NOT HOW TO I RAISE A KID WHO ISN'N ENTITLED RIGHT AND IT IS A CONUNDRUM RIGHT INK I N'T THINK LIKE YOU KNOW WE RAISE OUR YOU RAISE OUR KIDS IN A CANDY STORE IT'S HARD TO EXPECT THEM TO APPRECIATE CANDY RIGHT AND SO LIKE HOW TO WE HOW TO WE BOUND LIKE GRATITUDE THE ENTITLEMENT AND I DO THINK THOUGH THAT IDEAS LIKE WE JUST HAVE TO  SOMETIMES LIKE OTHER PEOPLE HEARING THIS TO BE LIKE YALLIC MY LIFE IS FRUSTRATING ALL THE TIME AND SOME PEOPLES ARE RIGHT THEY WON'T END UP WITH ENTITLEMENT BUT FOR OTHER FAMILIES THEY DON'T HAVE O BE LIKE I I HAVE TO LIKE DOSIT I HAVE TO MAKE SURE MY KIDS LITERALLY HAVE EXPERIENCES AND I PRWT WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH IT TOO WERE WE ARE ALOST LIKE PURPOSEFULLY MAKING SURE THEY GET ENOUGH OF THAT YOU KNOW SO THEY CAN BUILD DIFFERENT CIRCUITS YES SO MUCH UNPACK THERE I I THINK UM IT'S CLEAR THAT SOME OF THIS IS TIED TO FINANCIAL MEANS UM I THINK IT'S A IT'S A PRETTY SCARY THING WHEN SOME ONE LOOKS OUT ON THE LANDSCAPE THE WORLD AS INFINITE POSSIBILITY UM WITHOUT ANY FRUSTRATION UM AS WE TALCH BUT EARLY R THE ABILITY TO LEAN INTO HARD THINGS AS AS A SKILL THAT CAN EXTEND OTHER THINGS IS IS SO VALUABLE DO YOU THINK THAT SOME OF THE SMALLER PRACTICES THAT ANY KID ANY PARENT ANY FAMILY REGARDLESS OF MEANS CAN LEAN INTO CAN REALLY HTHER LIKE LIKE LIKE UM YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE SAY GRACE OR PRAYER BEFORE MEAL OTHERS SIMPLY EXPRESS GRATITUDE BUT YOU A STOPPING THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW MEAN BEING BREATHING BRING BING AMBULATORY BEING ANY NUMBER OF GOOD THINGS THAT ALLOW US AGENCY IN LIFE UM ABOUT TO FOOD I MEAN THOSE THOSE MOMENTS I I THINK I THINK IR I KNOW THAT OUR A NERVOUS SYSTEM REFLECTS ALNOST YET HOW COULD THEY NOT AND JUST RECOGNIZING THAT IT LEAST SOMETHING WENT INTO THE CREATION OF THE MEAL I THINK FOR LIKE THE ENTITLEMENTS UP ON THE FRUSTRATION LIKE THERE'S ALL THESE SMALL MOMENTS THAT WE CONSTERT TO MAKE AT DIFFERENCE AND I THINK IT'S SANE YOURSELF JUST AS I CAN DOESN'T MEAN I WILL SO LIKE MY KIDS YOUNG AND I PIK THEM UP FROM A PLADY AND I THAT' THEY HAVE A BABIES AT OUT HOME OR MY HUSBAND AT HOME AND IN LIKE I'VE TO GO TO A STORE IN SOME ERRANDS MAYS IT CAN YOU DROP ME OFF FIRST MIG BE I LIKE YOU KNOW I LIKE NO YOU'RE ON TO COME WITH ME ON I'M NOT CAN SAY THIS I ON BORING ERRANDS BECAUSE YOU JUST HAVE TO TOLERATE THAT LIKE SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO DO THINGS YOU DON'T WANT TO DO ON LIKE YOURE NOT IN A LEARN NAP BY ME TELLING MEU THAT YOU REGIN A LEARN TAT BY EXPERIENCING THAT YOU KNOW IT' SOMETHING WITH MY HIADS OUN O THE OTHER DAY WE ARE AT AN AIR PART I'M LIKE THERRE YOU KNW IN THE RPORT LIKE A KIND OF WINES AROUND LIKE TO GET AND THERE'S LIKE NO ONE THERE THEY STARCS LIKE DUCK UNDER ALL THE LIKE THINGS AND JUST MADE ME THINK LIKE AS A SMALL MOMAN LIKE ENTITLEMEN ALSO IS LIKE THE RULES DON'T APPLY TO ME AN SOME MA ONDS LIKE AND I DESMEMBER IT E GIES WHEN WE'RE AN AIR PORT TOS THAT THE THE LINES IT LEADING UP TO SECURITY YE  YOU CANT DOON TAT  YOU LIKE MASS THEM UP AND IT WASN'T LIKE FOR EVER BUT I'LS LIKE YOU AS I THESE THINGS SOME ONE PUT THESE HERE FOR A REASON AND WE'RE JUST CON A IT'S LIKE IKE ITHESE THINGS AFE TOBE SOT SUCH IT'S A SMALL AMOUNT OF FRUSTRATION BUT JUST LIKE I DON'T ALWAYS GET TO DUCK THE LINE SOMETIMES I HAVE TO LIKE WALK A LITTLE LONGER OR I REMEMBER MY KID SAYING AND I'M NOT A MUNE TO THIS LIKE I AM IN A FINANCIAL POSSITION WERE I HAVE SOME ONE COME SOMETIMES HELP ME BE MY HOUSEKEEPER RIGHT AND COLFUL THE LAUNDRY I REMEMBER ON A SUNDAY MY SUN SAID TO ME IN IS YOUNGR I LIKE WHY DO WE'VE TO FOLD THE LAUNDRY KIND OF LIKE I AL THAT YE SAID IT BETEVS KIND OF LIKE DON'T WE HAVE SOME ONE YOU KNOW WHO COULD DO THAT ND I REMEMBER BEING LIKE THIS IS A MOLLMAN RI  WE'RE IN A FOLD THE LAUNDRY ON SUNDAYS YOU KNOW WHO LOVES FOLDING LAUNDRY MAY BE SOME PEOPLE I DON'T I DON'T LOVE ON DOING THE WASER IT IS INHERENTLY NOT THAT ENJOYABLE BUT LIKE AN SUL FRUSTRATING AS JUST LIKE NOT GREAT AND LIKE I KNOW I NEED TO MAKE MY KIDS DO THAT LIKE IT THEY JUST HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT MONDANE THING UM AND SO I THINK THERE'S ALL OF THESE MOMENTS TAKING YO KID WITH YOU ON ERRANDS YOU KNOW DOING THE LONTRE RIHT BEFORE YOU SAY TO YOUR KID LET'S GO TO TRY OUT ON ANOTHER SOCRATYM SLIKE OH YOU DON'T MAKE THE TEAM MAYBE MA BE LET UT GO TWO DAYS THAT'S AT LEAST TWO MORE DAYS OF FEELING UPSET AND FRUSTRATED RIGHT THEY DON'T TO BE THESE BIG GRAND THINGS THAT ALL OF THOSE LITTLE MOMENTS CAN AT UP AND REALLY POSITIVE WAY WHAT'S YOUR STANDS ON HOUSEHOLD CHORES AND SHOULD KIDS BE PAID FOR HOUSEHOLD CHORES UM YES I HAVE A WHOLE GUIDE TO CHORES AND ALLOWANCE AND I ACTUALLY YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF ALLIK HOUL THEY BE SEPARATE KNOW I THINK IT COULD BE DONE EITHER WAY BUT TO ME THE QUESTION FOR PARENT IS LIKE WHAT IS THE POINT FOR ME LIKE WHAT IS MY GOAL FOR CHORS WHAT IS MY GOAL FOR ALLOWANCE RIGHT AND I THINK THAT HAS TO THEN STRUCTURE HOW WE DO IT SO MY GUESSIS FOR CHORES PART OF IT IS I WANT MY KID TO NUBER ONE MAY BE LIKE HELD AROUND THE HOUSE ONET THEM O HAVE THAT PURPOSE ALSO LIKE I KNOW FOR ME FOR CHORES LIK SOMETIMES YOUR LIFE INVOLVES DOING FORING THINGS THAT IS JUST TRUE AND LIKE I WANT MY KIDS TO KNOW THAT WHICH MEANS AVE TO EXPERIENCE THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WE DO CHORES SO FOR ME IF THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I'M NOT IN A PAY MY KID BECAUSE FOR ME IN MY FAMILY WHAT I THINK MY KIDS MEE TO GET OUT OF IT IS JUST LIKE KNOWING THAT SOMETIMES YOU DO BORING THINGS AS PART OF BEING GOOD HUMAN FOR SOME ONE ELSE THAT MIGHT BE TOTALLY DIFFERENT SO I THEY WOU JUST ASK OURSELVES AS PARENS LIKE ONE OF MY TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH AND THEN LET ME STRUCTURE IT AROUND THAT ACROSS THE COURSE OF TODAYS DISCUSSION A IN FEELING BOTH IMMENSE GRATITUDE A AND RELIEF FOR CERTAIN A QUITTINC OR HARDSHIPS THAT I EXPERIENCE AM AND THINGS THAT MY PARENTS MADE ME DO OR WAYS THAT THEY WERE NEGLIGENTS AND I WAS FORCE TO FIGURE THINGS OUT ALSO AM YOU KNOW SOMETHING SO I IS LIKE A LIKE WHISH THEY 'D DONE THIS I THINK EVERY ONE LISTENING TO THIS WILL FEEL THAT WAY AM AND

WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LAPONCAS   SCIENCE SCIENCE FACE TO  FOR I'M INDRUHUBERMEN AND I'M A PROFESSOR OF NEROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTOC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS AT LETIC GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THEREASEN I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GRENS AN THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIGREENS ONCE OR TWICE O DAY IS THAT HELPS ME COVER ALL OF MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGHT HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH OUR VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GOPMICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WITH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSENTIALLY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITHOUT LETIC GREENS IT GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED AND THE PROBIOCS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIOM IF YOU LIKE TO TRY ATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY' GIVE YOU FIV FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THREE K TOO THERE ARE TON OF DAT AND OW SHOWING THAT VITEMEND THREE IS ESSENTIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH EVEN IF FOR GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICIEN IN VITEMEN D THREE AND K TOO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CARVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATHLETI GREN STOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FIFRE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TO TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENTS IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND PATASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR OVE TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLE OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLITES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AND ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOS ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY ND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEMS CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLITES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IF HYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOUR GETTING THE PROPARATIOES OF ELECTROLITES IF YOU' LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMEN T DOK CM SLASH HUBERMEN AND YOU'LL GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THERE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WAN A TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMEN T DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMAN WE ARE NOW BEGINNING A NEW TOPIC FOR THE NEXT FOUR TO FIVE EPISODES OF THE HUBERMAN LABPOTCAST BEFORE WE MOVE IN TO THAT I WANT TO JUST BRIEFLY TOUCH ON A COUPLE QUESTIONS THAT I GOT FROM THE LAST EPISODE WHICH WAS RELATED TO THE SCIENCE OF ENDURANCE TRAINING I DESCRIBE THE FOUR KINDS OF ENDURANCE TRAINING WE POSTED PROTOCALLS OF THE SPECIFIC FOUR KINDS OF ENDURANCE TRAINING AT HUBERMAN LABDOT CALM JUST GO TO THAT EPISODE YOU CAN SEE THE DOWNLOAD IT'S A ZEROCOST PD F I GOT A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT'S CALLED CONCURRANT TRAINING WHICH IS HOW TO PROGRAM IN DURANCE TRAINING IF YOU ARE ALSO INTERESTED IN STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHY TRAINING OR HOW TO INCORPORATE STRAINGTH AND HYPERTROPHY TRAINING WHICH WAS IN THE PREVIOUS EPISODE WITH ENDURANCE TRAINING THIS CAN ALL BE MADE VERY SIMPLE ASK YOURSELF WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO EMPHISIZE AND THEN EMPHASIZE THAT FOR A TEND TO TWELVE WEEK CYCLE SO IF YOURE MOSTLY INTERESTED IN ENDURANCE I WOULD SAY YOUSE A THREE TOTO RATIO MAYBE GET THREE ENDURANCE TRAINING WORKOUTS PER WEEK MAYBE FOR AND TWO STRENGTH AN HYPERTROPHE WORKOUTS IF YOU ARE MAINLY FOCUSSING ON STRENGTH AN HYPERTROPHE GET THREE OR FOUR WORK OUTS FOR STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHE END DO TO ENDURANCE WORKOUTS START WITH THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF SETS THAT'S REQUIRED TO GET THE RESULT THAT YOU WANT SO IF YOUARE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO DOING IN DURANCE WORK YOU WOULD START WITH THE MINIMUM NUMBER THAT'S LISTED ON THAT PROTOCOL SO IF IT SAYS THREE TO FIVE SETS YOU WOULD START WITH THREE MABEVEN JUST TWO AND THEN WORK YOUR WAY UP BY ADDING SETS EACH WEEK I DO SUGGEST THAT PEOPLE GET AT LEAST ONE  COMPLETE RESTAT PER WEEK ON ALTHOUGH I KNOW A LOT PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THAT I BENEFIT FROM THAT ACTUALLY BENEFIT FROM HAVING TWO COMPLETE RESTAYS EACH WEEK I JUST CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS THAT WAY WHETHER NOTS FOR STRAINTH AND HYPERTROPHE OR FOR ENDURANCE I AM A BIG BELIEVER IN RESTAS OTHER PEOPLE OR NOT AND THOSE CON BE ACTIVE RESTAYS HYKING RELAXING ET CETERA AFTER A TEND TO TWELVE WEEK CYCLE THEN I ALSO SUGGEST TAKING ANYWHERE FROM FIVE TO SEVEN DAYS COMPLETELY OFF YOU CAN STILL ENJOY LIFE IN DO THINGS I KNOW FOR YOU ADDICTED EXERCISERS THAT YOU'RE GIN A LOATH TO DO THAT BUT THAT'S ONE WAY TO STAY INJURY FREE KEEP YOUR JOINTS AN TISSUES HEALTHY OVER TIME AND CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT WEEK OFF DON'T DO IT NONE OF THIS IS WHOLLY NONE OF IT IS A STRICT PRESCRIPTIVE JUST ASK YOURSELF WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO EMPHISIZE AND EMPHASIZE THAT IN TERMS OF THE TOTALVOLUME OF WORKOUTS THAT YOU DO AND WORK UP IN CREMENTALLY AND THEN MOVE INTO ANOTHER CYCLE THAT'S WHAT I SUGGEST SO GO TO HUBEMAN LABDOT CALM YOU CAN GET THE PROTOCOL THERE WE ARE NOW GOING TO MOVE INTO A NEW TOPIC UNRELATED TO PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE STARTING WITH THIS EPISODE AND FOR THE NEXT FOUR TO FIVE EPISODES WE ARE GOING TO TALK ALL ABOUT THE SENSES THAT'S SIHTE ISITE HERING TOUCH TASTE SMELL AND WE ARE ALSO GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS CRITICAL SENS THAT WE CALL IN TERROCEPTION OR OUR SENSE OF OUR INTERNAL REAL ESTATE NOW THE REASON THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SENSES IS BECAUSE IF YOU UNDERSTAND HOW THE SENSES ARE PERCEIVED WHAT THERE ABOUT WHAT THE UNDERLYING CELLS AND CONNECTIONS ARE ABOUT YOU WILL BE IN A TERRIFIC POSITION TO UNDERSTAND THE MONTHS TOPIC THAT FOLLOWS WHICH IS ALL ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH NOW I WANT O EMPHISIZE THAT IF YOURE SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE SEEING HEARING TASTING SMELLING AND HAS AN EXCELLENT SENSE OF INTERROCEPTION I DO BELIEVE THAT THESE EPISODES WILL STILL BE VERY RELEVANT TO YOU BECAUSE THEY HAVE EVERYTHING TO DO WITH HOW YOU MOVE THROUGH THE WORLD HOW YOU MAKE SENSE OF INFORMATION AND HOW YOU ORGANIZE YOUR THOUGHTS IN YOUR EMOTIONS I ALSO WONE TO EMPHISIZE THAT WEARE GOING TO COVER A LOT OF PRACTICAL TOOLS SO TO DAY'S EPISODE IS GOING TO BE ALL ABOUT VISION AND EYESIGHT A TOPIC THAT'S VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART BECAUSE IT'S THE ONE THAT I'VE BEEN FOCUSSING ON FOR WELL OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF MY CAREER BUT WE'RE NOT JUST GOING TO GET INTO THE MECHANISTIC DETAILS ABOUT HOW LIGHT IS CONCONVERTED INTO ELECTRICAL POTENTIALS AND THINGS LIKE THAT WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT PRACTICAL TOOLS THAT YOU CAN AND SHOULD USE TO HELP MAINTAIN THE HEALTH OF YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM AND YOUR EYESIGHT VERY OFTEN YOUNG PEOPLE WILL SAY WHAT SHOULD I DO YOU KNOW YOU ARE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW NERL PLASTICITY AND HOW IT TAPERS OFF OVER TIME BUT I'M A YOUNG PERSON WHAT SHOULD I DO YOU SHOULD ABSOLUTELY TRAIN AND SUPPORT YOUR EYESIGHT IN FACT IF YOUARE A YOUNG PERSON AND YOU SEE PERFECTLY OR YOU FEEL AS IF YOU SEE THE WORLD PERFECTLY YOU ARE IN THE BEST POSITION TO BOLSTER TO REENFORCE THAT VISUAL SYSTEM SO THAT YOU DON'T LOSE YOUR VISION AS YOU AGE IN ADDITION YOU CAN LEVERGE YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM FOR BETTER MENTAL AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE AND OREGAN TO TALK ABOUT THAT IF YOUR SOMEBODY WHO SUFFERS FROM A CLINICAL DISORDER OF VISION YOU HAVE TROUBLE SEEING OR IF YOU NEED CORRECTIVE LENSES IN ORDER TO SEE THIS EPISODE IS DEFINITELY FOR YOU AND WHILE OF COURSE I CAN'T MAKE CLINICAL DIAGNOSES CAN'T HAVE A ONE ONE CONVERSATION WITH ANY OF YOU IN THIS FORMAT NOR AM I A CLINITION ON A SCIENTIST NOT OF PHYSICIAN I DID CONSULT WITH OUR CHAIR ABOUT THEMOLOGY DOCTOR JEFFREY GOLBERG AT STAMFORD UNIVERSY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AS WELL SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE TO REALLY VET THE INFORMATION AND MAKE SURE THAT THE PROTOCALS THAT I'M DESCRIBING ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE CLINICAL LITERATURE IF YOU HAVE A SEVERE EYE PROBLEM YOU SHOULD BE WORKING WITH A REALLY GOOD OPTHEMOLOGIST AND OR OPTOMETRIST BUT CERTAINLY AN AN OPTHEMOLOGIST WHO IS A MEDICAL DOCTOR BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THE INFORMATION THAT WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS TODAY AS GOING TO BE RELEVANT TO EVERYBODY AND WILL SET THE STAGE FOR THE MONTH ON MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL PERFORMANCE SO LET'S GET STARTED WHEN WE HEAR THE WORD VISION WE MOST OFTEN THINK ABOUT EYESIGHT OR OUR ABILITY TO PERCEIVE SHAPES AND OBJECTS AND FACES AND COLORS AND INDEED VISION INVOLVES EESIGHT OUR ABILITY TO SEE SHAPES AND OBJECTS AND FACES AND COLORS AND SO FORTH HOWEVER OUR EYES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MUCH MORE THAN THAT INCLUDING OUR MOOD ARE LEVEL OF ALERTNESS AND OLL OF THAT IS INCLUDED IN WHAT WE CALL VISION SO I JUST WANE TO TAKE ABOUT THREE MAYBE FOUR MINUTES AND TALK ABOUT HOW THE VISUAL SYSTEM WORKS HOW IT'S BUILT AND HOW YOU ARE ABLE TO SO CALLED SEE THINGS AROUND YOU I ALSO WANT TO DESCRIBE THE WAYS IN WHICH YOUR EYES AND YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM IMPACT YOUR MOOD AND YOUR LEVEL OF ALERTNESS AND THEN WE ARE GOING TO GET RIGHT INTO SOME PROTOCAL SOME SPECIFIC THINGS THAT EACH IN ALL OF YOU SHOULD DO IF YOU WANT TO ENHANCE YOUR VISION AND MAINTAIN YOUR VISION AS YOU GET OLDER AND AGAIN IF YOU ARE A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD OR A TWELVE YEAR OLD THIS EPISODE IS ESPECIALLY FOR YOU BECAUSE YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IS FAR MORE PLASTIC THAN MINE IS IT'S MUCH MORE AMENTABLE TO CHANGE SO YOU CAN REALLY BUILD A VERY STRONG VISUAL SYSTEM AND IN DOING THAT AND IF YOU ADOPT SPECIFIC BEHAVIORS AT ANY AGE OF LIGHT VIEWING AT PARTICULAR TIMES IN PARTICULAR WAYS THEN YOU CAN BUILD AND EMOTIONAL SYSTEM THAT'S ALSO REINFORCED BY YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM SO LET'S TALK ABOUT VISION WHAT IS VISION WELL VISION STARTS WITH THE EYES WE HAVE KNOW WHAT'S CALLED EXTRA OCULAR LIGHT PERCEPTION WHILE IT FEELS GOOD DEVELIGHT ON OUR SKIN WHILE FEELS GOOD TO BE OUTSIDE IN THE SUNLIGHT FOR MOST PEOPLE THE ONLY WAY THAT LIGHT INFORMATION CAN GET TO THE CELLS OF YOUR BODY IS THROUGH THESE TWO LITTLE GOODIES ON THE FRONT OF YOUR FACE AND FOR THOSE OF YOU LISTENING OM JUST POINTING TO MY EYES AS MANY OF YOU HAVE HEARD ME SAY BEFORE ON THIS ANOTHER PODCAST YOUR EYES IN PARTICULAR YOUR NURL RETINAS ARE PART OF YOUR CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM THEY ARE PART OF YOUR BRAIN THERE ARE THE ONLY PART OF YOUR BRAIN THAT SITS OUTSIDE THE CRANIAL VOULT ANOTHER WORDS YOU HAVE TWO PIECES OF YOUR BRAIN THAT DELIBERATELY GOT SQUEEZED OUT OF THE SKULL DURING DEVELOPMENT AND PLACED IN THESE THINGS WE CALL EYESOCKETS THERE'S A GUNETIC PROGRAM FOR THE SPECIFIC PURPOSE OF MAKING SURE THAT THREE LITTLE LAYERS OF NURON'S NERVE CELLS GOT SQUEEZED OUT AND FORM WHAT ARE CALL YOUR NERL RETNAS NOW THE EYES HAVE A LOT OF OTHER GOODIES IN THEM THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND THOSE OTHER GOODIES THAT WERE GOING TO FOCUS ON A A LOT TO DAY THERE'S A LENDS TO FOCUS LIGHT PRECISELY TO THE RETINA IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO REQUIRES EYEGLASSES OR CONTACTS CHANCES ARE YOU DON'T DO THAT CORRECTLY AND THAT'S WHY YOU USE OTHER LENSES LIKE EYEGLASSES OR CONTACTS THERE RE ALSO OTHER PIECES OF THE EYE THAT ARE DESIGNE TO KEEP THE EYE LUBRICATED YOU ALSO HAVE THESE THINGS THAT WE CALL EYELASHES MOST PEOPLE KNOW THIS BUT EYELASHES ARE THERE TO TRIGGER THE BLINK REFLECTS IF A PIECE OF DUST OR SOMETHING GETS IN FRONT OF YOUR EYE IT'S A BEAUTIFUL ADAPTATION OF NATURE THERE AREN'T JUST AESTHETICALLY NICE COSTELLO HAPPINS TO HAVE VERY LONG EYELASHES HE GETS COMPLEMENTS ABOUT THIS ALL THE TIME MAYBE YOU HAVE LONG EYELASHES I DON'T HAVE PARTICULARLY LONG EYELASHES BUT THE EYELASHES ARE THERE SO THAT IF A PIECE OF DUST OR SOMETHING STARTS TO HEAD TOWARDS THE CORNY O THE EYE BLINKS VERY VERY FAST ITS THE FASTEST REFLECTS YOU OWN IS YOUR E BLINK REFLEX WE ALSO HAVE THESE THINGS CALLED EYE LIDS NOW EYELIDS MIGHT SEEM LIKE THE MOST BORING TOPIC OF ALL BUT THEY ARE INCREDIBLY FASCINATING TO DAY WEREGON TO TALK ABOUT HOW YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM TO INCREASE YOUR LEVELS OF ALERTNESS BASED ON THE NURL CIRCUITS THAT LINK YOUR BRAIN STEM WITH YOUR EYELIDS AND NOW WE ARE NOT GON TO HAVE A BLINKING CONTESTS BECAUSE I WOULD WIN AND YOU WOULD LOOSE AND THAT WHEN BE FUN FOR YOU SO LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT THE EYES DO FOR VISION BASICALLY THE ENTIRE JOB OF THE EYES IS TO COLLECT LIGHT INFORMATION AND SEND IT OFF TO THE REST OF THE BRAIN IN A FORM THAT THE BRAIN CAN UNDERSTAND REMEMBER NO LIGHT ACTUALLY GETS IN PASS THOSE NURLRETNAS IT GETS TO THE NURLRETNA AND WE HAVE SPECIFIC CELLS IN THE EYE CALLED PHOTORECEPTORS THEY COME IN TWO DIFFERENT TYPES RODS AND CONES CONES ARE MAINLY RESPONSIBLE FOR DAYTIME VISION AND THE RODS ARE MAINLY RESPONSIBLE FOR VISION AT NIGHT OR UNDER LOWLIGHT CONDITIONS GENERALLY SPEAKING SO BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS IF YOUR EYELIDS ARE OPEN LIGHT COMES INTO THE EYE THE LENDS FOCUSES THAT LIGHT LIGHT IS ALSO JUST CALLED PHOTONS LIGHT ENERGY ON TO THE RETINA THESE PHOTORECEPTORS THE RODS AND CONES HAVE CHEMICAL REACTIONS INSIDE THEM THAT INVOLVE THINGS LIKE VITEM IN AY AND THAT CHEMICAL REACTION CONVERTS THE LIGHT INTO ELECTRICITY NOW THAT MIGHT SEEM INCREDIBLY ABSTRACT BUT THE WAY TO THNK ABOUT THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO FOR INSTANCE YOU HAVE TOUCH RECEPTORS ON YOUR SKIN AND WHEN YOU PRESS ON THOSE TOUCH RECEPTORS THEY CONVERT PRESSURE PHYSICAL PRESSURE INTO ELECTRICAL INFORMATION AN THOSE NURONS SEND IT UP TO YOUR SPINAL COURTIN BRAINIA CAN REGISTER THE SOMEBODY OR YOU ARE TOUCHING YOURE THE TOP YOUR HAND AS I'M DOING NOW WITH THE EYES AND THE RETINA IS JUST THAT LIGHT GETS CONVERTED INTO ELECTRICAL INFORMATION WITHIN THE EYE WITHIN THE RETINA THEYRE THEN A A SERIES OF STAGES OF PROCESSING AND THAT INFORMATION OFVENTIN GETS SEND INTO THE BRAIN BY A VERY SPECIFIC CLASS OF NURONS I WOULD LIKEYOU TO KNOW THE NAMES OF THESE NURONS THEY'RE CALLED RETINAL GANGLEAN CELLS SO THE ONLY THING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE NURW SCIENCE OF THE EYE AT THIS POINT ARE THAT THEIR RODS AND CONES THE CONES ARE INVOLVED IN BRIGHT DAYTIME VISION AND RODS ARE INVOLVED IM WORE DUSK OR NIGHT TIME VISION AND YOU GOT THE SELLS CALLED RETNAL GANGLIN CELLS THAT SEND THE INFORMATION OFF TO THE REST OF THE BRAIN NOW HERE'S WHAT'S INCREDIBLE AND SWEN YOU TO PONDER THIS FOR A SECOND THE STILL BLOWS MY MIND EVERYTHING YOU SEE AROUND YOU YOUARE NOT ACTUALLY SEEING THOSE OBJECTS DIRECTLY WHAT YOUR DOING IS YOURE MAKING A BEST GUESS ABOUT WHAT'S THERE BASED ON THE PATTERN OF ELECTRICITY THAT DERIVES IN YOUR GRAEN NOW THAT MIGHT JUST SEEM TOTALLY WILD AND HARD TO RAP YOUR HEAD AROUND BUT THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY BECAUSE THIS IS THE WAY IT ACTUALLY WORKS LET'S TAKE IT IN EXAMPLE OF A COLOR LIKE GREEN OR BLUE YOU HAVE CONES IN YOUR EYE THAT RESPOND BEST TO THE WAVE LENGTH OF LIGHT THAT IS REFLECTED OFF SAY A GREEN APPLE SO YOU DON'T ACTUALLY SEE THE GREEN APPLE WHAT YOU SEE IS THE LIGHT BOUNCING OFF THAT GREEN APPLE AND IT GOES INTO YOUR EYE AND YOU SEE IT AND PERSEIVE IT AS ROUND AND GREEN BUT NOT BECAUSE YOU SEE ANYTHING GREEN NO GREEN LIGHT ARRIVES IN YOUR BRAIN WHAT A HAPPENS IS YOUR BRAIN ACTUALLY COMPARES THE AMOUNT OF GREEN REFLECTION COMING OFF THAT APPLE TO THE AMOUNT OF RED AND BLUE AROUND IT WELL YOU MIGHT SAY WHILE THE GREEN APPLES SITTING ON A BROUN TABLE OR A WHITE SURFACE WELL THEN IT WILL APPEAR VERY GREEN BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF WAVE LENGTH OF LIGHT FOR GREEN IS VERY HIYE AND THE AMOUNT FOR RED IS VERY LOW AND SO IT LOOKS VERY GREEN OCE SO WE DON'T ACTUALLY SEE ANYTHING DIRECTLY WHAT THE BRAIN IS RESEIVING IS A SERIES OF SIGNALS ELECTRICAL SIGNALS AND IT'S COMPARING ELECTRICAL SIGNALS IN ORDER TO COME UP WITH WHAT WE CALL THESE PERCEPTIONS LIKE I SEE SOMETHING GREEN A GREEN APPLE OR I SEE RED LET ME GIVE YOU A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT EXAMPLE IF YOU WERE TO PLAY A KEY ON THE PIANO LET' SAY YOU PLAY ANOT A MUSICIAN BUT OMINENTS O HOPEFULLY I WON'T GET THIS TOO A TO INCORRECTLY BUT LET SAY YOU YOU HAVE LIKE E SHARP MAYBE IT'S UNTINTINTINTINTING IF THE BRAIN GETS THAT SIGNAL IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY NOW E THAT'S WHAT IT DOESN'T RECOGNIZE IT UNTIL YOU WERE TO PLAY I ANOTHER KEY NEXTO IT DNDUNDUNDUNDUN AND WHAT IT DOES IS DOES THE MATH IT DOES THE SUBTRACTION AND IT COMPARES THOSE TWO SO WHEN WE SEE SOMETHING GREEN OR WE SEE SOMETHING RED OR WE SEE SOMETHING BLUE WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY SEEING IT DIRECTLY THE GRAIN IS MAKING A GUESS ABOUT HOW GREEN OR RED OR BLUE THAT THING IS BY COMPARING WHAT'S AROUND IT O AND IF THAT SEEMS HARD TO WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND DON'T WORRY BECAUSE WE WILL EXPLAIN IT IN MORE DEPTH GOING FORWARD BUT I REALLY WANT PEOPLE TO NDERSTAND THIS THAT VISION EY SIGHT IS NOT LOOKING AT THINGS DIRECTLY AND THAT INFORMATION GETTING DIRECTLY INTO YOUR BRAIN IT IS TRANSLATED LIGHT INFORMATION IS TRANSFORMED INTO ELECTRICAL SIGNALS THAT YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM EXQUISITELY UNDERSTANDS NOW WHAT DOES THIS MEEN WHY SHOULD YOU CARE ABOUT THIS WELL IF YOU HAVE A DOG LIKE I DO OR A CAT THEY ARE NOT COLOR BLIND BUT THEY LACK THE THE CONES THAT RESPOND TO RED MEANING LONG WAVE LENGTH LIGHT SO WHAT DOES THAT MEEN THAT MEANS THAT WHEN THEY SEE GREEN IT'S DIFFERENT THAN THE GREEN YOU SEE NOT BECAUSE THAT APPLE ISN'T VISIBLE TO THEM BUT BECAUSE THEY AREN'T ABLE TO COMPARE IT TO RED AND YOU ARE AS A CONSEQUENCE WHEN THEY LOOK AT A GREEN LAWN IT LOOKS MORE BROWNISH OR ORANGE TO THEM WHEN YOU ARE A RED SHIRT IN FRONT OF YOUR DOG OR CAT IF YOU SEE A STOPSINE AND THEY SEE A STOPSINE THEY SEE ORANGISH BROWN AND YOU SEE RED PRESUMING THAT YOU ARE A TRYCROMAT MENING YOU HAVE THREE COLOR VISION SO THIS IS ALL TO SAY THAT EVERY ANIMAL SEES THE WORLD DIFFERENTLY DEPENDING ON WHEATHER OR NOT THEY HAVE ONE OR TWO OR THREE OF THESE DIFFERENT CONES THE RED BLUE OR GREEN CONES IF YOU ARE A MANTISH SHRIMP OF ALL THINGS YOU SEE HUNDREDS OF COLORS THAT HUMAN BEINGS CAN'T SEE MANY ANIMALS SEE INTO VISUAL RANGES THAT YOU AND I CAN'T SEE AND SO FOR INSTANCE A PIT VIPER SENSES HEAT IMISSIONS IT LITERALLY SEES THAT HEAT COMING OFF OF YOU OR OF AN ANIMAL THAT THEY WANT TO EAT IF YOU ARE A GROUND SQUIRREL YOU CAN SEE ULTRA VIOLET LIGHT THES GIN SOUND KIND A WEIRD BUT GROUND SQUIRRELS AS HLY SIGNAL ONE ANOTHER BY STANDING UP OUTSIDE AND SHINING SUNLIGHT OFF EACH OTHERS STOMACHS TO EACH OTHER SIGNALLING AT A DISTANCE JUST LIKE YOU KNOW YOU COULD SIGNAL SOMEBODY WITH A MIRROR IN SUNLIGHT AT DISTANCE THERE ARE SPECIES OF PRIMATES THIS ISN'T VERY PLEASANT A THING ABOUT THAT URINATE ON THEIR HANDS AND THEN WIPE IT ALL OVER THEIR STOMACH AND THEN YUSE THAT SUNLIGHT TO REFLECT DIFFERENT SIGNALS TO EACH OTHER ONO WAT THEIR SAYING WE ALWAYS ASSUME AT SOMETHING CUTE AND NICE BUT MAY BE THEIR INSULTING EACH OTHER SO THIS ACTUALLY GETS RIGHT DOWN TO THE HEART OF THESE BIGGER QUESTIONS LIKE CONSCIOUSNESS WHAT WE SEE WHAT'S OUT THERE HOW MUCH OF LIFE IS REALLY ACCESSIBLE TO US AND I COUN GO ON AND ON YOU KNOW THIS USED TO BE AND AF AN OBSESSION OF MINE WHEN I WAS COMING UP IN THE FIELD OF VISUAL NARROWSCIENCE TO UNDERSTAND HOW DIFFERENT ANIMAL SEE THE WORLD COMPARED TO US NOWLL GIVE ONE MORE EXAMPL A DIVING BIRD YOU KNOW A BIRD THAT FLIES OVER THE OCEAN IT HAS AN INCREDIBLE TASK IT HAS TO BOTH VIEW THE HORIZON AND HAS TO VIEU SCHOOLS OF FISH AND THEN HAS TO MAKE A TRAJECTORY DOWN INTO THE WATER AND GRAB ONE OF THOSE FISH TO EAT AND THE WATER HAS WHAT'S CALLED A REFRACTORY INDECS IT ACTUALLY SHIFTS LIKE A PRISM THE IMPRESSION OR THE PERCEPTION OF WHERE THAT FISH IS RIGHT IF THE BIRD SEES THE FISH RIGHT BELOW IT IT HAS TO KNOW IT HAS TO ADJUST ITS DIVINTRAJECTORY JUST RIGHT BECAUSE IT KNOWS THAT THAT FISH ACTUALLY ISN'T WHERE IT SEES IT ITS PROBABLY A FEW INCHES AHEAD OR TO THE SIDE OF THAT BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT WATER DIVERTS THE IMAGE IFYOU'VE EVER DROPPED A COIN TO THE BOTTOM OF A POOL IF YOU GO STRAIGHT DOWN LOOKING AT THAT LOCATION IF YOU WERE LOOK FROM THE TOP OF THE POOL AND YOU DIVE STRAIGHT DOWN WITH YOUR EYES CLOSE YOU WILL MISS BECAUSE THE WATER REFRACTS IT SHIFTS THE VISUAL IMAGE WELL DIVING BIRDS HAVE AN ARRANGEMENT OF THESE RETINAL CELLS THAT COMMUN NICATE TO THE BRAIN THAT'S BOTH A STREAK TO VIEW THE HORIZON CAUSE THEY NEED TO KNOW WHERE THEY ARE RELATIVE TO TE ORIZON AND THEY HAVE A PUPIL LIKE WE DO ON THE BOTTOM OF THEIR EYE SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE VERY ACCURATE DIVE AND ATTACKS ON THESE SCHOOLS OF FISH AND CATCH FISH AND EAT THOSE FISH WE JUST HAVE PUPILS IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR EYES SO THERE'S A TON ABOUT THE OPTICTS OF THE EYE IN THE WAY THAT IT COMMUNICATES WITH THE BRAIN THAT ALLOWS US TO SEE WE COULD SPEND HOURS TALKING ABOUT THIS BUT WHAT I'D LIKE TO BED IN YOUR MIND IS THAT WHAT YOU EXPERIENCE IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD IS BOTTLE NECKED IT'S LIMITED BY WHICH WAVE LENGTHS WHICH COLORS IF YOU WILL OF LIGHT THAT YOU CAN SEE THAT YOUR BRAIN IS COMING UP WITH THE BEST GUESS ABOUT WHAT'S THERE IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT'S THERE AND THAT YOUR VISION IS DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT FROML SAY THE VISION OF A DOG OR FROM THE VISION OF SOMEBODY WHOSE A DYCROMAT MEANING THEY DON'T HAVE A RED CONE A LOT OF PEOPIL IN PARTICULAR ABOUT ONE IN EIGHTY MAILS LACKS A RED CONE AND THEREFORE SEES TE WORLD MUCH THE SAME WAY THAT COSTELLO DOES ALTHOUGH HE SEES IT FROM JUST MUCH LOWER TOWARD THE GROUND SO THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE YOU TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE WAY THE EYE COMMUNICATES WITH THE BRAIN I WOULD ALSO LIKE YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE BRAIN ITSELF IS MAKING THESE GUESSES AND THAT THOSE GUESSES ARE LARGELY RIGHT HOW DO I KNOW THAT WELL THE RIGHT BECAUSE WHEN YOU REACH OUT TO GRAB A GLASS MOST OF THE TIME YOU GRAB TH GLASS AND YOU DON'T MISS RIGHT MOST OF THE TIME WHEN YOU MAKE JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE WORLD AROUND YOU BASED ON YOUR VISUAL IMPRESSION OF THEM IT ALLOWS YOU TO MOVE FUNCTIONALLY THROUGH THE WORLD BUT LET ME GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES OF WHERE THIS GUESSING IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AND ITS SO INCREDIBLE THAT TO THIS DAY THAS STILL BLOWS MY MIND COVER ONE EYE WITH ONE HAND AS IF YOUR DRIVING MAYBE DON'T DO THIS IF YOUR VIEWING THE WORLD AROUND YOU PRESUMABLY YOU CAN SEE EVERYTHING THAT'S OUT THERE I COULD DO THIS WITH ONE EYE OR THE OTHER EYE YOU PROBABLY SEE BETTER OUT OF ONE OR THE OTHERAND WILL TALK ABOUT THAT YOU HAVE A GIANT BLIND SPOT IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR VISUAL FIELD IT'S CALLED YOUR BLIND SPOT IT IS THE SPOT IN WHICH THE CONNECTIONS THE WIRES FROM ALL THOSE RETINAL GANGLINGS TELLS EGS AT THE BACK OF THE EYE AND HEAD OFF TOWARD THE BRAIN IN OTHER WORDS YOU ARE BLIND FOR A HUGE SPOT OF YOUR CENTRAL VISION THE PART OF YOUR VISION THAT'S HIGHEST ACUITY HIGHEST DETAIL AND YET YOU DON'T SEE THAT EVER YOU COVER ONE EYE YOU SEE PERFECTLY FINE AND IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE YOUR EYE IS MOVING ROUND REALLY QUICKLY YOUR BRAIN IS GUESSING WHAT'S IN THAT SPOT WHICH IS ABSOLUTE INCREDIBLE AND SO YOU DON'T SEE THAT BLIND SPOT THIS IS HAPPENING ALL THE TIME NOW WHEN YOU HAVE TWO EYES OPEN THE WAY THAT YOUR EYES ARE POSITIONED IN YOUR HEAD AND THE WAY THEY YOU THE WORLD IS SUCH THAT THEY FILL IN EACH OTHER'S BLIND SPOT SA'S PRETTY CONVENIENT BUT IF YOU COVER ONE E THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE AND YET YOU STILL SEE THE WORLD AS COMPLETE SO THE BRAIN IS DOING THESE INCREDIBLE THINGS IT'S ALSO CREATING DEPTH E SENSE OF DEPTH EVEN THOUGH WHAT ARRIVES FROM THE RETNA IS ESSENTIALLY A READ OUT OF A TWO DIMENSIONAL FLAT IMAGE SO CONCENSE DEPTH HOW DO YOU KNOW DEPTH WELL THIS IS VERY SIMPLE THINGS THAT ARE CLOSER T YOU TEND TO BE LARGER THAN THINGS THAT ARE FAR AWAY THINGS THAT ARE CLOSER TO YOU TEND TO LOOK LIKE THEIR MOVING FASTER IF YOU EVER BEEN IN TRAIN AND YOU LOOK TO YOUR SIDE THIS THE RUNGS ON OFFENSE OR THE TRAIN TRACTS GOING BY YOU LOOK LIKETHEYIR GOING VERY FAST IF YU LOOK OFF IN THE DISTANCE THEY LOOK LIKE THEIR MOVING VERY SLOWLY AND THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WHAT'S CLOSE TO YOU IND WHAT'S FURTHER AWAY SO A LITTLE HOUSE ON THE HORIZON YOU DON'T LOOK AT AN SAY OH THAT MUST BE A TINY LITTLE HOUSE YOU HAVE SOME PRIOR KNOWLEDGE THAT THINGS FURTHER AWAY ARE SMALLER STHAT'S THE MAIN WAY THAT YOU DO THAT AND YOU COMPARE THE LOCATION AT WHICH INFORMATION ABOUT LIGHT LANDS ON THE TWO EYES SO YOUR EYES ARE SLIGHTLY OFFSET FROM ONE ANOTHER SO THAT FOR INSTANCE IF I LOOK AT YOU IF YOU ARE STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME RIGHT NOW AND I WERE TO LOOK AT YOU THE IMAGE OF YOUR FACE THE LIGHT BOUNCING OFF YOUR FACE TO BE MORSE PRECISE LANDS ON ONE EYE AND A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT LOCATION THAN IT DOES IN THE OTHER EYE AND THEN THE BRAIN DOES MATH IT BASICALLY DOES THE EQUIVALENT OF GEOMETRY AND TRIGONOMETRY AND ESSENTIALLY FIGURES OUT HOW FAR AWAY YOU ARE FROM ME WHICH IS JUST INCREDIBLE SO THE BRAIN DOES ALL THIS VERY VERY FAST AND THE BRAIN USES ABOUT FORTY TO FIFTY PER CENT OF ITS TOTAL REAL ESTATE FOR VISION THAT'S HOW IMPORTANT VISION IS NOW FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE BLIND OR LOW VISION OR NO VISION THAT MET REAL ESTATE IN THE BRAIN WILL BE TAKEN OVER BY NURANS THAT CONTROL SENSE OF TOUCH AND THE SENSE OF HEARING AND YOUR INDEED HEARING AND TOUCH ARE MUCH BETTER HIGHER ACUITY AND FASTER IN BLIND PEOPLE BUT FOR MOST OF YOU WHO I PRESUME OUR SIGHTED THIS IS HOW IT WORKS SO THAT'S KIND OF VISION FROM EYE TO BRAIN IN A NUTSHELL THERE AR BUNCH OF DIFERENT STATIONS IN THE BRAIN THAT YOU DIFFEREN THINGS THAT'S EYESIGHT NOW I WANT A TALK ABOUT THE OTHER ASPECT OF VISION WHICH IS THE STUFF THAT YOU DON'T PERCEIVE THE SUBCONSCIOUS STUFF AND THEN WILL TRANSITION DIRECTLY INTO HOW YOU CAN USE LIGHT AND EYESIGHT TO CONTROL THIS OTHER STUFF BECAUSE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT IN THAT OTHER STUFF IS MOOD SLEEP AND APPETIT AND THERE ARE WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN USE THE SAME PROTOCOLS THAT I WILL DESCRIBE IN ORDER TO PRESERVE AND EVEN ENHANCS YOUR VISION YOUR ABILITY TO SEE THINGS AND CONSCIOUSLY PERCEIVE THEM SO THE PROTOCOLS WE WILL DESCRIBE HOW A LOT OF CARRY OVER TO BOTH CONSCIOUS EYE SIGHT AND TO THESE SUBCONSCIOUS ASPECTS OF VISION AND I JUST WANT YOU UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE SCIENCE OF SEEN OF EYESIGHT AND VISION AND THEN ALL THE PROTOCOLS WILL MAKE PERFECT SENSE SO AS AMAZING AS EYESIGHT IS IT ACTUALLY DID NOT EVOLVE FOR US TO SEE SHAPES AND COLORS AND MOTION AND FORM THE MOST ANCIENT CELLS IN OUR EYES AND THE REASON WE HAVE EYES IS TO COMMUNICATE INFORMATION ABOUT TIME OF DAY TO THE REST OF THE BRAIN AND BODY REMEMBER THERE'S NO EXTROCULARPHOTORECEPTION THERE'S NO WAY FOR LIGHT INFORMATION TO GET TO ALL THE CELLS OF YOUR BODY BUT EVERY CELL IN YOUR BODY NEEDS TO KNOW IF ITS NIGHT OR DAY I TALKE TO LITTLE ABOUT THIS ON THE IN THE EPISODES ON SLEEP AND THIS EPISODE IS NOT ABOUT SLEEP BUT I WANT TO EMPHISIZE THAT THERE IS A PARTICULAR CATEGORY OF RETINAL GANGLIN CELL REMEMBER THE NURONS THAT CONNECT THE RETNA TO THE BRAIN THAT IS INVOLVED IN A SPECIAL KIND OF VISION THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH CONSCIOUS PERCEPTION OF WHAT'S AROUND YOU AND IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IT'S HAPPENING ALL THE TIME THESE ARE SO CALLED MELONOPSEN RETINAL GANGLIN ELLS NAMED AFTER THE OPSEN THAT THEY CONTAIN WITHIN THEM THEY ARE ESSENTIALLY PHOTORECEPTORS REMEMBER BEFORE I SAID THEIR PHOTORECEPTORS AND THEN THESE GANGLING CELLS WHILE THESE MELONOPSEN CELLS AS THE NAME SUGGESTS MELON OPSEN HAVE THEIR OWN PHOTORECEPTOR BUILT INSIDE THEM THE OPSEN THAT THEY CONTAIN IS ACTUALLY VERY SIMILAR TO THE MELONOPSEN THAT IS PRESENT IN THE SKIN OF SOME AMPHIBIANS AND THAT CAUSES THOSE AMPHIBIANS TO CHANGE THEIR SKIN COLOR IN DIFFERENT LIGHT CONDITIONS SO YOU HAVE BELIEVE IT OR NOT A LITTLE BIT OF FROG SKIN IN YOUR EYE SO TO SPEAK NOT EXACTLY BUT YOU ESSENTIALLY HAVE THE EQUIVALENT OF WHAT FROGS HAVE IN THEIR SKIN IN YOUR YE TIF YOU ARE LOW VISION OR NO VISION AS LONG AS YOU HAVE RETINAS IT'S VERY LIKELY YOU STILL HAVE THESE CELLS EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN'T SEE OR YOU DON'T SEE WELL THESE CELLS RETINAL GANGLIN CELLS COMMUNICATE TO AREAS OF THE BRAIN WHEN PARTICULAR QUALITIES OF LIGHT ARE PRESENT IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT AND SIGNAL TO THE BRAIN THEREFORE THAT IT'S EARLY DAY OR LATE IN THE DAY THESE MELONOPS AND GANGLIN SELLS ARE SOMETIMES ALSO CALLED INTRINSICALLY PHOTOSENSITIVE CELLS BECAUSE THEY BEHAVE LIKE PHOTRECEPTORS WHAT DO THESE CELLS RESPOND TO AND WHY SHOULD YOU CARE ABOUT THEM WELL YOU SHOULD CARE ABOUT THEM BECAUSE THEY REGULATE WHEN YOU'LL GET SLEEPY WHEN YOU'LL FEEL AWAKE HOW FAST YOUR METABOLEM METABOLISM IS SCUSE ME YOUR BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS YOUR DOPOMINE LEVELS AND YOUR PAIN THRESHOLD THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS THAT IMPACT THOSE THINGS BUT THEY ARE ONE OF THE IF NOT THE MOST POWERFUL DETERMINANT OF THOSE OTHER THINGS LIKE MOOD AND PAIN THRESHOLD SLEEPINESS WAKEFULNESS ET CETERA THESE MELONOPSAND GANGLING CELLS HAVE BEEN SHOWN BEYE THE NIGHTS GROUP AND E EYE TEASY UP THE UNIVERSEE WASHINGTON AND BY SIMMERTARS LABINDA IT BURSTEN'S LAB AN NA NUMBER OF OTHER PEOPLE'S LAVE SUCH IN PANDA YOU PREVENTS YOU ET CETERA NUMBER OF EXCELLENT LABS IN YOUR SCIENCE TO SET THE CIRCADEAN CLOCK AND A RESPOND BEST TO THE CONTRAST BETWEEN BLUE AND YELLOW LIGHT OF THE SORT THAT LANDS ON THESE CELLS WHEN YOU VIEW THE SUN WHEN IT'S AT SO CALL LOW SOLAR ANGLE WHEN IT'S LOW IN THE SKY EITHER IN THE MORNING OR IN THE EVENING WHAT IS ALL THIS MEAN IT MEANS AND HEARS THE FIRST PROTOCOL AND YOU'E PROBABLY HEARD ME SAY THIS BEFORE BUT IS APPROPRIATE TO THIS EPISODE TO SAY IT AGAIN IF YOU ARE NOT VIEWING THE SUN SUNLIGHT EVEN THROUGH CLOUD COVER FOR TWO TO TEN MINUTES IN THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY WHEN THE SUN IS STILL LOW IN THE SKY AND DOING THE SAME THING AGAIN IN THE EVENING YOU ARE SEVERELY DISRUPTING YOUR SLEEP RHYTHMS YOUR MOOD YOUR HORMONS YOUR METABOLISM YOUR PAN THRESHOLD AND MANY OTHER FACTORS INCLUDING YOUR ABILITY TO LEARN AND REMEMBER INFORMATION THE MOST SENTRAL AND IMPORTANT ASPECT OF OUR BIOLOGY AND PERHAPS OUR PSYCHOLOGY AS WELL IS TO ANCHOR OUR CELLS IN TIME TO KNOW WHEN WE EXIST OCAIT SOUNDS ALO BIT ABSTRACT AND PHILOSOPHICAL BUT IT'S NOT AND WE DON'T KNOW TIME AS THE REAL THING BECAUSE A WATCHES IN CLOCKS WE KNOW TIME AT A BIOLOGICAL LEVEL BASED ON WHERE THE SUN IS AND WHERE WHICH OF COURSE IS WHERE WE ARE RELATIVE TO THE SUN BECAUSE THE EARTH IS SPINNING AROUND NOW WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR A PROTOCAL IT MEANS SEE GET THAT LIGHT IN YOUR EYES EARLY IN THE DAY AND ANY TIME YOU WANT TO BE AWAKE SO TRY IND GET AS MUCH SUNLIGHT IN YOUR EYES DURIN THE DAY AS YOU SAFELY CAN WILL TALK ABOUT EY SAFETY THIS EPISODE IN DEPTH AND THE BLUE LIGHT AND THE CONTRAST OF THAT BLUE YELLOW REMEMBER WE DON'T SEE BLUE THIS IS ALL SUBCONSCIOUS THIS IS BLUE REFLECTIONS COMING OFF O SUNLIGHT BLUE LIGHT WE'VE BEEN TOLD OS SO TERRIBLE FOR US IT IS ABSOLUTEY ESSENTIAL AND WONDERFUL FOR WAKING UP THE BRAIN FOR TRIGGERING ALL SORTS OF POSITIVE BOLOGICAL REACTIONS BUT IT NEEDS TO BE VIEWED EARLY IN THE DAY IF YOU CAN'T SEE SUNLIGHT BECAUSE IT'S THE THICK CLOUD COVER OF SA IN AAB YOU KNOW YOU'RE IN THE UQUE AN ITS WINTER THEN ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS IN ESPECIALLY BLUE LIGHTS WOULD BE VERY BENEFICIAL TO YOU HEAN A LOT OF THIS LIGHT AND ITS CONTRAST WITH YELLOW IN ORDER TO TRIGGER THESE MELONOPS AND CELLS WHICH E THEN TRIGER YOUR CIRCADIAN CLOCK WHICH SITS ABOVE THE ROOF YOUR MOUTH WHICH WILL SIGNAL EVERY CELL IN YOUR BODY INCLUDING TEMPERATURE RHYTHMS ET CETERA SO FIRST THINGS FIRST YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM WAS NOT FOR SEEING FACES MOTION ET CETERA THE MOST ANCIENT CELLS IN YOUR EYE WHICH ARE THERE RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK ARE THERE TO INFORM YOUR BODY AND BRAIN ABOUT TIME OF DAY SO YOU WANT TO GET THAT BRIGHT LIGHT EARLY IN THE DAY ABSOLUTE ESSENTIAL TWO TO TEN MINUTES YOU CAN DOWNLOAD T HE LIGHT MEATER AP IF YOU WANT A MEASURE LUCKS WHEN WE EWHEN I EXPLAIN THI DO THAT IN EARLIER EPISODES A GOT A LITTLE CONVOLUTED GET THAT TWO TO TEN MENUTES I DEALY WITH OUT SUNGLASSES NOW HERE'S ANOTHER REASON TO DO THIS AND I'VE NEVER SPOKEN ABOUT THIS BEFORE ON ANY PODCAST WHICH IS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL STUDIES NOW IN THOUSANDS OF SUBJECTS EXPLORING WHAT CAN BE DONE TO PREVENT MYOPIA NEAR SITEDNESS AND OTHER VISUAL DEFECTS AND IT TURNS OUT IN A SERIES OF LARGE CLINICAL TRIALS THE CONCLUSION IS EMERGED THEY GETTING TWO HOURS A DAY OF OUTDOOR TIME WITHOUT SUNGLASSES BLUE LIGHT THIS BLUE LIGHT THAT EVERYONE IS DEMONIZED GETTING THAT SUNLIGHT DURING THE DAY FOR TWO HOURS EVEN IF YOURE READING OTHER THINGS AND DOING OTHER THINGS OUTSIDE HAS A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON REDUCING THE PROBABILITY THAT YOU WILL GET MYOPIA NEAR SIDEDNESS NOW WHETHER NOT THAT'S ALSO DUE TO THE FACT THAT MYOPIA CAN BE CAUSED BY VIEWING THINGS UP CLOSE TO TOO MUCH SO YOU  INDOORS WE TEND TO BE LOOKING AT THINGS MORE CLOSELY RIGHT UNLESS YOU HAVE A VERY LARGE HOUSE WITH WALLS THAT ARE VERY FAR AWAY FROM YOU BUT THE EFFECT DOES SEEM TO BE DIRECTLY RELATED TO GETTING SUNLIGHT AND NOT JUST TO THE DISTANCE THAT YOUR VIEWING I MEN TO DESCRIBE THE STUDY JUST BRIEFLY BUT THIS IS A SECOND PROTOCOLS WE HAVE ONE PROTOCAL ABOUT GETTING SUNLIKE TO SET YOUR CIRCATING CLOCKS MENIN WAKE YOU UP ESTABLISH YOUR SLEEP WILL OCCUR ABOUT TWELVE TO SIXTEEN HOURS LATER THAT'S ALL THE SLEEP EPISODE BUT ALSO TO ENHANCE YOUR MOOD TO ENHANCE YOUR METABOLISM TO OPTIMIZE YOUR HORMON LEVELS AND TO OPTIMIZE LEARNING AND DOPOMY LEVELS THIS FEEL GOOD NOROMODULATOR THAT'S ESSENTIAL TO NOT GETTING DEPRESSED FOR ET CETERA BUT NOW'S A SECOND PROTOCOL WHICH IS IDEALLY AND THIS INCLUDES CHILDREN AS LONG AS THEY ARE NOT VERY SMALL INFANTS IDEALLY WE'RE ALL GETTING TWO HOURS OF OUTDOOR TIME EVEN IF THERE'S CLOUDCOVER REMEMBER WE EVOLVED MOSTLY UNDER OUTDOOR CONDITIONS NOT INDOOR CONDITIONS AND NO ARTIFICIAL BLUE LIGKE WILL NOT REPLACE THIS ASPECT OF YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM AND OFFSETTING MYOPIA SUCH ONE O BRIEFLY DESCRIBED THE STUDY BECAUSE IT A VERY IMPORTANT ONE AND I DON'T THINK IT'S DISCUSSED OFTEN ENOUGH THERE ARE MANY STUDIES EXPLORING THIS BUT ONE OF THE ONES I LIKE THE MOST LOOKED AT SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY THREE STUDENTS AND A SUBSET OF THEM WERE ENCOURAGED TO SPEND ELEVEN HOURS A WEEK OUTDOORS SO MOST KIDS ARE IN SCHOOL FIVE DAYS A WEEK OR SO SO THETE SPENDN ELEVEN HOURS A WEEK OUTDOORS THEY ARE SOMETIMES READING OUTDOORS AND NOT ALWAYS JUST PLAYING OUTDOORS THEY MIGHT BE READING BOOKS ET CETERA THEY USED EIGHT DIFFERENT SCHOOLS AND THE REASON THEY DO THE STUDY I PROBABLY SHOULD HO MENTION IS THAT MYOPIA NEAR SIDENESS IS A GLOBAL EPIDEMIC AT LEAST THAT'S HOW IT WAS REFERRED TO IN THE STUDY I DO'T KNOW WHO DECIDES WHAT'S AN EPIDEMIC OR NOT I THINK THERE THRESHOLDS FOR THAT THIS PAPER PUBLISH IN THE JOURNAL OPTHEMOLOGY IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN DESCRIBED THE FACT THAT BEING OUTDOORS FOR TWO HOURS A DAY COULD COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE PROBABILITY THAT THESE CHILDREN WOULD DEVELOP NEAR SIGHTEDNESS AND IT TURNS OUT BASED ON OTHER STUDIES THAT ADULTS WHO SPEND TWO HOURS A DAY OUTSIDE THAT WOULD BE READING OUTSIDE TALKING OUTSIDE NO IT DOES NOT INCLUDE LIGHT COMIN THROUGH THE WINSHIELD OF YOUR CAR I'LL EXPLAIN WHIN A FEW MOMENTS OFFSET THE THE FORMATION OF MYOPIA NOW MYOPIAARE NEAR SIGHTEDNESS HAS TO DO WITH THE WAY THAT THE LENS FOCUSES LIGHT ON TO THE RETNA I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO A LONG DESCRIPTION OF THIS NOW BUT BASICALLY THE LENS HAS TO BRING LIGHT TO THE RETINA NOT IN FRONT OF IT NOT BEHIND IT IF IT BRINGS LIGHT TO A POSITION IN FRONT OF THE RETNA THEND YOU WON'T SEE CLEARLY YOU WILL NEED CORRECTIVE LENSES IF IT BRINGS LIGHT DIRECTLY TO THE RETNA THAN YOU WILL SEE CLEARLY THAT SHOULD BE INTUITIVE WHY THAT MAKES MAKE SENSE S YOU MIGHT SAY IT WHY WOULD BEING OUTSIDE GETTING THIS BLUE LIGHT OR THIS BUTE BLUE YELLOW CONTRAST FROM SUNLIGHT ACTUALLY OFFSET MYOPIA WELL IT PROBABLY AND I WANT EMPHASIZE PROBABLY HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT THESE MELONOPS AND GANGLING CELLS THESE INTRINSICALLY PHOTOCENS OF GANGLE CELLS ARE NOT JUST RESPONSIBLE FOR SLEEP AND TALKING YOUR CIRCATIN CLOCK AND THAT SORT OF THING THEY ALSO MAKE CONNECTIONS WITHIN THE RETINA THEY CONNECT TO THINGS LIKE THIS IS FOR THE EFFYCIONATOS THE CILEARY BODY THE IRIS THE MUSCLES AND THES STRUCTURES WITHIN THE EYE THAT ACTUALLY MOVE THE LENS AND ALLOW YOU TO ADJUST YOUR VISION TO THINGS UP CLOSE OR FAR AWAY AND IN DOING SO THEY INCREASE OR IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF THE LITTLE TINY MUSCLES WITHIN THE EYE THAT MOVE THE LENS AND THEY PROBABLY AGAIN THIS NEEDS A LITTE BIT MORE WORK IN ORDER TO REALLY TAMP DOWN THE MECHANISM THER PROBABLY ALSO INVOLVED IN IN BRINGING GROWTH FACTORS AND BLOOD SUPPLEYE TO THE MUSCLES AND TO THE NURONS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS FOCUSING MECHANISM WITHIN THE EYE SO REMEMBER YOUR EYE IS AN OPTICAL DEVICE YOU ARE BORN WITH LENSES YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE GLASSES OR MAY BE YOU DO BECAUSE YOU HAVE LENSES IN YOUR EYES AND THOSE LENSES NEED TO MOVE IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A RIGID LENS LIKE A GLASS LENS IS A DIYNAMIC LENS  HAS LITTLE MUSCLES THAT PULL ON IT AND SQUEEZE IT AND MAKE IT THICKER OR THINNER AS YOU LOOK AT THINGS CLOSE AND FAR AWAY AND I'LL DESCRIBE HOW THAT WORKS IN A MOMENT THESE MELONOPSAN SELLS AND THEIR ACTIVATION BY SUNLIGHT COMPLETELY SUBCONSCIOUSLY UNAWARE YOU'RE UNAWARE OF THIS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THIS SYSTEM WITHIN THE EYE AND ALLOW YOU TO OFFSET THE MOPIA NEAR SIGHTEDNESS IN OTHER WORDS GETTING OUTSIDE FOR TWO HOURS A DAY EACH DAY ON AVERAGE EVEN IF THERE'S CLOU D COVER WITHOUT SUN GLASSES ON WILL ALLOW YOU TO OFFSET THE FORMATION OF MYOPIA NOW YOU MIGHT STILL FORM MYOPIA IF YOU HAVE CERTAIN STRUCTURAL FEATURES OR GENETIC BASIS FOR THAT WE WILL TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO AS WELL BUT FOR EVERYBODY WE SHOULD BE DOING THIS D THAT MIGHT SEEM LIKE A LOT BUT THIS IS THE WAY THE YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM WORKS STAYING INDOORS JUST GETTING ARTIFICUAL LIGHT AND LOOKING AT THINGS UP CLOSE LEADS TO VISUAL DEFECS OCHE IT'S A FORM OF KIND OF LIKE VISUAL OBECITY RIGHT THE THE POSTURE OF YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM IF YOU WILL IS GOING TO BE UNHEALTHY IF YOU ARE JUST INDOORS IN YOU'R NOT GETTING SUNLIGHT EARLY IN THE DAY AND FOR AT LEAST TWO HOURS PER DAY I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT HOW OUR EYES ADJUST TO THINGS THAT ARE CLOSE TO US OR FAR AWAY SIS AN ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT CONSEQUENCE OF OUR NATURE AND OUR DESIGN AND WHENEVER I SAY NATURE AND DESIGN PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK ME YOU KNOW WHAT YOU REALLY TRYING TO SAY OR YOU TRYING TO TALK ABOUT CREATORS OR YOU TALKING ABOUT INTELLIGENT DOES NOT LOOK I WANTO BE VERY FRANK WITH YOU I WASN'T CONSULTED THAT THE DHE DESIGN FASE IN NEITHER WERE YOU AND SO THAT IS ALL VERY INTERESTING BUT IT'S NOT THE TOPIC OF THIS DISCUSSION WHAT IS CLEAR AND WHAT IS THE TOPIC OF THIS DISCUSSION IS THAT THE EYE CAN DYNAMICALLY ADJUST WERE LIGHT LANDS BY MOVING THE LENS AND CHANGING THE SHAPE OF THE LENDS IN YOUR EYE THROUGH A PROCESS CALLED ACCOMMODATION AND IF YOU UNDERSTAND THIS PROCESS OF ACCOMMODATION YOU NOT ONLY CAN ENHANCE THE HEALTH OF YOUR EYES IN THE IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM BUT YOU ALSO CAN WORK BETTER YOU'LL BE ABLE TO FOCUS BETTER ON PHYSICAL AND MENTAL WORK YOU WILL BE ABLE TO CONCENTRATE FOR LONGER AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT SO MUCH OF OUR MENTAL FOCUS WHETHER NOT IT'S FOR COGNATIVE ENDEAVORS OR PHYSICAL ENDEAVORS IS GROUNDED IN WHERE WE PLACE OUR VISUAL FOCUS AND WHAT WE LOOK AT AND OUR ABILITY TO HOLD OUR CONCENTRATION THERE IS CRITICALLY DETERMINING HOW WE THINK SO IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU CAN HOLD VISUAL FOCUS YOU CAN HOLD MENTAL FOCUS COGNAT FOCUS BUT HOLDING VISUAL FOCUS IS CHALLENGING IT'S TIRING BECAUSE IT REQUIRES MOVEMENT OF THE LENS AND THAT MOVEMENT OF THE LENS REQUIRES ACTIVATION OF MUSCLES AND THE ACTIVATION OF MUSCLES AS YOU KNOW FROM THE PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE EPISODES YOU SAW THEM AND EVEN IF YOU DON'T IS DICTATED BY NURONS SO WHAT IS A COMMODATION WELL IT'S ACTUALLY VERY SIMPLE AND VERY ELEGANT AND EVER AGAIN THIS IS ANOTHER CASE WHERE WHENEVER I I LOOK AT THE STUFF EVEN HOHAV BEN LOOKING AT FOR YEARS LEARNING ABOUT IT FOR YEARS IT STILL BOGGLOES MY MIND THAT WE HAVE THESE APPARATI BUILT INTO OUR EYES TO WE HAVE LENSES IN OUR EYES AND WE HAVE THESE THINGS CALLED THE IRISES YOU KNOW T YOU'RE ALL FAMILIER WITH THE IRIS BECAUSE YOU'LL SEE POPIL'S PUPILS GET BIGOROR SMALLER AND WE WE INTUITIVELY THINK OF EYES AS HAVING THE PUPILS IF YOU ACTALY DRAW TO U CIRCLES ON ON A A A SHET OF PAPER AND YOU JUST THEY LOOK LIKE TWO CIRCLES BUT IF YU PUT LITTLE DOTS IN THE MIDDLE OF THEM THEY LOOK LIKE EYES YOUR BRAIN RECOGNIZEAS THOSE AS EYES BECAUSE ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS YOU SEE WHEN YOU COME INTO THIS WORLD OR EYES AND ACTUALLY IF YOU PUT THE LITTLE DOTS CLOSE TOGETHER IT'LLOOK KIND OF WRONG LIKE ITS CROSS EYED ND IF YOU PUT THEM AT DIFFERENT LOCATIONS WITHIN THOSE TWO DOTS OF OPPOSING LOCATIONS I TO LOOK GOOGAL EYE AND SEE YOUR BRAIN IS ACTALLY FILLING IN ALL THE FACE AND OTHER INFORMATION EVEN EMOTIONAL INFORMATION JUST BASED ON THIS RECOGNITION OF EYES AND SO THERE'S CLEARLY WE KNOW THIS THERE'S REAL ESTATE DEEP UP NG A FURTHER UP IN THE BRAIN THAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR ANALYZING AND RECOGNIZING FACES AND THE EYES IN THE POSITION OF THESE LITTLE THINGS WE CALL IRISES IN PUPILS ET CETERA IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR HOW WE INTERPRIT THE STATUS OF OTHERS AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SUCH A POWERFUL THING JUST TO PUT TWO  CIRCLES AND YOU KNOW MOVE THE PUPILS AROUND ON ON NOW ON PAPER IN FACT I WANT TO GET INTO A COMMODATION WHAT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IF ONE OF MY PUPILS WAS UP THERE AND THE OTHER ONE WAS DOWN THERE ONE WAS REALLY BIG IND ONE WAS REALLY SMALL THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE A SIGN OF PRETTY SEVERE DAMAGE IF SOME ONE GET HIT HARD ON THE SIDE OF THE HEAD YOU KNOWIE THAT THEY SHINE A LIGHT IN ONE EYE YOU KNOAWE THEYRE DOING THAT THERE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THE OTHER EYE WHEN YOU SHINE LIGHT OF THE YE THAT PUPIL CONSTRICTS TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF LIGHT THAT COMES IN SO DOESN'T DAMAGE THE EYE SALSO HAPPENS WHEN YOU WALK OUTSIDE IN ITS BRIGHT IT CONSTRICTS BUT WE HAVE WHAT'S CALL THE CONSENSUAL PUPIL REFLECTS THERE'S A CONNECTION DEEP IN THE BRAINSTEM DEEP BACK HERE IN THE BRAIN NEAR MY NECK THET CONNECTS THE PUPIL MECHANISM FOR THE TWO EYES AND TERE LOOKING T THE OTHER EYE AND IF YOU SHINE LIGHT IN ONE EYE AND THAT PUPIL CONSTRICTS BUT THE OTHER ONE DOESN TERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THERE'S BRAINSTEM DAMAGE THIS IS WHAT THEY DO ON THE SIDE OF A YOU KNOW FOOTBALL FIELD AR IN BOXING MATCH OR SOME ONE UNFORTUNATE HITS THEIR HEAD SO TWO PUPILS AND DON'T FREAK OUT IF ONE PUPILS A LITLE BIT SMALLER THAN THE OTHERS THAT OTHER THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN BRAIN DAMAGE BUT IF YOU SUDDENLY HAVE ONE PUPIL BIGGER THAN THE OTHER YOU ABSOLUTELY WANT TO GO SEE A NEUROLOGIST RIGHT AWAY SO THESE THE EYES IN THE PUPILS ARE INDICATIVE OF THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING DEEP IN THE BRAIN NOW ACCOMMODATION IS OUR ABILITY TO ACCOMMODATE TO THINGS THAT ARE CLOSE HERE OR FURTHER AWAY AND THE WAY THIS WORKS IS THAT THE IRIS AND A AND A THE MUSCULATURE IN AT STRUCTURE CALLE THE SILIARY BODY MOVE THE LEN SO WHEN YOU LOOK FAR AWAY OR CAN WHEN YOU SEE THINGS FAR AWAY YOUR LENDS ACTUALLY RELAXES IT CAN FLATTEN OUT SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THIS WHEN YOU LOOK FAR AWAY WHEN IT MAY BE ANYWHERE FROM LIKE TWENTY FEED AWAY FROM YOU OUT TO A HORIZON THATS MILES ARE CALOMETERS AWAY FROM YOU THE LENDS CAN JUST RELAXING CAN FLATTEN OUT AND YOU'LL NOTICE THAT IT ACTUALLY IS RELAXING TO LOOK AT A HORIZON IT'S RELAXING TO LOOK FAR AWAY WHEREAS IF I LOOK AT SOMETHING UP CLOSE TO ME LIKE THIS PEN OR MY PHONE OR A COMPUTER SCREEN OR THIS MICROPHONE IT TAKES EFFORT YOU'LL SENSE THE EFFORT NOW SOME OF THAT EFFORT IS ACTUALLY EYE MOVEMENTS BE AS YOU HAVE MUSCLES THAT CAN MOVE YOUR EYES WITHIN THEIR SOCKETS BUT A LOT OF THE WORK QUAT IN QUOTIS NURL WORK OF THE MUSCLES HAVING TO CONTO MOVE AND CONTRACT SUCH THAT THE LENS ACTUALLY GETS THICKER IN ORDER TO BRING THE LIGHT TO THE RETNA AND NOT TO A LOCATION IN FRONT OF IT OR BEHIND IT SO CALLED ACCOMMODATION THERE'S ALSO CHANGES IN THE SIZES OF THE PUPIL AS THINGS ARE CLOSER AND FURTHER AWAY FROM YOU IN FACT THERE'S A SIMPLE WAY TO THING ABOUT THIS HEALTHY PUPILS ARE GOING TO DILATE WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOMETHING FAR AWAY FROM YOU NOW WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING THAT EXCITES YOU OR STRESSES YOU OUT YOUR PUPILS ALSO GET BIG YOUR EYES GET WIDE BUT IF YOU LOOK AT SOMETHING FAR AWAY YOU PUPILS AREGING TO DILATE AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THINGS ARE CLOSER TO YOU WHEN YOU MOVE HIM UP CLOSE THAT PUPILS ARE GOING TO SHRINK THAT'S ALL PART OF THIS ACCOMMODATION MECHANISM NOW YOU MIGHT S AY WHY YOU TELLING ME ABOUT ACCOMMODATION THIS IS CRAZY WHIRE YOU TELLING YOABOUT THIS WELL THESE DAYS WERE SPENDING A LOT OF TIME LOOKING AT THINGS MAINLY ARE PHONES UP CLOSE AND COMPUTERS UP CLOSE AND WE ARE INDOORS IF YOU ARE A YOUNG PERSON AND EVEN IF YOU ARE TWENTY FIVE OR OLDER AND YOU ARE SPENDING A LOT OF TIME LOOKING AT THINGS UP CLOSE AND YU ARE NOT ALLOWING YOUR VISION TO RELAX IN OTHER WHICS YOU ARE NOT GIVING YOUR LENDS THE OPPORTUNITY OF FLATEN OUT AND FOR THESE MUSCLES TO RELIEVE THEMSELVES OF THIS WORK YOU MAYOR MAY NOT HAVE MY GRAN HEADACHES YOU MAYOR MAY NOT HAVE HEADACHES YOU MIGHT AND THAT COULD BE THE CAUSE OF THOSE BUT YOU ARE ALSO TRAINING YOUR EYES TOO BE GOOD AT LOOKING AT THINGS UP CLOSE AND NOT FAR AWAY AND AS A CONSEQUENCE YOU ARE RESHAPING THE NARLE CIRCUITRY IN YOUR BRAIN AND IT IS NOT GOOD IT IS NOT HEALTHY TO ONLY LOOK AT THINGS UP CLOSE NOW THERE ARE LOT OF RECOMMENDATIONS OUT THERE RIGHT NOW ESPECIALLY WITH ALL THE LOCK DOWNS OF THE LAST YOU KNOW TWELVE TOEIGHTEEN MONTHS THAT PEOPLE SHOULD LOOK UP FROM ZUME EVERY ONCE NOWHILE AR MAY BE NOW ON HEARING THAT PEOPLE SOULD TAKE CALLS INSTEAD OF DOING ZUME OR SHOULD LOOK UP FROM YOUR COMPUTER SCREEN IT'S ACTUALLY NOT GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM JUST TO LOOK UP FROM YOUR COMPUTER SCREEN YOU NEED TO GO TO A WINDOW YOU NEED TO LOOK OUT AT A DISTANCE IDEALLY YOU WOULD EVEN OPEN THE WINDOW BECAUSE THOSE WINDOWS ACTUALLY FILTER OUT A LOT OF THE BLUE LIGHT THAT YOU WANT DURING THE DAYTIME A LOT OF THE SUNLIGHT IT'S ACTHALY FIFTY TIMES LESS GETS THROUGH YOU WANT TO GET OUT ON TO A BALCONY YOU WANT TO RELAX YOUR EYES AND LOOK OUT AT THE HORIZON YOU WANT TO GOING TO WHAT'S CALL PANORAMIC VISION LET YOUR VISION EXPAND YOU WANT THIS LENS MECHANISM TO BE VERY ELASTIC YOU DON'T WANT IT TO GET STUCK IN THAT CONFIGURATION OF LOOKING AT THINGS UP CLOSE ACCOMMODATION AS A WONDERFUL FEATURE OF YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO PUSH THAT TOO HARD TOO OFTEN OR FOR TOO LONG YOU WANT TO VIEW THE HORIZON YOU WANT TO GET OUTSIDE NOT JUST TO LIGHT IN THE LOAD ON YOUR MIND OR TO THINK ABOUT OTHER THINGS BUT TO MAINTAIN THE HEALTH OF YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM IN OTHER WORDS YOU WANT TO EXERCISE THESE MUSCLES AND THAT INVOLVES BOTH THE LENS MOVING AND GETTING KIND OF THICKER AND RELAXING THAT LENS AND THE RELAXATION OF THE LENS IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE BEST THINGS YOU CAN DO FOR THE MUSCULATURE OF THE INNER EYE SO WHAT'S THE PROTOCAL HOW OFTEN SHOULD YOU DO THIS YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED BUT FOR EVERY THIRTY MINUTES OF FOCUSED WORK YOU PROBABLY WANT TO LOOK UP EVERY ONCE AE WHILE AND JUST TRYING RELAX YOUR FACE AND I MUSCLES INCLUDING YOUR JAW MUSCLES BECAUSE ALL THESE THINGS ARE CLOSELY LINKED IN THE BRAINSTEM AND ALLOW YOUR EYES TO GO INTO SO CALL PANORAMIC VISION WHERE YOU JUST NOT REALLY FOCUSSING ON ANYTHING AND THEN REFOCUS ON YOUR WORK AT LEAST EVERY NINETY MINUTES OF LOOKING AT THINGS UP CLOSE OR EVEN IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT A SCREEN I A TELIVISION SCREEN OR OR YOU'RE WATCHING A MOVY OR YOU'RE INDOORS FOR EVERY NINETY MINUTES OF THAT YOU IDEALLY WOULD HAVE AT LEAST TWENTY PROBABLY MORE LIKE THIRTY MINUTES OF BEING OUTSIDE IDEALLY BUT IF YOU CAN'T BE OUTSIDE OF GNAWN UP CLOSE VISION YOU MIGHT SAY THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE HOW MY POSE TO DO THAT I YOU KNO'M IN AN OFFICE OR I'M INO BUILDING GET TO A WINDOW GET OUTSIDE IF YOU CAN DO IT SAFELY GET ON TO A BALCONY AND JUST LET YOUR EYES RELAX MANY PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING SEVERE VISION PROBLEMS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT GETTING ENOUGH SUNLIGHT DURING THE DAY THEY'E HAVE SLEEP PROBLES BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT VIEWING SUNLIGHT EARLY IN THE DAY AND AS I'VE MENTION PREVIOUS EPISODES THEYRE GETTING A LOT OF ARTIFICIAL STIMULATION ARTIFICIAL LIKE STIMULATION OF THE EYE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT ALL OF THIS IS THROUGH THE VISUAL SYSTEM SO MY GRAINS FATIGUE CHALLENGE IS WITH YOURE EYESIGHT GETTING WORSE AS YOU AGE OR EVEN IN YOUNG PEOPLE THERE'S AT YOU KNOW AT LEAST ACCORDING TO THE ARTICLES THEY DESCRIBED AS THIS EPIDEMIC OF MYOPIA CAN LARGELY BE DEALT WITH BY GETTING OUTSIDE GOING INTO PANOREMIC VISION EXPERIENCING SOME DISTANCE DIVISION LOOK AT THINGS OFF IN THE HORIZON IF YOU'R WALKING YOUR HIKING YOUR BIKING NOT LOOKING AT YOUR PHONE THE WHOLE TIME THAT YOU'RE DOING THAT I YOU'RE AT THE BUSTOP OR YOUR A COMMUTING CERTAINLY NOT LOOKING AT YOUR PHONE THE ENTIRE TIME YOU'RE DOING THAT SO THIS IS VITAL AND I WANT EMPHASISE ANOTHERPROTOCAL THOUGH I DON'T WANT TO GETT INTO IN TOO MUCH DEPTH CAUSE IE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I ALSO TALK ABOUT A NUMBER OF OTHER IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THE VISUAL SYSTEM THAT ARE MORE RELATED TO SIGHT BUT GETTING INTO OPTIC FLOW IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR DESTRESSING YOUR SYSTEM WHEN YOU MOVE THROUGH SPACE WHETHER NOT THROUGH WALKING BIKING EVEN SWIMMING IF IT SELF GENERATED OPTIC FLOWS SO PROBABLY NOT DRIVING OUR MOTOR CYCLING BUT YES BICICLING OR A UNACYCLIONAM Y THOUGHT BYU UNACYCLING THE USE TO BE GRADUATES UNITE STAMPHORD WHO IS REALLY IMPRESSIVE UNACYCE OR THOSE ARE PRETTY RARE AS LONG AS IT SELF GENERATED OPTIC FLOW MEANING YOUR GENERATING MOTION OF YOUR VODY AND THE VISUAL IMAGES AROUND YOU ARE PASSING BY ON YOUR EYES THAT IS VERY GOOD FOR THE VISUAL SYSTEM AND IT'S VERY GOOD FOR THE MOOD SYSTEMS AND THE NEROMODULATOR SYSTEMS OF THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT REGULATE MOOD THIS IS WELL ESTABLISHED SO I'M NOT TELLING PEOPLE TO GET AWAY FROM THEIR PHONE IN THEIR COMPUTERS I SPEND A LOT OF TIME STARING AT A PAGE DRAWING WRITING TEXTING ET CETERA JUST LIKE YOU DO BUT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT SOME VERY SIMPLE PROTOCALLS THAT ARNCHEST DESIGN TO IMPROVE YOUR SLEEP BUT ARE REALLY DESIGN TO BOLSTER AND ENHANCE YOUR VISION AND OF COURSE BECAUSE IT'S THIS PODCAST WE WILL ALSO TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT YOU CAN TAKE TO IMPROVE YOUR VISION BUT IF YOUR VISUAL BEHAVIOR ISN'T RIGHT AND I DO BELIEVE WE SHOULD ALWAYS START WITH BEHAVIORS AND THEN THINK ABOUT NUTRICTIAN SUPPLEMENTATION ET CETERA IF YOUR BEHAVIORS AROUND VISION AREN'T RIGHT YOU CANNOT EXPECT TO HAVE GOOD HEALTHY EYESIGHT FOR A LONG TIME MEANING THROUGHOUT YOUR LIFE SPAN AND I YOUR VISION IS ALREADY POOR MANY OF THESE THINGS THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT TO DAY PERHAPS ALL OF THEM WILL IMPROVE YOUR VISION TO SOME DEGREE AND IF YOUR VISION IS STARTING TO GO THEND DOING THESE BEHAVIORS IS LIKELY TO REALLY ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF THE VISION THAT YOU WILL BUILD AND MAINTAIN OVER TIME AND ALL OF THESE ARE ESSENTIALLY ZERO COST O IF YOU LIVE IN A VERY DARK ENVIRONMENT LIKE A CAVE OR OUT OR SPACE IT'S CAN BE HARD TO DO SOME OF THIS STUFF BUT IF YOUR ON PLANNED EARTH EVEN IF THERE'S CLOUD COVERED CHANCES ARE YOU CAN DO SUME OR MOST OR EVEN ALL OF THESE SUM MOST OR ALL DAYS WHAT I'M ABOUT TO DESCRIBE NEXT AS GOING TO SEEM SO SILLY ON THE FACE OF IT BUT HAS DEEP MECHANISM TO SUPPORT IT PUT SIMPLY WHEN YOU GET TIRED YOUR EYELIDS CLOSE AND WHEN YOUR ALERT YOUR EYELIDS AR OPEN THAT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE NURONS IN YOUR BRAIN THAT DEPENDING ON YOUR LEVEL OF ALERTNESS WE'LL MAKE IT EASY OR HARD TO KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN NOW THAT'S A COMPLETE DU EXCEPT THAT WE DON'T OFTEN THINK ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ALERTNESS AND WERE WE ARE LOOKING AND OUR EYELIDS NOW I LEAN THIS FROM A COLLIAGUE OF MINE IN PSYCHIETRY WHO HAPPENS WORK ON HYPNOSIS A'ME NOT CON HYPNOTIZE YOU RIGHT NOW THAT'S IS U FOR A FUTURE EPISODE BUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE GET TIRED OUR EYELIDS CLOSE AND OUR CHIN MOVES DOWN WE TEND TO NOT OUT THIS WAY IF YOU IT HAVE EVER BEEN IN A CLASSROM CERTAINLY NOT ONE OF MIND BUT IF YOU'VE BEEN IN A CLASSRUM AND THE LECTURER IS KIND OF DRAWING ON ORS THE AFTERNOON W Y'LL NOTICE IS THAT NUMBER OF STUNES THEIR HEADS ARE JULT KOND THEIR EYELIDS ARE CLOSING AND THEIR CHIN IS DROPPING AND THEN THEY YOU'LL SEE I MONCHHEADS BALANCING BACK UP I I WAS DEAFINLY ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE IN CLASS FEELIS POST LUNCH EN THE AFTERNOON IT'S WARM THE HUM OF THE AIR CONDITION OR WHATEVER IT IS AND I JUST OUT KI WHEN WE'RE WIDE AWAKE THE OPPOS IT HAPPENS OUR EYELIDS ARE OPEN ALL THE WAY AND OUR CHIN HAPPENS TO BE UP AND KNOW THIS IS NOT ME TELLING YOU TO HAVE GOOD POSTURE HOWEVER WHAT I LEARN FROM MY COLLIU AT STAMFORED IS THAT THESE CIRCUITS ACTUALLY ACT IN LOOPS WHEN WE LOOK UP MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE THESE MELONOPS AND CELLS ARE IN THE BOTTOM OF OUR RETNA THEY ARE AND MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE THERE THERE IN ORDER TO VIEW SUNLIGHT WHICH IS OVERHEAD WHICH IT IS BUT THAT SYSTEM OF ALERTNESS IS LINKED TO THE POSITION OF OUR EYES SO WHEN WE LOOK UP AND OUR EYELIDS ARE UP IT ACTUALLY HAS A PURPOSE IT ACTUALY CREATES A WAKEFULNESS SIGNAL FOR THE BRAIN AND SO H THIS MIGHT SEEM LIKE THE SILLIEST AND SIMPLE TOOL THAT I MIGHT EVER DESCRIBE ON THIS PODCAST IF YOU ARE FEELING TIRED IT ACTUALLY CAN BE BENEFICIAL TO THE WAKEFULNESS SYSTEMS OF THE BRAIN INCLUDING THE LOCUST SERULIUS AND THESE AREAS THAT RELEASE NOR UP IN EFFERENT TO ACTUALLY LOOK UP TO ACTUALLY LOOK UP TOWARD THE CEILING YOU DON'T WANT YOUR CHIN ALL HAWAY BACK BUT TO LOOK UP AND TO RAISE YOUR EYES TOWARD THE CEILING AND TO LOOK UP AND TRY AND HOLD THAT FOR TEN TO FIFTEEN SECONDS SO THIS ISN'T LOOKING UP AND CLOSING YOUR EYES LIKE I ANON A NICE SUNNY DAY THAT'S RELAXING THIS IS LOOKING UP AND ACTUALLY LOOKING UP AT THE CEILING IT ACTUALLY TRIGGERS SOME OF THE AREAS OF THE BRAIN THAT ARE INVOLVED IN WAKEFULNESS SO YOUR SOMEBODY WHO IS FALLING A SLEEP AT YOUR WORK THIS CAN BE VERY BENEFICIAL LIKEWISE MANY PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT THEIR PHONE ALL DAY AND THEIR CHIN IS DOWN AND THEN THEIRE SITTING AT A COMPUTER THAT'S POSITION BELOW THEM IN THEIR HAVING TROUBLE STAYING AWAKE OR FOCUSSING IT CAN BE VERY BEEN I TELL COSTELO THIS ALL THE TIME CASE THESE ALWAYS FALLING A SLEEP WHILL IS TRIN TO DO HIS WORK POSITIONING YOUR COMPUTER SCREEN UP AT EYELEVEL OR SOMETIMES HAVING IT ACTULLY ABOVE EYE LEVEL CAN ACTUALLY CREATE WAKEFULNESS AND ALERTNESS FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO THIS IS SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THIS CONNECTION BETWEEN THE BRAINSTEM CIRCUITS AND THE OTHER NARL CIRCUITS THAT CONTROL WAKEFULNESS AND EYELIDS OPENING AND LOOKING UP OC SO IT'S AGAIN IT'S REMARKABLY SIMPLE ALMOST LAUGHABLY SIMPLE BUT IT'S GROUNDED IN SOME OF THE MOST HORRD WIRED MEANING PRESENT FROM BIRTH ASPECTS OF OUR NORL CIRCUITRY AND NOR UP AN EFFERAND RELEASE FROM LOCU SERULIUS ISN'T JUST A MOUTHFUL IT'S A REALLY INTERESTING AND POWERFUL MECHANISM FOR HOW THE REST OF THE BRAIN WAKES UP LOCUS RULIES HOSES THE REST OF YOUR BRAIN WITH NOR UP INEFFERON IN ORDER TO WAKE UP THOSE CIRCUITS FOR WORK AND ATTENTION AND SO EYES UP IS ACTUALLY A WAY A ROUTE INTO INCREASED ALERTNESS EYES DOWN IS A ROUTE INTO SLEEPINES INTO REDUCED ALERTNESS AND I O HAVE ONLY ONE FRIEND THAT TECTS UP HERE LIKE ON THE STREET HOLDS HIS PHON UP HERE IT LOOKS RIDICULOUS AND YET YOU KNOW IF WE WERE TRYING TO CREATE MORE SENSE OF ALERTNESS IF THAT'S YOUR GOAL POSITION IN COMPUTERSCREENS UP HIGH CHIN UP LOOKING UP IF YOU NEED TO KIND OF CREATE AN ALERTNES SIGNAL NOT ALWAYS BEING CHIN DOWN IND TEXTING OR OR WORKING INTO TYPEWRITERS A READING BELOW US IS ACTUALLY GOING TOSEND A RECURRING WAKEFULNESS SIGNALED IF WHEN THINGS ARE UP WE TEND TO BE ALERT WHEN EVERYTHINGS FOLKASS DOWN IN CLING YOUR EYES IT TENDS TO HAVE A MORE SUPPRESSIVE OR SET IT IVE TYPE SIGNALING TO THE DEEPER CENTERS OF THE BRAIN NOW BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE SCIENCE AND TOOLS AND PROTOCOLS RELATED TO PATTERN VISION I WANT A MENTION ANOTHER STUDY THAT WAS DONE BY THE UNIVERSEY A PENNSYLVANIA THAY AVE A TERRIFIC GROUP THAT WERE TERE THAT WORKS ON SLEEP THE MAD AN IMPORTANT DISCOVERY THAT I THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD KNOW ABOUT WHICH IS THAT CHILDREN THAT SLEEP IN ROOMS THAT HAVE A NIGHT LIGHT OR DIM LIGHTS ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO DEVELOP MYOPIA NEAR SIGHTEDNESS CONVERSELY CHILDREN THAT SLEEP IN VERY DARK ROOMS SO EITHER VERY DIM NIGHT LIGHTS OR COMPLETE BLACK THEY HAVE A MUCH LOWER STATISTICALLY SPEAKING A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER PROBABILITY A DEVELOPING MYOPIA NEAR SIGHTEDNESS NOW WHY IS THAT IT'S BECAUSE THE WAVE LENGTHS OF LIGHT THAT MATTER FOR THESE MELENOPS AN CELLS OFTEN TIMES CAN GET THROUGH THE EYELIDS AND THAT'S PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR CHILDREN AND PEOPLE THAT HAVE THIN EYELIDS SOME PEOPLE LIKE ME HAVE VERY THIN EYELIDS I'VE BEEN TOLD THIS BEFORE NOT MANY PEOPLE TOUCH MY EYELIDS BUT AMONG THOSE THAT HAVE THAT VERY THIN EYELIDS I NOTICE I VERY THIN EYELIDS COMPARED TO SAY COSTELLO NOW COSTELLO'S EYES DROUP YOU CANT EVEN CLOSEIS EYES ALL THE WAY THEIR SO DROUPI BUT MANY PEOPLE HAVE THIN EYELIDS AND THOSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE EVEN MORE PRONE TO LIGHT COMING IN THROUGH THE EYELID SO FOR PARENTS FOR KIDS AND FOR ADULTS YOU REALLY WANT TO TRY TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE YOU CAN SLEEP IN A COMPLETELY BLACK OR DARK ENVIRONMENT ONE LITTLE EXPOSURE TO LIGHT NO BIG DEAL BUT THIS TIES BACK TO THE OTHER PROTOCALLED I HAVE DESCRIBED BEFORE IN THE MOOD AND SLEEP EPISODES WHICH IS THAT VIEWING LIGHT EVEN OF VERY LOW INTENSITY BETWEEN THE HOURS OF TEN P M AND FORE A M IS EXTREMELY DETRIMENTAL TO THE DOPOMENE ANOTHER MOOD PRODUCING SYSTEMS OF THE BRAIN IT CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT LEARNING AND IMMUNITY AND EVEN BLOOD SUGAR AND MAKE PEOPLE TIGHT TO DIABEDES PRONE BY WAY OF COMMUNICATION FROM THESE MELONOPS AND SELLS TO A STRUCTURE IN THE RAIN CALL THE HOBANULA WHY AMI THROWING OUT ALL THIS VERBAGE WHILE BECAUSE PEOPLE OF ASKD FROR MORE MECHANISM SO IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT BLUE LIGHT OR IF BLUE LIGHT IS GETTING IN THROUGH YOUR EYELIDS IN THE MILL THE NIGHT IT IS LIKELY DISSTORTING THESE LENDS ACCOMMODATION MECHANISM IN THE EYE AND LEADING TO MYOPIA IN SOME CASES SO THAT'S ONE REASON TO AVOID LULIGHT EXPOSURE AND BRIGHT LIGHT EXPOSURE EVEN NIGHT LIGHT EXPOSURE MILL THE NIGHT VIEWING ANY LIGHT OF BRIGHT INTENSITY BETWEE THE HOURS OF TEN P M AND POR A M ON A CONSISTENT BASIS IS GOING TO SUPPRESS DOPAMINE BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THAT LIGHT ACTIVATES THESE MELLNOPS AND SELLS AND THE HABENULA AND THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM SO IT'S ALL VERY SIMPLE GET AS MUCH BRIGHT LIGHT AS YOU CAN CAN SAFELY RIGHT YOU NEVER WANT TO LOOK AT ANY LIGHT SO BRIGHT THAT IT'S PAINFUL LOOK AT DURING THE DAYTIME TRY AND GO WITHOUT SUNGLASSES UNLESS YOU NEED THEM NOW I WEAR SUNBLASSES FOR SAKE OF SPORT AND SAKE WHEN IT'S REALLY BRIGHT OUT BUT I TRY TO GET TWO HOURS A DAY OF WORKING OUT SIDE OR BEEN OUTSIDE EVEN IF THERE'S CLOUD COVER THAT'S GON OFFSET MYOPIA IT'S GOING TO HELP YOU GET BETTER SLEEP IT'S GOING TO SUPPORT MOOD AND METABOLISM ET CETERA AND AT NIGHT IF YOUARE SLEEPING WITH A LOT OF LIGHTS IN THE ROOM AND ESPECIALY IF THER ARE KIDS THAT NEED A NIGHT LIGHT YOU SHOULD TRY AND WEEN THEM OFF THAT NIGHT LIGHT BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE BENEFICIAL FOR THEIR VISION TO WEEN THEM OFF THAT NIGHT LIGHT AND PUT THEM INTO A DARKER ENVIRONMENT I VUS EYOU WANT TO GET THEM EMOTIONALLY COMFORTABLE IT THAT FIRST NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT PATTERN VISION ACTUAL SEEING THINGS LIKHE FACES AND COLORS ET CETERA I'M PRESUMING THAT SOME OF YOU OUT THERE ARE COLOR BLIND WE CAN ALL HELP THE RED GREEN COLOR BLIND FOLKS OUT THERE BY NOT USING RED AND SLIDES AND DIAGRAMS AND ON MENUSE AND THINGS OF THAT SORT CRINUSE MAGENTA INSTEAD THEY CAN SEE THE CONTRAST BETWEEN MAGENTA AND GREEN BETTER THEN IF THERE'S RED AND GREEN SO BE KIND TO THE COLOR BLIND FOLKS OUT THERE ATSESHY OF AFFAIR PERCENTAGE AND THEIR LOTTED DIFFERENT KINDS OF COLOR BLIND ISHJUST MENTION SOME PEOPLE ARE TRUE MONOCHROMATS THEY SEE THE WORLD IND BLACK AND WHIGHT THAT'S EXCEEDINGLY RARE MOST COLOR BLIND PEOPLE COLOR BLIND IND QUOTES AR RED GREEN COLOR BLIND MEANING THEY LACK RED CONE PHOTOPIGMEN MEANING THEY CAN'T SEE LONG WAVELINGS OF LIGHT SO THEY SEE THE WORLD MUCH AS A CANINE OR A CAT DOES WHERE THEY DON'T GET THE GREEN RED CONTRAST AS WHERE WE COLL IT RED GREEN COLOR BLIND THEY HAVE THE GREEN CONES BUT THEY CAN'T DO THE CONTRAST COMPARISON THAT I DESCRIBED IT THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE SO USE MAGENTA AND THEY WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THINGS YOU WONDER WHY STOP SINDS AND STOP LIGHTS AND THINGS AREN'T IM MAGENTA WELL BECAUSE THE WORLD IS UNKIND TO THE RED GREEN COLOR BLIND INDIVIDUALS AND THEY HAVE TO LEARN THE POSITION OF THOSE LIGHTS IN THE IN THE STREET LIGHTS AND THEY HAVE TO LEARN THE SHAPES OF SIGNS WHICH THEY CAN DO READILY AND IT USUALLY SAYS STOP ON IT AS WELL BUT IF YOU CARE ABOUT COLOR BLIND FOLKS WHICH I DO THEN A WE COUL ALL DO THEM A SERVICE PIDE I THINK BY LAW ACTUALLY IN THE US A MENUS ARE REQUIRED TO BE COLOR BLIND EXCESSIBLE HOW CAN YOU IMPROVE YOUR VISION HOW CAN YOU GET BETTER AT SEEING THINGS WELL ONE WAY IS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU SPEND AT LEAST TEN MINUTES A DAY TOTAL AT LEAST VIEWING THINGS OFF IN THE DISTANCE SO THAT WOULD BE WELL OVER HALF A MILE OR MORE TRY AND SEE A HORIZON TRY AND GET YOUR VISION OUT TO A LOCATION THAT'S BEYOND THE FOUR WALLS OF YOUR HOUSE ARE APARTMENT AH OR THE DOORS OF YOUR CAR IN THE WINSHIELD OF YOUR CAR I KNOW THAT CAN BE HARD TO DO BUT IT'S VERY VALUABLE IF YOU LIVE IN A CITY LIKE NEW YORK AND ITS SKYSCRAPERS EVERYWHERE YOUE PROBABLY EXPERIENCE THE INCREDIBLE SENSE OF RELAXATION AND IT'S ESTHETICALLY BEAUTIFUL WHEN YOU ARE WALKING DOWN ONE OF THESE LONG AVENUES AND YOU TURN AND I THINK THEYHAVE A NAME FOR THIS IN NEW YORK AH WHERE THE SUNSET IS UNSUDDENLY VISIBLE ALONG THE LONG AVENUE BETWEEN SOME SKY SCRAPERS AND IT'S JUST VERY RELAXING TO BE ABLE SUDDENLY TO SEE AT A DISTANCE AND THAT'S ACTUALLY BECAUSE THIS EYE MECHANISM RELAX RELAXING THE LENDS AND RELAXING SOME OF THE MUSCULATURE ROUND THE EYES SEND SIGNALS DEEP INTO THE BRAINSTEM THAT RELEASE SOME OF THE CENTERS THAT INVOLVED IN ALERTNESS ACA STRESS AND IT'S VERY PLEASANT FOR REASON IT'S NOT A A IT'S NOT A PLACIBO EFFECT IF YOU WILL THERE ARE BUNCH OF NARRO CHEMICALS AND THINGS THEIRE ASSOCIATE WITH THAT SO TRY AND SEE AT A DISTANCE BECAUSE IT'S GOOD FOR YOUR EYESIGHT IT'LL KEEP THIS LENDS NICE AND ELASTIC AND THE MUSCLES NICE AND STRONG THAT MOVE THE LENS AND IT HAS THIS RELAXING COMPONENT TO IT NOW OR VISUAL SYSTEM IS EXQUISITELY TUNED TO MOTION NOT JUST OUR SELF GENERATY MOTION BIT THE MOTION OF THINGS AROUND US AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IT DOES IS SOMETHING CALLED SMOOTH PURSUIT SMOOTH PURSUIT IS OUR ABILITY TO TRACK INDIVIDUAL OBJECTS MOVING AS THE NAME SUGGEST SMOOTHLY THROUGH SPACE INVARIOUS TRAJECTORIES YOU CAN ACTUALLY TRAIN OR IMPROVE YOUR VISION BY LOOKING AT SMOOTH PURSUIT STIMULE THAT SOUNDS REALLY BORING WHAT YOU CAN DO IS AND I'LL PROVIDE A LINK TO SOME THAT I THINK ARE PRETTY GOOD THAT ARE USED IN VARIOUS CLINIX APTHEMOLOGY AND APPTOMETRY CLINIX YOU CAN ACTUALLY TAKE A FEW MINUTES EACH DAY OR MAY BE IF YOU DON'T DO ITO EACH DAY YOU COULD EVERY THIRD DAY OR SO AND ACTUALLY JUST VISUALLY TRACK OF ALL SOMETIMES IT'S MOVING IN IN KIND OF AN INFINITY SYMBOLE SOMETIMES IT'S MORE OF A SAW TOOTH SOME THIMES ITS CHANGING SPEED SOMETIMES THE AWE THE CUE THAT YOU'RE FOLLOWING THE LITTLE TARGET IS A DILATING AND CONTRACTING THIS IS GOING TO KEEP THE MUSCLES I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT'S GOING TO KEEP THE EXTRA OCULAR MUSCLES CONDITIONED AND STRONG AND ALLOW YOU TO HAVE A HEALTHY SMOOTH PURSUIT SYSTEM REMEMBER THE BRAIN FOLLOWS THE EYE IT FOLLOWS THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EYE IT HAS TO DEAL WITH THAT AND THE NERLE CIRCUITS WITHIN THE BRAIN HAVE TO COPE WITH CHANGES IN SMOOTH PURSUITS OF YOU'RE DOING A LOT OF READING UP CLOSES YOU'RE NOT VIEWING HORIZONS YOU'RE NOT GETTING A LOT OF SMOOTH PURSUIT TYPE STIMULATION FROM YOUR LIFE OR YOU'RE JUST GETTING IT WITHIN THE CONFINES OF A LITTLE BOX ON YOUR PHONE LIKE YOUR YOUR SMOOTH PURSUIT IS OVER YOU KNOW MILLIMETERS ARE WHAT WE WEWE ALWAYS TALKING FROMS OF VISUAL LANGLE BUT THE AMOUNT OF DEGREES OF VISULANGLE BUT IF YOU'RE JUST LOOKING AT SMOOTH PURSUIT IN THIS LITTLE TINY BOX ON YOUR PHONE AR ON NEAR COMPU ER SCREEN AND YOU'RE NOT LOOKING AT OBJECTS IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT LIKE SWOOPING BIRDS AND THINGS LIKE THAT WHICH I'M GUESSING MANY OF YOU ARE NOT SPENDING YOUR TIME DOING WHILE THESE MECHANISMS FOR SMOOTH PURSUIT WILL GET WORSE OVER TIME YOUR VISION WILL GET WORSE AND SO WHILE I PREFER THAT PEOPLE GET OUT INTO THE REAL WORLD AN EXPERIENCE SMOOTH PURSUIT TRACKING OF VISAL OBJECTS HOR MAYES A GOOD REASON TO GO TO A HOCKY GAMER YOU KNOW WAT TRYING KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE POCK WHICH I CAN NEVER SEEM TO DO MOVE SO FAST OR THE IGASIS A GOOD REASON TO WATCH LIVE SPORTS IF THAT'S YOUR THING OR WATCH A TENIS MATCH LIKE A CAT LIKE AGAIN WATCHING THE BALL GO BACK AND FORTH WHATEVER WATCHING KIDS PLAY IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER THE THE IDEA IS THAT YOU WANT TO USE THE VISUAL SYSTEM REGULARLY FOR WHAT IT WAS DESIGNE FOR IN SMOOTH PURSUIT IS A GREAT WAY TO KEEP THE VISUAL AND MOTION TRACKING SYSTEMS OF THE BRAIN AN THE EYE IN THE EXTROCULAR MUSCLES WORKING IN REALLY NICE CORDINATE FASHION I WOULD SAY FIVE TO TEN MINUTES THREE TIMES A WEEK WILL BE GREAT IF YOU CAIRE ABOUT YOUR VISION YOU CAN TRAIN YOUR VISION IN THIS WAY THE OTHER ONE IS TO TRAIN ACCOMMODATION THERE ARE LOT OF VIDIOS OUT THERE I WON TOF BE CLEAR ON THE INTERNET SOME OF WHICH A ARE FROM CLINITION SO OF WHICH ARE NOT SOME OF WHICH ARE FROM SCIENTIST SOME OF WHICH ARE FROM OTHER SOURCES TALKING ABOUT THINGS YOU CAN DO  TO MAKE YOUR VISION BETTER TO IMPROVE YOUR VISION MOST OF THOSE ARE GEAR TOWARD IMPROVING THE EXTROCULAR EY MUSCLES BUT I DID CONSULT WITH OUR CHAIR OF OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE JEFF GOLDBERT WHOIS AN EMTY ENIPIHTY A PHENOMINAL SCIENTISTS AN A PHENOMINAL CLINITION AND INCINTLY A PHENOMINAL CHAIRMAN AS WELL ABOUT WHAT SORTS OF THINGS TOOLS ARE ACTUALLY BENEFICIAL FOR PATTERN VISION IN SIGHT BECAUSE THERE'S JUST SO MUCH OUT THERE ON THE INNERNET A NOT ALL OF WHICH IS ACCURATE OR GOOD FRANKLY AND HE AGREED THAT A SMOOTH PURSUIT STIMULUS THAT KIND OF TRAINING AS WELL AS OR EXERCISE AS WELL AS NEAR FAR SO SPENDING A FEW MINUTES YOU MIGHT EVEN JUST DO THIS FOR TWO MINUTES OF LOOKING AT SOMETHING UP CLOSE THAT'S GONG TO ACTIVATE THESE ACCOMMODATION MECHANISMS AND THEN MOVING IT AT ARMS LENGTH AND FOCASSING ON IT FOR FIVE TEND SECONDS MAY BE MORE MAY BE A FIFTEEN OR TWENTY SECONDS THEN SLOWLY MOVING IT IN TO A LOCATION AND THEN OUT THIS IS ACTUALLY A LOT LIKE THE VISUAL TRAINING THAT'S DONE POST CONCUSSION TO TRAIN REPAIR ACTUALLY REPAIR SOME OF THE BALANCE AND MOTOR AND VISUAL AND COGNITIVE ASPECTS OF THE BRAIN AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A GUEST ON AND OF FUTURE TIME OF THAT TO DEAL WITH CONCUSSION AND SOME POST CONCUSSION TRAINING A LOT OF POST CONCUSSION RECOVERY IN TRAINING CENTERES AROUND THE VISUAL SYSTEM NOT JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO RECOVER THEIR VISION AND THEIR SENSE OF BALANCE BUT BECAUSE AS I MENTION EARLIAR THE BRAINS ABILITY TO MAKE SENSE OF ITS ENVIRONMENT AND THE BRAINS ABILITY TO PARTS TIME NOT JUST ON THE DAY NIGHT SCHEDUAL BUT ALSO SHORTER TIME INTERVALS FOLLOWS THE VISUAL SYSTEM SOMETHING WILL TURN TO A LITTLE BIT MORE AT THE END SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN THE TOOL IS SPEND TWO TO THREE MINUTES DOING SMOOTH PURSUIT THERE SOME PROGRAMS ON YOU TO U UH YOU CAN JUST LOOK UP SMOOTH PURSUIT STIMULUS AND ALL PROVIDLINK TO TO A COUPLE I LIKE AS WELL YOU COULD DO THIS WITH A PEN IF YOU WANTED YOU COULD DO THIS AH SOME ONE ELSE COULD HOLD A WAND AND YOU COUN O THAT IF YOU GETS OME THEY CAN DO THAT FOR YOU PRACTISE ACCOMMODATION FOR A FEW MINUTES MAY BE EVERY OTHER DAY JUST BRINGING SOMETHING IN CLOSE YOU'LL FEEL THE STRAIN OF YOUR EYES DOING THAT I CAN FEEL RIGHT NOW MOVE IT OUT YOU'LL FEEL A RELAXATION POINT MOVE IT PASS THAT RELAXATION POINT WHERE YOU WILL HAVE TO DO WHAT'S CALE THE VERGENCE IVE MOVEMENT TO MAINTAIN FOCUS ON THAT LOCATION AS IT MOVES OUT BRING IT BACK IN AT THE POINT WHERE YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO GO CROSSEDE THIS WILL DIFFER FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE DEPENDING ON HOW FAR APART YOUR EYES ARE SO CALLED INTERPUPILAERY DISTANCE SO FOR ME I HAVE BEEN TEASED BEFORE I 'VE A VERY SHORT INTERPUPILARY DISTANCE I'M NOT A CYCLOPS BUT I'M HEADEN THERE SOMET PEOPLE ARE MORE WALLIDE LIKE A FLOUNDER WELL DEPENDING ON YOUR INTERPUPILARY DISTANCE THE POINT AT WHICH THINGS GET BLURRY AND CROSSEDE WILL VERY BUT FOR ME YOU KNOW AS I GET ABOUT UHASH YES IS ABOUT SIX INCURS FROM MY NOSE IT'S REALLY HARD I CAN'T ACCOMMODATE ANY LONGER I MOVE IT OUT ANOTHER INCH IN EVERYTHINGS IN NICE FOCUS TRY AND SEE WHETHER NOT YOU CAN GET THINGS CLOSER NOW YOU DON'T WANT TO GET CROSSEDE REMEMBER WHAT YOUR PARENTS TOLD YOU OR MY PARENTS TOLD ME THAT IF YOU CROSS YOUR EYES WHEN YOUR YOUNG THAT THEY CAN STAY THAT WAY ASHY THEY WON'T NESARY STAY THAT WAY BUT YOUR BRAIN CAN START LOSING INFORMATION AND THE ABILITY TO SEE BYNOCULAR DEPTH SOMETHING WILL TALK ABOUT IN A MOMENT BUT FOR NOW THE PROTOCOL WOULD BE YOUTOTWO TO THREE MAY BE FIVE MINUTES JUST PRACTISE THAT PRACTISE ACCOMMODATION AND THEN BE SURE TO GIVE YOUR EYES SOME REST GET OUTSIDE LOOK AT A HORIZON OR DO NOTHING JUST CONE TO LET YOUR EYES GO SOFT THIS WHAT THE YOGIES WOULD CALL SOFT GAZS JUST CONE RELAX YOUR EYELIDS NOT THIS NOT EYES CLOSE JUST RELAX PANORAMIC VISION TRY AND SEE THE WALLS AROUND YOU WITHOUT MOVING YOUR HEAD EXERCISE YOUR EYE MUSCLES EXERCISE THE ACCOMMODATION MECHANISMS OF YOUR EYES PRACTISE ILLE BIT OF SMOOTH PURSUIT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE NAURADIC ABOUT THIS BUT YOU IF YOU DO THIS OFTEN ENOUGH MEANING EVERY OTHER DAY EVERY THIRD DAY OR SO YOU CAN BE THE STRANGE PERSON ON THE PLAIN OR IN THE CLASS FROM DOING THIS YOU KNOW THAT PEOPLE MIGHT CHUCKLE OR LOOK AT YOU FUNNY OR OR TEASE YOU BUT THAT'S SOCAVE BECAUSE A YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE WHEN THEY ARE UNLOSING THEIR VISION AS YOU'LL GET THE LAST LAUGH UH PLEASE DON'T LAUGH AT THEM BUT MAYBE YOU CAN HELP THEM AT THAT POINT YOU CAN HOLD THE PEN FOR THEM UH IT'S WORTH DOING IT'S REALLY WORTH PRESERVING YOUR VISION AND AGAIN IF YOU ARE A YOUNG PERSON THIS IS GREAT BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY BUILD AN EXTRA STRONG VISUAL SYSTEM YUSING ALL THE TOOLS THAT WERE DESCRIBING I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT A NEW SET OF FINDINGS THAT ARE RELATED TO RED LIGHT AND OFFSETTING AGE RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION THEIR LOT OF WAYS IN WHICH OUR VISUAL SYSTEM GETS WORSE OVER TIME BUT ONE IS SO CALLED AGE RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION GLEND GEFFREY AT THE UNIVERSITY CCOLLEGE LONDON SOMEBODY I'VE KNOWN FOR DECADES AS A BECAUSE HE'S A SCIENTIST A IS DONE BEAUTIFUL WORK ON DEVELOPMENT AND FUNCTION THE VISUAL SYSTEM HAS PUBLISH A NUMBER OF PAPERS RECENTLY A ONE THAT GOT A PARTICULARLY A HIGH AMOUNT OF ATTENTION IN THE PRESSD WAS ONE THAT SHOWED THAT FLASHING RED LIGHT INTO THE EYES EARLY IN THE DAY NOT LATE IN THE DAY EARLY IN THE DAY A CAN HELP OFFSET SOME AGE RELATED MACULAR GEGENERATION PRESUMABLY BY ENHANCING THE MITO CONDREAL FUNCTION IN THE PHOTORECEPTORS THERE DOES SEEM TO BE SOME EVIDENCE FOR THAT ALTHOUGH IT STILL EARLY DAYS I WANT EMPHASIZE YOU DON'T WANT TO SHINE REALLY BRIGHT LIGHTS INTO YOUR EYES YOU NEVER WANT A LOOK AT ANY LIGHT THAT SO BRIGHT THAT IT'S PAINFUL AND YOU NEVER WANT O FORCE YOUR EYELIDS TO STAY OPEN IF YOU NEED TO CLOSE YOUR EYES IN ORDER TO BE COMFORTABLE WITHIN CHANCES ARE THAT LIGHT IS TOO BRIGHT BUT DOING JUST A COUPLEMINUTES TO DAY LIKE TWO MINUTES A DAY OF FLASHING THIS RED LIGHT INTO ONE EYE AND THEN THE OTHER AS LONG AS IT WAS EARLY IN THE DAY BEFORE NOONTIME AND AS LONG AS IT WAS IN INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE FORTY YEARS OR OLDER DID SEEM TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT IN OFFSETTING SOME OF THE AGE RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION THAT WOULD OTHERWISE OCCUR AGAIN THESE ARE EARLY FINDINGS IF YOU WANT TO DO THIS PLEASE BE CAREFUL PLEASE TALK YOUR OPTOMATRIS AN AND OR OPTHEMOLOGIST YOUR EYESIGHT IS PRECIOUS YOU DO'T WANT TO DAMAGE IT BUT IT IS INTERESTING AND IT DOES SEEM LIKE RED LIGHT CAN IMPROVE THE FUNCTION OF THE MITOCONDRA THESE PHOTORECEPTORS HAWALITOMOTIC MITOCONDREA THET ENERGY PRODUCING A ORGANELLS WITHIN THE CELLS BECAUSE THEY ARE SOME OF THE MOST METABOLICALLY ACTIVE CELLS IN YOUR ENTIRE BODY YOUR PHOTORECEPTORS YOUR ACTIVE ALL THE TIME AS YO'RE LOOKING ROUND AND EVEN WHEN YOUR EYES ARE CLOSED THEIR ACTIVE IN FACT THROUGH A WEIR TWIST OF THE BIOLOGY AND PLEASE LOOK THIS UP IF YOUR REALLY INTEREST IN THIS YOUR PHOTORECEPTORS AR ACTUALLY MOST ACTIVE IN THE DARK IS A SO WEIRD IT'S A TWIST OF A BIOLOGY THE WAY THE SYSTEM A ARRANGED THAT WHEN LIGHT COMES ON THEY SHUT OFF THEIR ACTIVITY SO ACTUALLY WEATHER NOT YOU SEE SOMETHING IN FRONT OF YOU LIKE THIS PEN OR MY FACE IS BECAUSE THE WAYS YOUR PHOTORECEPTORS ARE TURNING OFF NOT TURNING ON IT'S A REALLY COOL TWIST AND I NO ONTOGO TOO FAR DOWN THAT RABBIT HOLE A BUT CHECK IT OUT A IF YOUR INTEREST IN HOWPHOTORECEPTORS WORK ITS AN ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE LITERATURE A JUST GOGUL EXCUSE ME LOOK UP ON THE WEB WE ARE NOT PARTIAL JUST TO GOUGAL I HAPPEN USE GUGAL BUT A USE YOUR WEBBROWSER TO LOOK UP A PHOTORECEPTERS HYPEROPOLARIZATION SIGHT AND YOU CAN LEARN A LOT ABOUT THAT IF YOUARE REAL NERVE FOR THE STUFF LIKE I AM OKE SO RED LIGHT TO THE EYE CAN PERHAPS IT SEEMS A HELP MAINTAIN VISION DOING SMOOTH PURSUED EXERCISES AN ACCOMMODATION NEAR FAR EXERCISES SOME PEOPLE SUFFER FROM POOR EYESIGHT SIMPLY BECAUSE THEIR EYES GET DRY THERE ARE INCREDIBLE BELIEVE IT OR NOT LUBRICATING MECHANISMS FOR THE EYE NOT JUST TEARS BUT THIN SHEET OF OIL MIT'S JUST AMAZING UNLESS YOU HAVE SOME SORT OF CORNEALABRASION THE CORNIAS THE CLEAR STUFF ON THE OUTSIDE YOUR EY CORNIOL B ABRASION WHEN YOU BLINK IT'S SMOOTH YOU DON'T FEEL IT IT'S JUST REALLY REALLY SMOOTH AND YET IF YOU EVER HAD A CORNEAL SCRATCH I'VE HAD THIS ITS REALLY ROUGH IT IS SO PAINFUL YOU HAVE A TON OF PAIN RECEPTORS IN THE CORNIA THE LUBRICATION OF THE CORNIA IS SUPPORTED BEYE BLINKING AND WHILE IT SEEMS A LITTLE SILLY SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY BENEFIT FROM DOING YOU KNOWSOME YOU KNON'T FIVE OR TEN OR FIFTEEN SECONDS OF BLINKING AND THEND DOING THEIR FOCUST WORK SOME PEOPLE THEIR EYES ARE DRYING OUT BECAUSE AS WE FOCUS IF WE'RE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING OUR EYELIDS STAY OPEN THE EYES CAN DRY OUT BUT IT ALSO CAN MAKE IT SUCH THAT WHEN WE BLINK THE NEXT TIME THERE'S A KIND OF A NEED TO FOCUS BECAUSE THERE'S SOME DISTORTIONS IN THE IN THESE OILS AND LIQUIDS A ACROSS THE CORNIAL SURFACE IF YOUR SOMEBODY WHO SUFFERS FROM DRY I DO HOPE THEY'LL FIND A A TREATMEN ORE A CURE FOR DRY EYE SOON THERE ISN'T ONE AT PRESENT SOME ONE STANDS TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY OUT THERE IF YOU CAN FIND A CURE FOR DRY EY UM LET THE COMPANIES KNOW OR START A COMPANY RAG NOW IT'S STILL A MYSTERY AS TO HOW TO DO THAT BUT BLINKING FOR FIVED FIFTEEN SECONDS PROBABLY SLOWLY NOT AS QUICKLY AS I'M DOING HERE ON VIDIO BUT JUSSEENA MAY BE A BLNK EVERY A SECOND OR TWO FIFTEEN SECONDS CAN LUBRICATE THE EYES AND THAT'S I'M NOT DIRECTLY RELATE TO ANYTHING NURL IS JUST GOIN ALLOW THE OPTICS OF YOUR EYE TO BE CLEAR JUST LIKE WHEN THE SCREEN OF YOUR PHONE GETS DIRTY LIKE WHEN COSTALL IS TEXTING ON MY PHON AND I PICK IT UP OIS LIKE COVERED WITH SMUCH TO CLEAN IT OFF AN ORDER TO SEE THINGS CLEARLY THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING FOR THESE OPTICAL DEVICES ON THE FRONT OF YOUR BRAIN REMEMBER THESE ARE BRAIN OKI SO LOT OF PROTOCALS TO DAY ALMOST ALL OF THEM UM BEHAVIORAL PROTOCALLS I DO WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT VISION AND HOW IT WORKS INTERNALLY AND THEN I ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE FOODS AND SUPPLEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO SUPPORT VISION AND OFFSET VISUAL LOSS AND MAYBEVEN REVERSE SOME VISUAL LOSS LET'S TALK ABOUT BINEOCULAR VISION AND LAZY EYE I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH LAZY EYE BECAUSE WHEN I WAS A KID I WENT SWIMMING ONE DAY ONE DAY AND I DIDN'T AT MY GOGGLES AND SO SOMETHING MUST HAVE BEEN HAPPENING AS I RECALL WITH THE EYE MOVING DOWN THROUGH THE WATER I'VE ALWAYS HAD THIS PROBLEM THAT I CAN ONLY DO THE FREE STYLE STROKE OFF TO ONE SIDE THE PEOPLE I SWOMENT ARE ALWAYS LAUGHING  SOMEHOW I I COT A MOVE TOWARD DROWNING WHEN I TRY AND BREATHE ON THE RIGHT SIDE I THINK THERES SOME A SYMMETRY IN THE WAY O ORGANIZED ANYWAY I WAS OFF TO MY LEFT AND MY EYE KEPT GOING IN AND OUT THE WATER AND THEREWAS CLOREENE IN THE WATER AND WAS MAKING IN COMFORABLES I JUST CLOSE MY EYE I DESIDETO YO NEW MORE OR LESS HAD TO SWIM STRAIGHT ISH AH MIGHT AV E BOUNCED OFF THE LANELINES A FEW TIMES BUT I JUST USE THE OTHER IYED O CONSTEER FOR THAT MARK ON THE WALL GOT OUT OF POOL O SHOWER DRY IT OFF AND THEN COMPLETELY LOST BY NOCULAR VISION FOR THREE DAYS COMPLETELY THE YOUNG BRAIN UP UNTIL ABOUT AGE SEVEN BUT MAYBE EVEN EXTENDING OUT UNTIL ABOUT AGE TWELVE IS EXTREMELY VULNERABLE TO DIFFERENCE IS IN OCULAR INPUT BETWEEN THE TWO EYES MY SCIENTIFIC GREAT GRANDPARENTS WON THE NOBOU PRIZE FOR DISCOVERING SO CALL CRITICAL PERIODS PERIODS OF TIME IN WHICH THE BRAIN IS MORE PLASTIC MORE ABLE TO CHANGE THOSE TWO GUIES DAVID HUWIL TORNS AN WEASA THANK YOU DAVID AND TORNSTON FOREVER CHANGE THE FACE OF VISUAL NI SINCE AND FOREVER CHANGE THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT TREATMENT OF THE YOUNG BRAIN IT USED TO BE THOUGHT THT YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO DO A SURGERY ON A YOUNG KID BECAUSE OF RISK OF VANISESIAND YOUNG INDIVIDUALS BUT WE NOW KNOW THAT YOU NEED TO REPAIR THESE EMBALANCES THAT EVEN A FEW HOURS I DONT WANT SCARE ANYBODY I'LL TALK ABOUT REVERSAL BUT A FEW HOURS OF A CLUDING ONE EYE EARLY IN LIYE CAN LEAD TO PERMANENT UNLESS SOMETHING'S DONE PERMANENT CHANGES IN THE WAY THAT THE BRAIN PERCEIVES THE OUTSIDE WORLD SUCH THAT WHEN THAT EYE IS OPENED UP AGAIN THE BRAIN ACTUALLY CAN'T MAKE SENSE OF ANYTHNG THAT'S COMING THROUGH IT IT SHUTS DOWN THAT VISUAL PATHWAY SOMEHOW SO WHAT HAPPEN TO ME WAS ACTUALLY WAS MY EYE WAS FINE I GOT OUT OF POOL I OPEN MY EYE BUT I COULDN'T SEE THROUGH THAT EYE EVERYTHING WAS BLURRY DOUBLE VISION UNLESS I COVERED THIS EYE AND THEN I COULD SEE PERFECTLY FINE FORTUNATELY WENT YOU AN UPTHEMALGUST WHO UNDER STOOD THE LITERATURE THANK YOU DOCTOR MARKED LEWRY WHO UNDERSTOOD THE LITERATURE AND MADE IT CLEAR THAT WHAT I NEEDED TO DO WAS TO A CLUDE THE OTHER EYE THE EYE THAT WAS WORKING VERY WELL CLEARLY HE UNDERSTOOD THE WORK OF FEU BONE WEASAL NOW AGAIN YOU DON'T WANT TO START PLAYING GAMES WITH THIS KINOFSTUFF WHEN YOU'RE A KID IF YOU WEAR LET SAY YOU HAVE A HALLOWEN COSTUME AND YOU WEAR AND EY PATCH OUR A PIRATE OR SOMETHING FOR HALLOWEN AND YOU COVER ED UP ON ONE SIDE PROBABLY FOR THE NIGHT OF HALLOWINE ITS OKET I DO NOT RECOMMEND DOING THAT RECREATIONALLY IF YOU DON'T NEED THAT IF YOUARE A YOUNG CHILD OR FOR YOUR CHILD TO DO THAT BECAUSE INDEED YOU CREATIN BALANCES IN THE BRAIN MACHINERY THE COMPARES INFORMATION COMING IN THROUGH THE TWO EYES AND IT CAN SHUT DOWN THE NERAL INFORMATION FOR THE ECCLUDED THE CLOSED EYE NOW I WAS ABLE TO REVERSE THIS ISSUE BUT MY BINOCULAR VISION HAS NEVER BEEN TERRIFIC I MUCH BETTER AT THE DARKBOARD AND STILL NOT VERY GOOD IF I CLOSE ONE EYE I MUCH BETTER AT THE POOL TABLE IF I CLOSES ONE EYE AND I STILL IN TERRIBLE I WAS THE KID AN IU KOW IN IN THE OUTFIELD YOUON THE BALLS COMING TOWARDS ME THE BALLS COMING TOWARD DOW TO CATCH THE BALLING LIKE A HIP ME SQUARE IN THE IN THE LIPTH I MY BINOCULAR VISION ISN'T GREAT AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS EARLY EVENT AND I HAVE A HARD TIME WITH THOSE A BINOCULAR STEREO GRAMS THOSE IMAGES THAT ARE KIND OF USELESS TO LOOK AT THEM AND THEN THE BINOCULAR DEPTH IMAGE LIKE POPS OUT ALL THE OTHER KIDS ARE GOING THERE'S THE WHATEVER THE STATUE LIBERTY THEREIS THE AMERIAN I SEE I SEE DOTS ISO I HAVE BYNOCULAR VISION BUT I USE OTHER CUES I USE THE NEAR FAR CUES THAT I TALKED ABOUT BEFORE MOTION PARALAX THE FACT THAT THINGS ARE CLOSER N WE ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THINGS FURTHER AWAY IN ORDER TO JUDGE DEPTH AND YEARS LATER WHEN I GOT INVOLVED IN AND I DON'T SUGGESTICE FOR MOST PEOPLE M I GOT INVALDAN BOXING A MARSHAL ORCHON WAS YOUNGER YOU U  SOMETIMES WILL SEE FIDERS THIS IS A SLIP TO AVOID GETTING PUNCH IT'S ALSO GENERATING MOTION PARALAX MANY ANIM OLS JUDGE DEPTH BY MOVING THEIR HEAD NOT BY USING OTHER MECHANISMS OF ACCOMMODATION IA SO A A LOT OF BIRDS AND MONKEYS AND ANIMALS WILL JUDGE DEPTH BY MOVING THEIR HEAD LIKE THIS OR THEY'LL MOVE FROM SIDE TO SIDE ANIMALS THAT WILL UNDULATE SOMETIMES ARE ACTUALLY DOING A DEPTH MEASUREMENT BECAUSE AS YOU MOVE FROM SIDE TO SIDE THE BRAIN IS ABLE TO DO THE MATH OF DEPTH SO WHAT IS THIS ALL MEAN IN TERMS OF PRODOCALS IF YOUARE A YOUNG PERSON DO YOUR BEST TO GET REALLY GOOD BYNOCULAR VISION NOT JUST AT LEVEL OF YOUR PHONE ORE YOUR TABLET BUT ALSO AT DISTANCE YOU WILL BUILD STRONG BINOCULAR VISUAL MACHINERY IN THE BRAIN AND AT THE LEVEL OF THE EYES IN THE EYE MUSCULATURE NOW IF YOUR SOMEBODY WHO DID HAVE AN ENCLUSION WHAT NEEDED IS TO COVER UP THE OTHER EYE TO CREATEN IN BALANCE SO THAT THE RWEAK EYE THE SO CALLED LAZY EYE THET SOMETIMES REFER TO HIS AMBLYOPIA THAT I HAS TO WORK HARDER SO FOR ME THEY PATCHED THIS OTHER EYE AND MADE THIS EE A VENSHI GOT VISION THROUGH THAT IVE ACT THAN THEY OPEN THEM BOTH UP NOW YOU MIGHT ASK WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU COVER BOTH EYES EARLY IN LIFE AND THIS WHERE IT GETS INTERESTING YOU MIGHT THINK WHILEF COVERING ONE EYE LEADS TO POOR VISION FOR THAT I AFTER  THAT EYE IS OPEN COVERING BOTH EYES PROUALLY MAKE YOU BLIND RIGHT ACTUALLY THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENS WHAT HUBLOON VEAZLL DISCOVERED IN WHAT'S BEEN AFFIRMED MANY MANY MORE TIMES OVER IN SUBSEQUENT STUDIES IS THAT IT'S COMPETIT IVE THAT THE TWO EYES ARE COMPETING FOR REAL ESTATE UP IN THE BRAIN SO IF YOU ACTUALLY COVER BOTH EYES YOU ACTUALLY EXTEND THE PERIOD OF THE CRITICAL OF CRITICAL PLASTICITY THIS IS A REALLY INTERESTING ASPECT THAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO LEVERAGE NOWLAN TERMSTHAT HAD A REOPEN PLASTICITY LATER IN LIFE BUT PLEASE DON'T YOU NOW GO ROUND WITH YOUR EYES COVERED FOR TWO LONG THERE ARE SOME LIKE RETREATS AND STUFF WORE PEOPLE GOING TO CAVES WITH ABSOLUTE NO VISION I CREATES HALLUCINATIONS WILL TALK ABOUT WHY THAT IS IN JUST A MOMENT BUT HERE'S MY SUGGESTION TRYING GET BALANCED VISUAL IN PUT THROUGH THE TWO EYES ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS A DOMINANT EYE IT USUALLY DOESN'T RELATE TO YOUR DOMINANT HAND ALTHOUGH IT CAN AND SO FOR ME IF I COVER UP MY RIGHT EYE I SEE MUCH LESS WELL MUCH MORE POORLY IT'S A LITTLE BIT FUZZY AND HAVE TO WORK HARDER IN ORDER TO SEE THE CAMERA FOR INSTANCE THAN IF I COVER UP MY LEFT EYE IT'S ASHALLY REALLY EASY FOR ME TO RELAX I HAVE A DOMINANT EYE YET YOU CAN BALANCE THAT OUT BY COVERING UP THE DOMINANT EYELIT OBIT EACH DAY BUT I WOULD WARN ANY YOUNG PEOPLE MEANING AH YOU TWELVE OR YOUNGER AGAINST CREATING THESE IN BALANCES IF THERE'S ISN'T A CLINICAL NEED TO DO THAT AND IF YOU DO HAVE STRONG IN BALANCES BETWEEN THE TO EYES WHICH CAN BE CAUSED BYE CATARACT AND LENDS ISSUES CAN BE I CAUSE BY NOR MUSCULAR ISSUES ET CETERA TO TRY AND GET THOSE DEALT WITH AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE BY CONTACTING A REALLY GOOD OPTHEMOLOGIS AN IDEALLY A NURW OPTHEMOLOGIS IT IS VERY NORMAL I SHOULD SAY IT'S VERY COMMON FOR YOUNG CHILDREN BABIS TO HAVE AN EYE THAT A WITH STRABISMEUS THAT EITHER DEVIATES OUT OR THAT DEVIATES IN IT IS IMPORTANT TO CORRECT THAT IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE BALANCED VISION BETWEEN THE TWO EYES AND FOR THE BRAIN TO RESPOND I EQUALLY TO THE TWO EYES IN TO HAVE A I WOULD SAY HIGH FIDELITY QUALITY VISION ALTHOUGH SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE A A EYE THAT DRIFTS CAN FUNCTION NORMALLY IN LIFE YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY EARLY IN LIFE TO RESCUE THAT I WON'T WELL MAYBE I WILL DO THIS BUT I CAN ACTUALLY RELAX THIS EE IT' SO WEAK IIN SOME CASES THAT IT ACTUALLY CAN START TO DEVIATE HOW JIST DO THIS HERE IT'S NOT COSSING EYE SO ACTUALLY CAN MOVE M I CAN MISSALINE MY EYES BECAUSE I HAVE TO FIGHT VERY HARD TO HAVE THE MUSCULATURE FOR THIS EYE A KEEP THAT EYE ALINED WITH THE OTHER EE AND THAT'S BECAUSE I'VE BEEN DOING EY EXERCISES SINCE I WAS IN MY TWENTIES CAUSE I NOTICE WHEN I WOULD STUDY A LOT THIS I WOULD START TO DRIFT IN ID START TO SEE DOUBLE IND I WAND THEN NEXT ENO AS JUST COVERING THE EYE UP IT WAS GETTING WEAKER AND WEAKER JUST LIKE THE ATROPHY OF A MUSCLE SO I WENT TO THE DOCTOR WHAT AD THEY DO THEY DID THE EXACT WRONG THING THE OPTOMATRIST I WENT TO GAVE ME A PRISM WHICH ADJUSTED IT SO THAT I COULD SEE THINGS NORMALLY WAS JUST MADE THE EYE WEAKER AND WEAKER IS LIKE PUTTING A WEAK ARM IN TO A SLING SO I HAD TO SPEND AT LEAST THREE YEARS OF TEN MINUTES A DAY IS WHAT I RECOMMEND DOING NEAR FAR COVERING UP MY GOOD EYE DOING NEAR FAR WITH MY BAD EYE AND NOW IT'S BEEN ABOUT TEN TWELVE YEARS THAT I HAVE PRETTY DECENT BY NOCULAR VISION NOW MANY OF YOU AREN'T DEALING WITH THIS A OR HAVE THESE EARLY CHILDHOOD ISSUES SOME OF YOU MIGHT BE EXPERIENCING CHALLENGES WITH FATIGUED EYES OR WHAT DIFFERENCES IN FOCUS WITH THE TWO EYES THESE I EXERCISES OF NEAR FAR SMOOTH PURSUIT AND CHECKING FOR FOR DOMINANT AND NONDOMINANT IYE CAN BE VERY BENEFICIAL I'M AGAIN I'M NOT A CLINATION SO I DON'T WANT TO YOU KNOW GIVE YOU PROTOCOLS ARE IN FORCED PROTOCALS ON ANYBODY YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S RIGHT AND SAFE FOR YOU GIVING YEUR VISION HISTORY I DO RECOMMEND TALKING TO A REALLY GOOD OPTHEMOLOGIST IF YOU HAVE SEVERE VISION PROBLEMS OF ANY KIND OR IF YOU WANT O OFFSET VISION PROBLEMS OF ANY KIND AND NOPTOMATRIST AS WELL BUT IDEALY WOULD BE A NURRW OTHEMOLOGIST O GET I DID MENTION HALLUCINATIONS AND A THEIR FUN TO TALK ABOUT AND THINK ABOUT  FOR YEARS PEOPLE OVE ASKED WHY DO PEOPLE GET VISUAL HALLUCINATIONS COSTELLS IN SLEEP RIGHT NOW YOU ROBABLY HAR HIM SNORING SNORING SO LAD ISPREATLY HAVING HALLUCINATIONS ABOUT RABBITS PIETS A AND A THOSE ARE MAINLY HIS FAVOUR THT AND SLEEP  HE IS DREAMING ABOUT SLEEP IN SLEEP HALLUCINATIONS ARE A PROPERTY OF THE VISUAL SYSTEM AND IT WAS ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT HALLUCINATIONS ARISE BECAUSE OF OVERACTIVATION OR ACTIVATION OF CERTAIN ASPECTS OF TE VISUAL SYSTEM I JUST BRIEFLY WANT A MENTION A PAPER THAT WAS PUBLISHED BY MY GOOD FRIEND AND PHENOMINAL A SCIENTIST AND PHYSICISTS FOR THAT MATTER CHRISCINEAL WHOS UP AT THE UNIVERSITY OF OREGON IN UGINE THEY STUDIED ELESTY LIKE COMPOUNDS AND DISCOVERED THAT HALLUCINATIONS ACTUALLY OCCUR BECAUSE PORTIONS OF YOUR BRAIN BECOME UNDERACTIVE THE VISUAL PORTIONS OF YHOUR BRAIN ARE UNDER STIMULATED THIS IS PROBABLY WHY WHEN PEOPLE GO INTO THESE CAVE RETREATS SOMETHING I'VE NEVER DONE A AND ONTHING I EVER WILL DO ORE IT'S COMPLETELY BLACK PRETTY SOON THEY START HALLUCINATING THEY START SEENG THINGS EVEN THUGH THERE'S NOTHING THERE THE VISUAL SYSTEM IS DESPERATE TO MAKE GUESSES ABOUT WHAT'S OUT IN THE WORLD IT'S LIKE THE EAGER BEAVER OF YOUR BRAIN IS LIKE WHAT'S OUT THERE WHAT'S OUT THERE WHAT'S OUT THERE EVEN IN LOW TO NO VISION PEOPLE BLIND PEOPLE THEY ARE THEIR BRAIN IS CON BE MAKING GUESSES ABOUT WHAT'S OUT THERE IN THE AUDITORY WORLD WHAT SOUNDS ARE THERE WHAT WHAT A TOUCH SENSATIONS ARE THERE FOR SIGHTED FOLKS IT'S GOING TO BE WHAT'S OUT THERE IN TERMS OF LIGHT LIGHT IS THE DOMINANT WAY VISION IS THE DOMINANT WAY THAT WE EVALUATE THE WORLD AROUND US SO IT TURNS OUT THAT HALLUCINATIONS ARE AN UNDERACTIVATION OF THE VISUAL SYSTEM AND THEN A COMPENSITORY A COMPENSATION BY WHICH THE VISUAL SYSTEM CREATES ACTIVITY AND HALLUCINATIONS SOPFERE IN THE DARK LONG ENOUGH YOU START TO HALLUCINATE AND SEE THINGS SO THAT'S A LITTLE NOTE ABOUT  HALLUCINATIONS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO TO IMPROVE YOUR VISION AND IT'S ALSO KIND OF FUN IS TO PUT A SNELL IN CHART IN YOUR HOME A SNELL IN CHART IS THAT LIST OF LETTERS ORD IF YOU GO TO THE DREADED DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES I SHOM UP FOR RENEWAL SOON SO LOVE THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTE OR VEHICLES I HAVE YOU COVER UP AN EYE READ THE THE LETTERS ON THE CHART  LETTERS OF COURSE GET SMALLER AND SMALLER THEY TRUN A FIGURE OUT ROUGHLY WHAT YOUR VISION IS COVER UP THE OTHER EYE YOU'LL DO THAT SOME PEOPLE INCLUDING NURTY VISION SCIENTISTS LIKE ME HAVE HAD SNELL IN CHARTS IN THEIR OFFICE OR IN THEIR HOME UP FOR MANY YEARS NOW AND YOU CAN JUST PRACTICE AND YOU CAN SEE HOW YOU'R DOING SITTING AT A PARTICULAR DISTANCE YOUR THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S NOT OFTEN MENTION BUT YOUR PERFORMANCE ON THE SNELL AND CHART WILL VERY DEPENDING ON TIME OF DAY BECAUSE YOU'R LEVEL OF FATIGUE IND YOUR ABILITY TO CONTROL THAT ACCOMMODATION AND OTHER MECHANISMS OF THE EYEMUSCLES WILL VERY SO YOU CAN TAKE IT AS AN AVERAGE IT'S ALSO A GOOD THING IF YOURE GIN TO GET YOUR VISION TESTED FOR CORRECTIVE LENSES OR OR MAYBE ARE GING TO LAZER SIRGE OR OUR SOMETHING THAT SORT YOU THINKING ABOUT ANY OF THAT TO REALLY GET IT MEASURED BY PROFESSIONAL THE ONES THAT YOU GET IN THOSE SUPERMARKETS ARE ON OR IN MANY EYEGLASS STORES APOLOGIES TO THE EYEGLASS DORES ARE OFTEN WRONG BY AN ORDER OF MAGNETAH AND THEN WHEN YOU START PUTTING CORRECTIVE LENSES ON THAT ARE OVERCORRECTING OR UNDER CORRECTING BUT MORE OFTEN ARE OVERCORRECTING THEN YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY WEAKENING THE SYSTEM IT'S LIKE PUTTING A PROSTHETIC ON A LIMB THAT YOU DIDN'T NECESSARILY NEED OR PROT OR A ROBOT ARM WHEN YOU DIDN'T NEED THE USE OF THE ROBOT ARM ALTHOUGH ON NOW THERE SO MUCH EXCITEMENT ABOUT ROBOTS I THINKPEOPLE ARE GO ME DOING THAT ANYWAY NONE THE LESS GET YOUR VISION TESTED BY SOMEBODY WHO REALLY UNDERSTANDS VISION LIKE AN OPTHEMOLOGIST OR REALLY GOOD OPTOMATRIST IF YOU PUT A SNELL IN CHART IN YOUR HOME YOU KNOW YOU CAN DO THAT AS PART OF YOUR VISUAL TRAINING NOW THIS MIGHT SEEM EXCESSIVELY NURTY BUT WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR EYESIGHT RIGHT EYESIGHT IS SO VITAL IT'S RIGHT UP THERE WI THE MOVEMENT AND OUR ABILITY TO MOVE TO GENERATE TO GET UP OUT OF CHAIRS AN TO WALK INTO RUN INTO TO TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES EYESIGHT AND MOVEMENT ARE THE MAIN WAYS THAT WE ARE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF OURSELVES AND TAKE CARE OF OTHERS WHEN YOU START HAVING COMPROMISE EYESIGHT OR COMPROMISE MOVEMENT PEOPLE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF US AND WE BECOME MUCH MORE CHALLENGE IN MOVING THROUGH OUR DAILY LIFE SO WHIL IT MIGHT SEEM NURTY TO HAVE A SNELL IN CHART IN YOUR HOME OR TO DO A SMOOTH PURSUIT EXERCISE A COUPLE TIMES A WEEK OR TO GET OUTSIDE FOR A FEW HOURS A DAY AND DO YOUR READING YOUR LAP TOP WORK THERE PRESERVING YOUR EYESIGHT AND PRESERVING YOUR VISION IS ONE OF THE MOST LIFE ENHANCING OR QUALITY OF LIFE INHANCING THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO AND IF YOU ARE YOUNG PERSON AND YOU CAN BUILD SOME OF THIS INTO YOUR FRAMEWORK OF EXERCISE OR BRAIN TRAINING IF YOU WANT TO CALL AT THAT THAT CAN BE IMMENSELY BENEFICIAL WIRL REALLY SET YOU UP TO HAVE REALLY GOOD VISION OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME NOW OF COURSE THEIARE GYMNETIC FACTORS AND THERE ARE INJURY RELATED FACTORS THAT CAN COMPROMISE EYESIGHT IN OUR ABILITY TO SEE AND OF COURSE THIS IS THE THINGS I'M TALKING ABOUT TODAY AREN'T CAN ASSOLVE ALL THOSE ISSUES BUT THEY CAN HAVE A TREMENDOUS POSITIVE IMPACT IF YOU ARE WILLING TO DO JUST A LITTLE BIT OF WORK AND NONE OF THIS IS INVOLVING ANY COST RISES JUST TIME COST SO I WANT I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT A FEW OTHER THINGS THAT CAN  A PERHAPS IMPROVE VISION I WANT O DISPEL A FEW MYTHS ABOUT STUFF TO TAKE TO IMPROVE VISION AND THEN I WANT TO JUST CLOSHES BY TALKING ABOUT HOW WE PERCEIVE TIME USING ARE VISION BECAUSE THAT WILL NICELY SET THE STAGE FOR WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT NEXT EPISODE SO NOW YOU UNDERSTAND A LOT ABOUT THE BIOLOGY OF VISION YOU UNDERSTAND THAT LIGHT HAS TO ARRIVE AT THE RETNU AND GET CONVERTED INTO ELECTRICAL SIGNALS THAT PROCESS REQUIRES THINGS LIKE VIDOMANEE A FAT SOLUBLE VIEMENT IT REQUIRES THINGS LIKE THE CORRATINOIDS THAT METABOLIC CASCATE THAT BOUT CHEMICAL CASCADE IS ESSENTIAL FOR VISION AND THIS IS WHY YOU'VE BEEN TOLD THAT CARROTS HELP YOU SEE BETTER DOES THER HIGH INVITOMANEE THERE ARE FEW SIMPLE THINGS YOU CAN DO TO SUPPORT YOUR VISION FIRST OF ALL IT IS TRUE THAT EATING VEGETABLES THE DARK LEAFY VEGETABLES AND THINGS LIKE CARROTS THAT HAVE VIDOMANEE IN ABUNDANCE AND EATING THEM IN CLOSE TO THEIR RAW FORM SO NATURALLY OCCURRING FOODS THAT CONTAIN A LOT OF VIDEMANEE IN THERE RAW FORM CAN HELP SUPPORT VISION NOW DOES THAT MEAN THAT IF YOU INJEST SUPERPHYSIOLOGICAL AMOUNTS OF THAT STUFF THAT ITS CAN MAKE YOUR VISION THAT MUCH BETTER NO BUT YOU DO NEED A THRESHOLD LEVEL OF VIDEMANEE IN ORDER TO SEE AND INTO ORDER TO SEE WELL NOW THERE'S A LOT OF EXCITEMENT NOWADAYS ABOUT SUPPLEMENTATION TO HELP SUPPORT THE HEALTH OF THE VISUAL SYSTEM AND I 'M SOMEBODY WHOSE PRETTY OPEN TO NOVEL FORMS OF SUPPLEMENTATION YOU PROTLY GATHERE THAT IF YOU'VE BEEN LOSSING THIS PODCAST FOR A WHILE HAVE TO DETERMINE WHAT SAFE AND ECONOMICAL AND RIPE FOR YOU WHAT YOUR RISK TOLERANCIS ET CETERA BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT A MOLECULE THAT IN A LOT OF SUPPLEMENTS TO SUPPORT VISION AND THERE ARE SOME REALLY GOD DATA ON AND THAT'S LUTINE NOW THE STUDY I WANTO DESCRIBE IS ACTUALLY PUBLISHED IN TWENTY SIXTEIN IT'S FROM THE JOURNAL OF OPTHEMOLOGY ITS  ITS A GOOD JOURNAL AND THE TITLE OF THIS PAPER IS A MIGHT CATCH YOUR ATTENTION IT'S INCREASED MACULAR PIGMEN OPTICAL DENSITY THAT US MEANS THAT THE MACULA IS AN AN AIRY OF THE I FOR CENTUAL VISION FOR HIGHACUITY VISION A PIGMAN DENSITY THERE IS GOOD YOU WANT PIGMENT THERE INCREASED MACULAR PIGMEN OPTICAL DENSITY AND VISUALACUITY VISUALCUITY IS YOURABILITY O SEE THINGS IN FIN DETAIL FALLOWING CONSUMPTION OF A BUTTERMILK DRINK CONTAINING LOUTINE ENRICHED EG YOKES REMEMBER RAW FOOTS LOUTINE ENRICH EG YOKES SOMETHING AROCKI MOVI OR HE WOULD DRINK THE REAI RAWA YOKES A RANDUMIZED DOUBLE BLIND PLACIBOT CONTROLLED TRIAL NOW I'M NOT SUGGESTING GO OUT AND EAT RAW EG YOKS THERE'S THE RISK OF SALMANILA ALTHOUGH I DID HEAR THIS SOME ONE CREPT ME FFOM RON THAT THE SALMANILA IS ACTUALLY ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE EGG NOT ACTUALLY IN THE EGG ITSELF IT'S ON THE SHELL FOR A REASONS THAT RELATE TO HOW THAT EGG GOT INTO THE WORLD AM THAT'S WHERE THE SALMANILA LIVES BUT A I COULD BE WRONG ABOUT THAT BUT RAI YOKES ARE NOT SOMETHING THAT MOST PEOPLE WANT A CONSUME WHAT IS THIS LOUTINE STUFF WHAT LOUTINE IS IN THE PATHWAY THAT RELATES TO VITEMEN A AND THE FORMATION OF THE OPSIN THE PHOTOPIGMENT THAT CAPTURES LIGHT IN THE BACUR EY LITERALLY ABSORBS LIGHT PIGMENT IN YOUR EYE AND CONVERTS THAT INTO ELECTRICAL SIGNALS AND ALLOWS YOU TO SEE AND THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE I SPOKE TO OUR CHAIR OF OPTHEMOLOGY THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THROUGH QUALITY PERVUED STUDIES THAT SUPPLEMENTING WITH LOUTINE CAN HELP OFFSET SOME OF THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS OF AGE RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION BUT I WANT EPHASIZE BUT REMASIZE HOWEVER ONLY FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE MACULAR DEGENERATION FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE NORMAL VISION OR WITH A JUST A LOW DEGREE OF MACULA DEGENERATION THESE STUDIES DID NOT SEE A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OF VISION FROM SOUMPLEMENTING WITH LOUTINE SO I'M NOT GON TO TELL YOU TO SUPPLEMENT WITH LOUTINE OR NOT I DON'T THINK ANY STUDY IS WHOLLY BUT IT DOES SEEM THAT IF YOU HAVE MODERATE TO SEVERE MACULAR DEGENERATION TALK YOUR PHYSICIAN OF COURSE TOP TOYOUROPTHEMOLOGISTS I'LL ALWAYS SAY THAT AND I'LL SAY AT THREE TIMES SUPPLEMENTING WITH LUTINE COULD PERHAPS SUPPORT VISION AND OFFSET SOME VIS LOSS IN THAT CASE PROBABLY ALSO TALK TO YOUR OPTHEMOLOGIST OR CONSIDER THE RED LIGHT THERAPY THAT IS TAL KED ABOUT EARLIER WHEREAS IF YOU HAVE NORMAL VISION OR A LO AMOUNT OF MACULARE DEGENERATION IT DOES NOT SEEM AT LEAST FROM THESE STUDIES THAT LUTINE HOW MUCH OF AN EFFECT NOW I KNOW AN I CONFESS I'M SORT OF OF THE MIND THAT IF I PERSONALLY HAD A RELAY IMACULAE DEGENERATION OR PROPENSITY FOR IT IN MY FAMILY WHICH FORTUNALY I DON'T BUT IN THAT CASE I WOULD THINK THAT SUPPLEMENTING WITH LUTINE PROVIDED IT SAFE COULD PERHAPS BE OF BENEFITING MY ONE O CONSIDER A LOW DOSE OF THAT SO AGAIN I'M NOT PUSHING ANY OF THIS ON ANYBODY A BY ANY MEANS BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS OF SEVERE MACULA DEGENERATION OR MODERATE MACULAR DEGENERATION IT DOES SEEM LIKE LUTINE CAN BE BENEFICIAL IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE CONSUMED THROUGH RAW EG YOKES ALTHOUGH THAT IS THE HIGHEST DENSITY SOURCE COOKING THE EGG  COOKING YOUR EGGS IF YOU LIKE YOUR SCRAMBLE LEGS DRY OR YOU LIKE YOUR EGGS A NOT A EAS OVER WHATEVER NOT RUNNY THEN YOU AREN'T GOING TO GET THE BENEFITS OF THE LUCINE THERE ARE OTHER SOURCES OF LUCINE NON ANIMAL SOURCES OF LUCINE AS WELL YOU CAN LOOK THOSE UP ON THE INTERNET NOW THERE ARE OTHER COMPOUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO PERHAPS BE IMPORTANT FOR OFFSETTING OR HELPING DIFFERENT FORMS OF VISION LOST ONE IS AMAN A SPELL HIS OUT I D  B  N OEN IN DEBONE IN DE BENNON IN DE BENON I CAN NEVER PRONOUNCE THESE COMPOUNDS FORGIVE ME AM UNLESS IHAVE WORKED WITH THEM A THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT IT CAN BE BENEFICIAL FOR LEBERS CONGENERAL I DISEASE A I WOULD DEFINLLY GO ON TO EXAMINED OT COM PUT IN I D  B N OANI AND FOR THINGS LIKE LEBERS OPTICAL A OPTIC NEROPATHIES WHICH IS A DEGERNER OF CONDITION OF THE EYE WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE SHOULD JUST BE TAKING THE STUFF ANYWAY IS STILL AN OPEN QUESTION THERE AREN'T A LOT OF STUDIES ABOUT IT A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE INTERESTED IN TAKING THINGS TO SUPPORT THEIR VISION ARE TAKING LUTINE AS A PREVENTATIVE MEASURE I DON'T PASS ANY JUDGEMENT ONE WEY OR THE OTHER TYPICALLY THOSE SUPPLEMENTS ALSO INCLUDE THE Z AXITHINS AND THE ASTE AXONS OKA THE PRONUNCIATION THIS IS IS TERRIBLE I'M SURE BUT THAT'S NOT TOO FAR OFF BUT BASICALLY Z E A X A N T H I N N SEE WIDES ARE PRONOUNCE Z A X A N T H I N AND THE OTHER ONE IS A S T A X A N T H I N BOTH OF THESE HAVE BEEN SHOWN MEXCUSE ME BOTH OF THESE HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO OFFSET SOME OF THE DESRUPTION IN VISION THAT OCCURS WITH AGION WHAT IS ASTAX AXON S REALLY INTERESTING COMPOUND IT'S THE RED PINK PIGMENT FOUND IN VARIOUS SEA FOODS SOME SHRIMP I'M NOT A BIG SEFOOD FAN BUT LUT CERTAIN FISH LIKE THE YOU'LL SEE THE FISH MARKET WILL HAVE THAT RED PINK PIGMENT AND ITS ALSO IN THE FEATHERS OF FLEMINGOS PLEASE DON'T EAT THE FEATHERS OF FLEMINGOS AND PLEASE ALSO DON'T EAT FLEMINGOES IT STRUCTURELY SIMILAR TO BATE A CEROTINE SO IT'S VERY PRPROVIDEMANE BUT IT HAS SOME CHEMICAL DIFFERENCES WHICH MAY MAKE IT SAFER THAN VIDEMONE REMEMBER VIDEMONE IS A LIPID SOLUBLE VIDEMEN SO IT CAN BE STORED IN OUR BODY FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH THIS ASACTAN YEND WHAT ARE ITS DRAWBACKS WELL WE CAN GO TO OUR EVER FAVOR EXAMINED OT COM WHAT IES IT DO WELL IT HAS A NUMBER OF DIFFEREN EFFECTS A HUGE NUMBER IN FACT BUT IT DOES SEEM TO NOTABLY INCREASE IT'S NOW BEEN SHOWN IN THREE STUDIES THE ANTIOXIDAN ENDZIM PROFILE IT HAS A NUMBER DIFFRENT EFFECTS BUT THE MOST NOTABLE FOR SAKE OF THIS EPISODE IS THE ONE ON OCULAR BLOOD FLOW IT DOES SEEM TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF OCULAR BLOOD FLOWS TAT THE BLOOD SUPPLY TO THE EYES THAT MAKES AN INTERESTING COMPOUND AS NUMBER OF OTHER EFFECTS FOR WHATEVER REASON IT ALSO HAS A NOTABLE EFFECT SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE SHOWNNESS ON FERTILITY IN MALES SO IT SEEMS TO AT LEAST DOUBLE THE PREGNANCY RATE A WHEN MEN TAKE ASTAXANTAN AM AND WORKS IS IN PARTICULAR IT SEEMS HERE IN MEN THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY IN FERTIL SO IT I DON'T NOW IF THAT HAS SOMETHING DO WITH THE BLOOD FLOW TO THE EYES PROBABLY NOT PROBLY HASE SOMETHING ANDO WITH SOMETHING UNRELATED TO THE EYES NONE THE LESS THAT'S AN EFFECT OF THIS MOLECULE IT'S ALSO BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE POSIVE EFFECTS ON THINGS LIKE SKIN ELASTICITIE SKIN MOISTURE SKINQUALITY ET CETERA PROBABLY DUE TO ITS EFFECTS ON BLOOD FLOW SO LUTINE AEDACON IT HAS T E AXA AND T E GIN AND FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT LEBERS OP OPTINEROPTIES WHICH IS THT GON T BE SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE OUT THERE BUT THAT IS A PRETTY SEVERE CONDITION THERE ARE SUPPLEMENTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE OUT THERE I DO ENCOURAGE YOU AS ALWAYS TO TALKTURE OPTHOMOLOGIST AND PHYSICION ABOUT THEM AND I WILL SAY THAT THERE ARE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT TAKE LUTINE AND SOME OF THESE OTHER THINGS AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE AT IN ORDER TO BOLSTER THEIR HEALTH IN THE SAME WAY THAT SOME PEOPLE TAKE VITEMENS AND MINERALS TO BOLSTER THEIR HEALP AND SOME PEOPLE ARE VERY HEALTH SCUSE ME AND SOME PEOPLE ARE VERY OF VERSE TO TAKE INVITEMENTS AND MINERALS CAS THEY FEEL LIKE THEY CAN GET ALL THAT FROM HEALTHY WHOLE FOODS AND OF COURSE YOU CAN GET THESE THINGS FROM AFROM WHOLE FOODS THE QUESTION IS WHETHER NOT YOU CAN GET THEM IN CONCENTRATIONS THAT ARE SUFFICIENT I DO THINK THAT IN THE YEARS TO COME WE ARE GOING TO SEE MORE ABOUT LOUTINE I AM I THINK WE ARE GOING TO SEE MORE ABOUT SOME OF THESE OTHER COMPOUNDS LIKE ASTAXACXAN AND HOPEULY BY THEN I'LL BEHABLE TO PRONOUNCE IT BUT AT PRESENT THESE THINGS ARE MORE OR LESS IN THE KIND OF EXPERIMENTAL OR SELF EXPERIMENTAL PHASE THERE ARE SOME GOOD DOUBLE BLIND POSSIPLE CONTROL STUDIES LIKE THET EGYO BUTTERMILK STUDY OF OF ALL THINGS PUBLISHED AND REALLY GOOD JOURNALS JOURNAL OF OPTHEMOLOGY JOURNAL A INVESTIGATIVE OPTOMOLOGY IND VISION SCIENCES TH ESE ARE THESE ARE GOOD JOURNALS THESE ARE JOURNALS THEIRE PURE REVIEWED BY EXPERTS AM THE STUDY THAT I MENTION EARLIER ABOUT KEEPING ROOMS DARK AH THAT

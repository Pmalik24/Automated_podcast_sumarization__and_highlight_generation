WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LANCONCANS  US SCIENCE SCIENCE TACE TOOAN FORLIF  I MA OUR HUBERMEN AND I'M A PROFESSOR OF NEUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY WE ARE DISCUSSING COLDS AND FLUES WE WILL TALK ABOUT WHAT A COLD REALLY IS AND WHAT A FLUE REALLY IS IN TERMS OF HOW THEY IMPACT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY AND OF COURSE WE WILL DISCUSS HOW TO AVOID GETTING COLDS AN FLUES THERE ARE INDEED SOME EXCELLENT SCIENCE SUPPORTED TECHNIQUES TO AVOID GETTING COLDS AN FLUES BUT OF COURSE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPLETELY AVOID EVER GETTING A COLDER FLUE IN YOUR LIFETIME SO WE ALSO DISCUSS HOW TO MORE QUICKLY GET OVER A COLDER FLUE SHOULD YOU HAPPEN TO CATCH ONE SO DURING TO DAYS DISCUSSION I'LL TALK ABOUT THE IMMUNE SYSTEM I'LL GIVE YOU SOME MECHANISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF HOW YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM WORKS AND I PROMISE TO MAKE THAT DISCUSSION ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYBODY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT YOU HAVE A BACKGROUN AND BIOLOGY AND WITH THAT UNDERSTANDING OF HOW YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM WORKS YOU WILL BE IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION TO UNDERSTAND WHICH TOOLS THAT IS WHICH PROTOCALS TO IMPLEMENT SHOULD YOU BE EXPOSED TO A COLDER FLUE OR IF YOU ARE TRYING TO GET OVER A COLDER FLUE MORE QUICKLY THAN YOU WOULD OTHERWISE YOU'LL LEARN ABOUT SOME POTENT BEHAVIORAL TOOLS FOR BOLSTERING YOURIMUNE SYSTEM AND WE WILL ALSO DISCUSS VARIOUS COMPOUNDS THAT YOU MIGHT CONSIDER TAKING TO ENHANCE THE FUNCTION OF URMUNE SYSTEM TO WARD OFF OR TREAT COLDS AN FLUES I WILL ALSO BE DISPELLING A NUMBER OF COMMON MYTHS ABOUT TREATMENTS FOR THE COMMON COLD AND FOR THE FLUE THERE ARE OWE SO MANY IDEAS OUT THERE ABOUT WHAT ONE COULD TAKE OR DO IN ORDER TO AVOID GETTING THE OLDER FLUE OR MORE QUICKLY GET RELIEF FROM A COLDER FLUE HOWEVER MANY OF THOSE ARE PURE MYTH THERE'S JUST NO SCIENCE TO SUPPORT THEM AN INDEED THEIR SOME SCIENCE THAT COUNTERS THOSE IDEAS BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THERE ARE INDEED SCIENCE SUPPORT O BEHAVIOR O PROTOCALS AND COMPOUNDS THAT ONE COULD CONSIDER IN ORDER TO AVOID ENTREAT COLDS IN FLUES BEFORE YOU BEGIN I LIKE EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARAT FROM MY TEACHING IN RESEARTROLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRON EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I LIKE TO THANK THE SPONCERS OF TO DAY'S POTCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS JUWE JUVE MAKES MEDICAL GRADE RED LIGHT THEROPE DEVICES NOW THERE'S ONE THING I'VE CONSISTENTLY EMPHASIZE ON THIS PODCAST IT'S THE INCREDIBLE ROLL THAT LIGHT CAN HAVE ON OUR BIOLOGY OF COURSE I'M ALWAYS TELLING PEOPLE THAT THEY SHOULD GET SUNLIGHT IN THEIR EYES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER WAKING ON AS MANY DAYS OF THEIR LIFE AS POSSIBLE FOR SAKE OF SETTING CIRKATING RHYTHM DAYTIME MOODFOKIS AN ALERTNESS AND IMPROVE SLEEP NOW IN ADDITION TO SUNLIGHT RED LIGHT AND NEAR INFRED LIGHT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE POSSIVE EFFECTS ON IMPROVING NUMEROUS ASPECTS OF CELLER AND ORGAN HEALTH INCLUDING FASTER MUSCLE RECOVERY IMPROVED SKIN HEALTH AND WOUND HEALING EVEN IMPROVEMENTS IN ACNEY OR THAT IS REMOVAL OF ACNE REDUCING PAIN AND INFLAMMATION IMPROVING MY TA CONJURAL FUNCTION AND EVEN IMPROVING VISION ITSELF WHAT SET SHUVE APART AND WHY IT'S MY PREFERRED RED LIGHT THERAPY DEVICE IS THAT IT HAS CLINICALLY PROVIN WAVELANGS MEANING IT USES SPECIFIC WAVELINGTS OF RED LIGHT AND NEARIM FRED LIGHT INCOMBINATION THAT TRIGGER THE OPTIMAL SELLAR ADAPTATIONS PERSONALLY I USE THE HANDHEL JUVE EVERY DAY THE HANNEL JUVIS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A THICK PIECE OF TOAST AND I ALSO OWN A JUVE PANEL THAT ALLOWS FOR FULL BODY EXPOSURE AND I USE THAT ONE APPROXIMATELY FIVE TIMES FOR WEEK FOR ABOUT TEN TO FIFTEEN MINUTES PERCESSION IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY JUVE YOU CAN GO TO JUVE SPELLED J O O V V DOC COM SLASH HUBERMAN AGAIN THAT'S JUVE DOC

I'VE SPENT A LIFETIME WORKING ON THE BIOLOGY THE VISUAL SYSTEM I CAN TELL YOU THAT YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM HAS TO CONTEND WITH AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF CHALLENGES IN ORDER FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO SEEK CLEARLY ROCA UNDERSTANDS THOSE CHALLENGES AND HAS DESIGNE THEIR EYEGLASSES AND SUNGLASSES ACCORDINGLY SO THAT YOU ALWAYS SEE WITH CRYSTAL CLARITY ROCA EYE GLASSES AND SUNGLASSES ARE DESIGNED WITH A NEW TECHNOLOGY CALLED FLOAT FIT WHICH ALLOWS THEM TO FIT PERFECTLY AND NOT MOVE AROUND EVEN WHEN YOU'RE ACTIVE IN FACT WHENEVER I'M WEARING MY ROCA EYEGLASSES OR SUNGLASSES I USUALLY FORGET THAT I'M WEARING THEM I HAPPEN TO WEAR ROCA EYE GLASSES AT NIGHT WHEN I DRIVE OR IF I'M READING AT NIGHT AND I WEAR ROCA SUNGLASSES DURING THE DAYTIME IF IT'S VERY BRIGHT ESPECIALLY FROM DRIVING INTO SUNLIGHT

DOK COM AND ENTER THE CODE HUBERMAN AT CR ECOUT OKA LET'S TALK ABOUT THE COMMON COLD FIRST OFF NO UNFORTUNATELY TODAY I CANNOT TELL YOU THE CURE FOR THE COMMON COLD BECAUSE INDEED THERE ISN'T ONE ONE INTERESTING QUESTION HOWEVER IS WHY DON'T WE HAVE A CURE FOR THE COMMON COLD AND THE REASON IS THAT THE COLD VIRUS AS IT'S REFERRED TO IS ACTUALLY A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT VIRUSES SOME COLDS ARE CAUSED BY ONE WHAT'S CALLED SEROTYPE OF THE VIRUS OTHER COLDS ARE CAUSED BY A DIFFERENT CEROTYPE OF THE VIRS THERE ARE OVER ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DIFFERENT TYPES OF WHAT PEOPLE CALL THE COLD VIRUS NOW COLD VIRUSES FALL UNDER AN UMBRELLA OF A GENERAL CATEGORY OF VIRUS IS CALLED RHINO VIRUS AS YOU CAN REMEMBER THAT EASILY BECAUSE RHINO SOUNDS LIKE VINO SHORN THE RHINOCEROUS HORN WHICHES OF COURSE IN THE CENTER OF THE RINO'S FACE WHICH IS WHEARE YOUR NOSE IS AND THE COLD ALMOST ALWAYS CAUSES SOME DEGREE OF NAZAL SYMPTOMS IN HUMANS S EITHER RUNNY NOSE OR SNEEZING OR STUFFED UP NOSE OR SOMETIMES UNFORTUNATELY ALL THREE NOW THE REASON WE DON'T HAVE A CURE FOR THE COMMON COLD IS THAT ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT SEROTYPES OF THE COLD VIRUS MEAN THAT THE VIRUS ITSELF HAS A IFFERENT SHAPE ON ITS OUTSIDE AND AS A CONSEQUENCE EVEN IF YOU'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO A COLD AND YOU'VE DEVELOPED ANTIBODIES AGAINST THAT COLD VIRUS THE NEXT COLD THAT COMES ALONG VERY LIKELY HAS A DIFFERENT SHAPE AND THEREFORE YOURE BODIES ANTIBODIES TO THE COLD VIRUS IT COMBATED SUCCESSFULLY BEFORE CAN'T LATCH ON TO AND DEFEAT THAT NEXT DIFFERENT CROTYPE OF THE COLD VIRUS NOW LUBIT LATER OUT TALK ABOUT THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND HOW THOSE DIFFERENT ANTIBODIES ARE GENERATED BUT FOR THE TIME BEING UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF COLD VIRUSES EXPLAIN FIRST OF ALL WHY WE DON'T HAVE A CURE FOR THE COMMON COLD BUT ALSO WHY YOU CAN GET MULTIPLE COLDS WITHIN A GIVEN YEAR OR EVEN WITHIN A GIVEN SEASON BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU DEVELOP ANTIBODIES AGAINST ONE CEROTYPE OF THE COLD VIRUS A DIFFRENT CEROTYPE CAN COME ALONG AND YOU CAN GET SICK AGAIN WITH THAT NEW CERAOTYPE OF THE COLD VIRUS SO HOW D YOU CATCH A COLD NOW ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE COLD VIRUS BEING COLD THE COLD VIRUS AND THE FACT THAT INDEED THERE ARE MORE COLD VIRUS IS PRESENT AND TRANSMITTED BETWEEN HUMANS IN THE COLD WINTER MONTHS OF THE YEAR IS THAT PEOPLE GENERALLY ASSUME THAT IT IS THE COLD TEMPERATURES OUTSIDE THAT ACTUALLY GIVE YOU A COLD VIRUS AND THAT IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE HOWEVER WHAT YOU HEARD ISICATED IF YOUARE MOM MOST LIKELY BUT MAYBOR DAD SAID EY DON'T GO OUTSIDE WITHOUT A SWEATER OR JACKET ON YOU'RE GOING TO CATCH A COLD ARE YOU GOING TO CATCH COLD YOU KNOW HAS PROPAGATED THIS A THE MYTH THAT THE COLD TEMPERATURES THEMSELVES ARE THE CAUSE OF CATCHING A COLD VIRUS AND THAT'S SIMPLY NOT TRUE THE VIRUS THAT WE CALL THE COLD VIRUS IS SPREAD BY BREATHING OR BY SNEEZING OR BY PEOPLE SNEEZING OR COUGHING OR BREATHING ON TO THEIR HANDS AND THEN TOUCHING SURFACES AND THEN OTHER PEOPLE TOUCHING THOSE SURFACES AND THEN TOUCHING MOST LIKELY THEIR EYES IN ORDER TO SELF IN FACT NW WE'RE GOING TO GET INTO THE DETAILS OF HOW F ARE THE VIRUS CAN SPREAD WITH A SNEEZE HOW LONG IT CAN SURVIVE ON THE HANDS ET CETERA BUT FOR THE TIME BEING KNOW THIS THE COLD VIRUS IS A PRETTY STABLE VIRUS IN THAT IT CAN SURVIVE ON SURFACES NON HUMAN OR HUMAN SURFACES MEANING SKIN OR ON A TABLE OR ON A GLASS OR ON A DOOR HANDLE FOR UP TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS SO FOR ALL YOU HYPOCHONDRIACTS OUT THERE I PROBABLY JUST GAVE YOU LITTLE SPIKE IN CARTISALL AND FOR YOU NON HYPOCONDRACTS I HOPE WHAT I JUST SAID CUSE YOU TO THE FACT THAT JUST AVOIDING PEOPLE WHO ARE SNEEZING AND COUGHING IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO AVOID GETTING COLDS IN FLUES HOWEVER THE FACT THAT A COLD VIRUS IS ALIVE AND WELL ON A GIVEN SURFACE LET' SAY ON A DOOR HANDLE DOES NOT MEAN THAT IF YOU TOUCH THAT DOOR HANDLE THAT YOU WILL NECESSARILY BE INFECTED WITH THAT COLD VIRUS AND THAT'S BECAUSE YOUR SKIN I SHAL PROVIDES IN EXCELLENT BARRIER AGAINST MOST VIRUSES IN BACTERIA YOUR SKIN ALSO INCLUDES A LOT OF ANTI VIRAL SUBSTANCES ON IT EVEN IF YOU HAVEN'T PUT ANY OF THAT YOU KNOW ALCOHOL STUFF FOR THE HAND SANITIZ OR STUFF ON YOUR SKIN IS AF VERY IMPORTANT BARRIER COMPONENT OF YOUR EMMUNE SYSTEM OR GAN TO TALK ABOUT THAT ELOBIT LATER BUT IF SOMEBODY HAS A COLD IN THE HAPPITO PERHAPS YOU KNO WHIPE THEIR NOSE OR SNEEZE INTO A TISSUE HOEFULLY INTO A TISSUE AND THEN DISCARD THAT TISSUE THE COLD VIRUS PARTICLES ARE EXTREMELY SMALL HOW SMALL WELL MOST OF US ARE FAMILIAR WITH THINKING ABOUT SENTIMETERS OR INCHES IF YOU THINK ABOUT A MILLIMETER BEING ONE ONE HUNDREDTH OF A CENTIMETER WELL YOU CAN TAKE A MILLIMETER AND YOU CAN DIVIDE THAT UP INTO A BUNCH OF LITTLE SLICES ALSO SUCH THAT YOU GET THE MICRON THE MICRON IS ONE ONE THOUSANDH OF A CENTIMETER AND IF YOU WANT TO GET A SCENSE OF HOW THICK OR THIN THAT IS THE SIDE OF A CREDICARD THE LITTLE THINSIDE OF A CREDICARD IS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MICRONS THICK SO IF YOU SET YOUR CREDICARD FLAT ON A TABLE AND THAT YOU LOOK AT IT FROM THE SIDE THAT TINY TINY THIN LITTLE EDGE THAT'S ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MICRONS THE COLD VIRUS IS MADE UP OF PARTICLES THAT AR PROBABLY IN THE RANGE OF ABOUT FIVE MICRONS OR SO SO IT'S EXTREMELY SMALL I'M IN THE COLD VIRUS THEREFOR WITH A GOOD SNEEZE OR EVEN A LIGHT SNEEZE CAN SPREAD RELY FAR NOW THE GOOD NEWS IS THOSE PARTICLES ARE RELATIVELY HEAVY THEY DON'T TEND O MIST ABOUT IN THE AIR FOR VERY LONG THEY TEND TO FALL DOWN ON TO THE GROUND OR ON TO SURFACES BUT AS IY MENTION BEFORE IT THEY CAN SURVIVE FOR VERY LONG TIME ON THOSE SURFACES SO SHOULD YOU TOUCH YOUR HAND TO A DOOR HANDLE OR TABLE OR SHAKE THE HAND OF SOMEBODY THAT HAS COLD VIRUS ON THEIR HANDS EITHER BECAUSE THEY THEMSELVES HAVE A COLD OR THEY CONTACT WITH SOMEBODY ELSE HEAD COLD VIRUS IN IT SOMEHOW LANDED ON THEIR HANDS JUST CAUSE THE OTHER PERSON SNEEZE ALL THESE CENARIOS ARE VERY REALISTIC THAT COLD VIRUS WILL NOT IN FACT YOU UNLESS IT CAN GET INSIDE OF YOUR BODY AND ONE OF THE PRIMARY ENTRY POINTS OF IT GETTING INSIDE YOUR BODY IS VIA THE EYES BY WIPING THAT COLD VIRUS ON YOUR EYES NOW YOU MAY THINK O CAY I'M JUST NOC KING TO TOUCH MY EYES BUT A LOPIT LATER WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT A STUDY THAT SHOWS THAT ALMOST ALWAYS INDEED ALMOST ALWAYS WHEN YOU MEET SOMEBODY NEW YOU TOUCH YOUR EYES AND THE FREQUENCY OF PEOPLE TOUCHING THEIR FACE THAT IS THE REGION OF THE FACE AROUND THE EYES AND THEIR EYES THROUGHOUT THE DAY IS EXTREMELY HIGH SO THIS IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY ROUTES BY WHICH THE COLD VIRUS IS TRANSMITTED FROM ONE PERSON TO THE NEXT BUT OF COURSE THERE'S ALSO THEUGRHOUT THAT WERE ALL FAMILIAR WITH WHICH IS THE PERSON THAT IS SNEEZING OR COUGHING ORE BLOWING THEIR NOSE INTO TISSUES AND THEN THROWING THEM IN THE TRASH AND NOT WASHING THEIR HANDS AFTER EACH IN EVERY TIME THEY DO THAT SO AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF TO DAY'S DISCUSSION THAT WE WILL GET INTO ONCE I ALSO PRESENT YOU WHAT A FLUE IS AND HOW IT DIFFERS FROM THE COLD IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO TALK ABOUT WHAT STAGE OF INFECTION PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY CONTAGIOUS WITH THE COLD OR FLUE AND THERE'S ACTUALLY A LOT OF MYTHOLOGY ABOUT THIS IN FACT THERE'S A LOT OF JUST LYING ABOUT THIS PEOPLE WILL BE COUGHING OR SNEEZING AND THEY'LL SAY O YAM NOT CONTAGIOUS ANY LONGER OR PEOPLE MAKE UP THESE THINGS LIKE OH YOU KNOW IF YOU HAD THE FLUE FOR TWO DAYS THAN YOU'RE NO LONGER CONTAGIOUS OR THAT YOU CAN'T BE CONTAGIOUS UNTIL YOU HAVE SYMPTEMS SO WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH ALL THE ASPECTS OF CONTAGION AND HOW COUGHING OR SNEEZING OR HOW LONG YOU'VE HAD A COLD OR FLUE ACTUALLY RELATES TO WHETHER NOT YOU'RE CONTAGIOUS IN A LITTLE BIT BUT FOR THE TIME BEING KNOW THAT THE COLD VIRUSES VERY VERY SMALL IT CAN BE TRANSMITTED THROUGH THE AIR IT CAN BE TRANSMITTED VIAH CONTACT FROM SKINTOSKIN CONTACT AND IT CAN SURVIVE ON SURFACES FOR UP TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND WHEN YOU TOUCH THOSE SURFACES OR A PERSON WITH THE COLD VIRUS MOST OFTEN THE WAY IT'S GOING TO GET INTO YOUR BODY AND INFECT YOU SOTHAT YOU GET A COLD IS BY TOUCHING YOUR IE REGION LTHOUGH TOUCHING OTHER REGIONS OF YOUR BODY CAN ALSO PASS THE COLD VIRUS INTO YOU FOR INCENCE THE MOUTH AND LIPS BUT THAT'S ATUALLY FAR LESS COMMON SO WE'LL GET INTO THAT IN JUST A LITTLE BIT NOW DIFFERENT CERATYPES THAT IS DIFFERENT TYPES OF COLD VIRUS TEND TO CREATE A DIFFERENT ARRAY OF OVER ALL SYMPTEMS SUCH THAT YOU KNOW ONE COLD MIGHT BE A REALLY COTICAL BAD COLD OTHERS ARE MORE MILD SOME TEND TO INDUCE MORE RUNNY NOSE OTHERS MORE STUFFY HEAD AND A LOBIT OF FEVER OR IN SOME CASES A LOT OF FEVER ONE THING THAT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTANDIGS THAT IF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE INFECTED BY THE COLD VIRUS THEY TEND TO DEVELOP SYMPTEMS ONE TO TWO DAYS AFTER THEY WERE EXPOSED TO THE VIRS NOW THE GOOD NEWS IS IF YOU ARE EXPOSED TO THE COLD VIRUS THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT YOU ARE GOING TO CATCH THAT COLD VIRUS THAT IS IF YOU REMUNE SYSTEM CAN FIGHT OFF THAT COLD EVEN IF YOU'VE NEVER BEEN EXPOSED TO THAT CERATYPE BEFOR THEN YOU WON'T ACTUALLY HAVE THAT COLD THAN YOU WON'T TRANSMITTED SO PUT DIFFERENTLY IT IS POSSIBLE TO AVOID GETTING A COLD VIRUS EVEN IF YOU'VE NEVER BEEN EXPOSED TO THAT CERATYPE OF COLD VIRUS AND YOU HAPPEN TO COMM INTO CONTACT WITH SOMEBODY WHO HAS THAT CERATYPE OF COLD VIRUS OR YOU TOUCH A SURFACE OF SOME OBJECT DOOR HANDLE AT SETERA THAT HAS APARTICULAR CERATYPE OF THE COLD VIRUS ON IT AND GOT FORBID YOU THEN WIPE YOUR EYES THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET SICK AND A GOOD PORTION F TO DAY'S EPISODE IS GOING TO FOCUS ON TOOLS THAT ARE SUPPORTED BY SCIENCE THAT ALLOW YOU TO BOLSTER UROMEUN SYSTEM AND GREATLY INCREASE HE PROBABILITY THAT EVEN IF YOU'RE EXPOSED TO A NOVEL SERATYPE OF THE COLD VIRUS THAT IS ONE THAT'S NEW TO YOU THAT YOUR BODIES NEVER SEEN BEFORE THAT YOU WON'T GET SICK ANOTHER THING TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE COLVIRUS IS THA YOU'RE GENERALLY MOST CONTAGIOUS TO OTHER PEOPLE WHEN YOU FEEL AT YOUR WORST THAT IS WHEN YOU'R COUGHING AND SNEEZING AND YET TH STUFFY HEAD WATERY EYES AND SO ON BUT YOU CAN ALSO BE CONTAGIOUS TO OTHER PEOPLE WHEN YOU ARE STARTING TO FEEL BETTER THAT SAID MOST OF THE DATE O POINT TO THE FACT THAT ABOUT FIVE TO SIX DAYS AFTER YOU HIT YOUR PEAK OF WORST SYMPTOMS OR I GESS WE SHOULD SAY YOURE NADEAR THE DIP OF WORSE SYMPTOMS CAUSE IT'S SUCH AN AWFUL STATE TO BE IN YOU ARE PROBABLY EXITING THE PHAYS IN WHICH YOU'RE CONTAGIOUS NOW I WONT TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT IF YOU'VE HAD A COLD FOR FIVE OR SIX DAYS THAT YOU ARE NO LONGER CONTAGIOUS IF YOU CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE SNEEZING AND CUGHING WATERY EYES IN THE EVENING YOU'R FEELING MUCH WORSE FIRSTING IN THE MORNING YOU'RE FEELING ESPECIALLY GROGGY ET CETERA WELL THEN YOU ARE STILL CONTAGIOUS ANOTHER WAY TO FRAMETHESS IS YOU KNOW THOSE PEOPLE THAT CON TINUE TO SHOW UP AT THE GIM AND SHOW UP AT WORK THEY TELL YOU YE I GOT THIS COLD BUT I'VE HAD IT FOR A FEW DAYS I'M NO LONGER CONTAGIOUS IN THEIRE WIPE IN THEIR EYES AND THEIRE BLOWING THEIR NOSE FRANKLY THEY DON'T KNOWHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THEY ARE BASICALLY A WALKING TALKING BREATHING SNEEZING COUGHING COLD VIRUS VECTOR A VECTOR IS A ROUT FOR PASSAGE OF A VIRUS SO PLEASE IF YOU ARE SNEEZING IF YOU ARE COUGHING IF YOU ARE STILL EXPERIENCING THE SYMPTOMS OF A COLD STAY HOME STAY AWAY FROM OTHER PEOPLE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLEAND I REALIZE THAT SOME PEOPLE SIMPLY CANNOT AVOID GOING TO WORK OR CANNOT AVOID INTRACTING WITH OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS OR OTHER PEOPLE THEY HAVE THE COLD VIRUS BUT THIS MYTHOLOGY THAT IF WE'VE HAD A COLD FOR A FEW DAYS AND WE'RE STARTING TO FEEL BETTER BUT WERE STILL EXHIBITING SYMPTOMS THAT WEARE NOT CONTAGIOUS THAT IS PURE MYTHOD'S SIMPLY NOT GROUNDED IN FACT NOW THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT THAT FIRST DAY OR TWO AFTER WHICH WERE EXPOSED TO A COLD VIRUS WHERE WE ARE NOT EXPERIENCING SYMPTOMS AND IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE TO PASS THE COLD VIRUS ON TO OTHER PEOPLE BUT I THINK THAT EVERY WORK PLACE EVERY HOME ENVIRONMENT EVERY GIM EVERY SOCIETY WOULD BENEFIT GREATLY IF PEOPLE WHO WERE SICK WITH THE COLD DID NOT EXPOSE OTHER PEOPLE TO THAT COLDVIRUS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND INDEED THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT A FEW SNIFFLES AND WATERY EYES THERE'S AN ENORMOUS FINANCIAL AND MENTAL HEALTH COST AND PHYSICAL HEALTH COSTS TO PEOPLE GETTING THE COLD AND THIT'S NOT JUST ABOUT PEOPLE WHO REMUNE COMPROMISED OR ELDERLY PEOPLE WHAT WERE GENERALLY REFERRING TO AS THE COLD TO DAY CAN BE MILD IT CAN BE MODERATE IT CAN ALSO BE VERY SEVERE AND IT CAN EXASCERBATE OTHER HEALTH ISSUES THAT PEOPLE HAVE AND WILL TALK ABOUT THAT ELOBIT LATER AND HOW TO OFFSET SOME OF THOSE HEALTHISHES O KAS SO NOW TLET'S TALK ABOUT THE FLUVIRUS THE FLUVIRUS IS AS I MENTIONED A VIRUS AND JUST LIKE WIT THE COLD THERE ARE DIFFERENT CERATYPES OF THE FLUVIRUS THERE'RE ALSO DIFFERENT GENERAL CATEGORIES OF FLU VIRS SO YOU'VE GOT YOUR A TYPE FLUVIRUS IS YOUR BEETYPE FLUVIRUSES AND YOUR SEAT TYPE FLUVIRISES AND BY THE WAY I'M SAYING FLUVIRISES BUT OF COURSE AM REFERRING TO INFLUENZA BUT IT'S JUST COND OF COMMONPLACE NOWADAYS TO REFER TO INFLUENZA AS THE FLUE SIMILAR TO COAL VRISES THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF FLUVIRISES EXIST BASED ON THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROTNES THAT THEY EXPRESS ON THEIR SURFAS IN FACT IN THE NEWS OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THERE BEEN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FLUVIRIS STRAINS THAT HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED ACCORDING TO THEIR SURFACE PROTINE CHARACTERISTICS THINGS LIKE THE H ONE AND ONE VIRIS WHAT IS H ONE AND ONE H ONE AND ONE DESCRIBES THE DIFERENT TYPES OF PROTINES THAT ARE EXPRESSED ON THE SURFACE OF THAT PARTICULAR FLUVIRIS NOW THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF FLUVIRISES ARE IN THAT A CATEGORY OF FLUES THIS IS THE TYPE OF FLUE THAT CAUSE THE SPANISH FLUE NOW THE SPANISH FLUE WHICH BY THE WAY DID NOT ORIGINATE IN SPAIN PEOPLE THINK IT PROBABLY ORIGINATED IN NEW YORK PERHAPS ELSEWHERE BUT CERTAINLY NOT IN SPAIN KILLED ANYWHERE FROM SEVENTEENE TO FIFTY MILLION PEOPLE DEPENDING ON WHICH LITERATURE YOU READ THAT'S AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND IT OCCURRED IN FOUR DIFFERENT WAVES OF INFECTION THAT OCCURRED BETWEEN THE YEARS NINETEEN EIGHTEEN AND NINETEEN TWENTY THE SPANISH FLUE WAS A TYPE A H ONE AND ONE VIRIS AND ACTUALLY IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT THIS WINTER SEASON THERE HAVE BEEN SOME CASES OF H ONE AND ONE ALREADY REPORTED IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE OWOF COURSE THE GOAL IS ALWAYS TO CONTAIN THE PROPAGATION OF THOSE FLUVIRISES AND THAT IS DONE THROUGH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT APPROACHES THE BEST AND MOST RELIABLE APPROACH OF COURS IS TO NOT COME INTO CONTACT WITH SOMEBODY THAT IS CARRYING THE H ONE AND ONE OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF FLUVIRIS HOWEVER BASED ON THE WAY THAT THE FLUVIRIS INFECTS THE VODY THE WAY THAT THE SYMPTOMS EMERGE AND THE WAYS THAT VIRIS IS PROPAGATE THAT CAN'T ALWAYS BE AVOIDED ONE THING TO KNOW AND I CONSIDER THIS OF FORTUNATE ASPECT OF FLUVIRIS BIOLOGY IS THAT THE FLUVIRIS UNLIKE THE COALD VIRIS CAN ONLY EXIST ON SURFACES FOR ABOUT TWOU HOURIS AFTER ABOUT TWO VOURS IT TENDS TO DIE OFF SO THE FLUVIRIS IS MOST TYPICALLY PASSED BY HUMAN HUMAN CONTACT OR COMING INTO CONTACT THAT IS WALKING INTO A CLOUD OF SOMEBODY'S SNEES THAT CONTAINS FLUVIRIS OR SOMEBODY'S COUGH THAT CONTAINS FLUVIRIS AND YES IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SHAKING SOME ONE' TAIN COULD ACTUALLY INTRODUCE FLUVIRIS TO YOUR HAND AND THEN IF YOU WIPE YOUR EYES OR I'LL TALK ABOUT A FEW OTHER PORTALS OF ENTRY FOR THE LUVRIS AND COULDVIRIS IN A FEW MINUTES CAN GET INTO YOUR BODY AND INFECT YOU AND YES YOU CAN PICK UP THE LUVIRIS FROM SURFACES HOWEVER THAT IS FAR LESS COMMON THAN THE FLUVIRIS PASSING FROM HUMAN HUMAN CONTACT NOW THERE ARRANT AS MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF FLUVIRIS AS THERE ARE TYPES OF COLDVIRIS AND THAT'S WHY THERE HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTS AT MAKING FLUVAXINES OR SO CALLED FLU SHOTS I THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE SIGNS AND ADVERTISEMENTS ON LINE AND IN THE WORK PLACE AND SCHOOL SAYING YOU GET YOUR FLU SHOT THIS SEASON THE REASON THAT FLU CHOTS CAN EXIST AT ALL IS BECAUSE THERE ARE LIMITED ENOUGH TYPES OF FLUVIRIS PRESENT IN A GIVEN YEAR THAT SPECIFIC TVAXINES THAT IS FLUE SHOTS CAN BE GENERATED AGAINST THAT PARTICULAR STRAIN OF THE FLUE VIRUS SO HOW EFFECTIVE IS THE FLUE SHOT AND I WANT TO BE VERY SPECIFIC HERE WHEN WE SAY THE FLUE SHOT SINGULAR IT SORT OF IMPLIES THAT THERE'S ONE FLUE SHOT THAT CAN COMBAT ALL THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF FLUE AND AS YOU JUST LEARN THAT IS NOT THE CASE SO WE PROBABLY SHOULD BE SAYING THE FLUE SHOTS BUT JUST FOR SAKE OF SIMPLICITY WHEN I SAY THE FLUE SHOT I MEAN THE FLUE SHOT THAT'S GIVEN INAGIVEN FLUE SEASON THAT IS DIRECTED AT SPECIFIC STRAINS OF THE FLUE BECAUSE RESEARCHERS THAVE DETERMINED THAT THAT PARTICULAR STRAIN OF FLUE OR STRAINS OF FLUE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE MOST ABUNDANT FOR THAT PARTICULAR FLUE SEASON STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT GETTING THE FLUE SHOT REDUCES ONE'S RISK OF CONTRACTING THE PARTICULAR FLUE THAT IS MOST ABUNDANT THAT SEASON BY ABOUT FORTY TO SIXTY PER CENT BUT OF COURSE THE FLUE SHOT IS COMPLETELY INEFFECTIVE AT COMBATING ANY OTHER FORMS OF THE FLUE VIRUS AND OF COURSE COLDS OR OTHER TYPES OF UPPER RESPIATORY INFECTIONS STUDIES HOFE ALSO SHOWN THAT TAKING THE FLUE SHOT CAN REDUCE THE SEVERITY OF ONE SYMPTOMS IF THEY IN FACT GET THE FLUE ANYWAY NOW PERSONALLY I DON'T TYPICALLY GET THE FLUE SHOT AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT I DON'T TEND TO GO INTO ENVIRONMENTS WHERE I AM PARTICULARLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO GETTING THE FLUE I DON'T WORK IN A HOSPITAL OR CLINNIC I DON'T TEND TO INTERACT WITH LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE ON A DAILY BASIS SO FOR ME I'VE OPTED NOT TO GET THE FLUE SHOT NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT I'VE NEVER CONTRACTED THE FLUE AS I MENTIONED EARLIER I TEND TO GET SICK WITH A COLD OR FLUE ABOUT ONCE EVERY EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR MONTHS AND THE SEVERITY OF THAT COLD OR FLUE HAS RANGE FROM INNOW AT ONE POINT A VERY HIGH FEVER IN ONE CASE BUARTYPICALLY A MODERATE FEVER AND THE USUAL SYMPTOMS OF MALAYS THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING AND I'VE MANAGE TO GET OVER THOSE WITHOUT HAVING TAKEN THE FLUE HOT PRETTY EASILY NOW OF COURSE WE ALSO DON'T KNOW THAT THOSE WERE ACTUALLY FLUES DESPITE THE DISTINCT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SYMPTOMS OF COLD AND FLUE MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHETHER NOT THEY HAVE A COLD OR FLUE SO THIS IS ANOTHER THING TO THINK ABOUT WHEN CONSIDERING WHETHER NOT TO GET THE FLUE SHOT ULTIMATELY BECAUSE AT LEAST TO MY KNOWLEDGE MOST WORKPLACES DO NOT MANDATE THAT PEOPLE GET THE FLUE SHOT I COULD BE WRONG ABOUT CERTAIN WORKPLACES BUT MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT MOST WORKPLACES DO NOT MANDATE THAT PEOPLE GET THE FLUE SHOT WHEN YOU TAKE THE FLUESHOT YOU'RE REALLY HEDGING A BET YOURE HEDGING A BED AGAINST THE FACT THAT YOU WILL BE OR NOT BE EXPOSE TO THAT PARTICULAR STRAIN OF FLUE VIRIS THAT'S MOST ABUNDANT THAT SEASON OR STRAINS OF FLUVIRIS THAT ARE MOST ABUNDANT THAT SEASON AND THAT THE FLUE SHOT THAT YOU'RE TAKING IS DIRECTED AT THOSE PARTICULAR STRAINS SO AGAIN IN MY CASE I DON'T TEND TO TAKE THE FLUE SHOT BUT OF COURSE YOU NEED TO MAKE THE DECISION THAT'S RIHT FOR YOU FOR INSTANCE IF YOU HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS THAT ARE IMMUNE COMPROMISED OR YOU WORK IN A SCOOL OR YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE EXPOSED TO A LOT OF FLUES OR YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT TRANSMITTING FLUE TO ANY ONE INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION AND OF COURSE SPEAK TO YOUR PHYSICION I WILL ALSO SAY THIS WHICH IS THAT I MENTION THAT I'VE TENDED TO CATCH COLD S OR FLUES AT A RATE OF ABOUT ONCE EVERY EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR MONTHS AND WHEN I SAY A COLD OR FLUE I MEAN A SERIOUS ONE ONE THAT KEEPS ME IN BED WHERE I HAVE A FEVER AND I'M SWEATING WHAT I HAVE DONE AND I CONTINUE TO DO IS BECAUSE I PAY PRETTY CLOSE ATTENTION TO HOW WELL I'M SLEEPING OR DIFFERENT LIFE EVENTS MI DIFFERENT WORK OUTS ET CETERA ND I PUT THOSE INTO MY CALENDER AND I HAVE A SHORT HAND TO DO THAT SO IT ONLY TAKES ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS EACH DAY OCADE DID THIS WORK OUT IT WAS KIND OF LEVEL SEVEN OUT OF TEN INTENSITY GOT GOOD SLEEP LAST NIGHT OR POOR SLEEP AND I KNOW WHAT GOOD AND POOR SLEEP IS FOR ME AND THAT'S ABOUT THE LEVEL THAT I'M CHARTING THESE THINGS I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE EVENTS PRECEDING WHEN I'VE COME DOWN WITH A COLD OR FLUE AGAIN I DON'T KNOW WHETHER I WAS A COLD OR FLUE BUT BEFORE I GOT SICK AND IAVE SEEN FOR INSTANCE I'VE EVER DONE TWO HARD WORK OUTS IN A DAY SOMETHING I NEVER DO ANY LONGER I'VE TENDED TO GET SICK AFTER THAT IF I'VE TENDED TO DO HARD WORK OUTS AND THEN EXPOSE MYSELF TO COLD TEMPERATURES WHILE TRAVELING ESPECIALY TRAVELING OVER SEES THAT TENDED TO PRECEDE THOSE COLDS OR FLUES WHICH AGAIN FOR ME AR VERY SELDOM SO IT'S A LIMITED DAY TO SET THIS IS ENTIRELY ANEC DATE I MEANING RELATED TO MY OWN HISTORY OF GETTING COLDS OR FLUES BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT I ACTUALLY RECOMMEND PEOPLE DO WHICH IS YOU KNON'T TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHEN YOU FIRST START TO GETTING SYMPTEMS PAY ATTENTION WHEN YOU GOT OVER A GIVEN WHAT YOU THINK IS A COLD OR FLUE AND THEN TO LOOK AT WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE DAYS BEFORE IN THAT DAY I DON'THNG IT'S POSSIBLE TO DO HYPER PRECISE FORENSICS ON A COLD OR FLUE RIGHT I'MAN YOU COULD HAVE GONE INTO THE GA STATION PUT YOUR CREDIT CARD IN THE MACHINE TO YOUN GRAB A DRINK OUT OF THE REFRIDGER AND PICKED UP A COLD OR FLUE FROM THE HANDLE OF THE REFRIGERATOR OR FROM THE CREDIT CARD MACHINE OR EVEN FROM THE GASPUMP YOU SIMPLY DON'T KNOW HOWEVER IF YOU LOOK AT THE PATTERN OF BEHAVIOUR TRAVEL SLEEP EXERCISE SORTS OF INTERACTIONS YOU ARE HAVING PRIOR TO GETTING A BAD COLD OR FLUE CHANCES ARE YOU CAN A LEARN SOMETHING INTERESTING AND BE ABLE TO AVOID GETTING A SERIOUS COLD OR FLUE AT LEAST TO SOME EXTENT GOING FORWARD AND I'VE DONE THAT I THINK FAIRLY SUCCESSFULLY BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE FREQUENCE YOUR COLDS OR FLUES THAT I'VE COME DOWN WITH HAS INDEED BEEN DROPPING FROM YEAR TO YEAR SO WHERE AS A DECATE TO GO I TENDED TO GET COLDS OR FLUES PROBABLY ABOUT ONCE A YEAR AND IN SOME CASES EVEN TWICE A YEAR THOUGH THAT WAS PRETTY RARE THAT REALLY EXPANDED TO ABOUT ONCE EVERY EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND THEN IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS I THINK I'VE GOTTEN SICK A TWO TIMES PRETTY BADLY WITH A COLD OR FLUE AND THEN ONCE WITH A KIND OF MILD COLD OR FLUE SO I TELL YOU ALL THAT JUST AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW YOU CAN START TO THINK ABOUT HOW YOUR RIMUNE SYSTEM INTERACTS WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF BEHAVIOURS DIFFERENT TYPES OF SITUATIONS SUCH THAT YOU CAN LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR RIMUNE SYSTEM AND WHAT'S GOING TO BEST PROTECT YOU AGAINST CETTING COLDS AND FLUES GOING FORWARD WHICH OF COURSE IS A GREAT THING TO DO BECAUSE WE ALL THINK THAT WE CAN GET OUT THERE BE AROUND PEOPLE THET ARE COUGHING AND SNEEZING WE CAN GO TO THE GIM WHEN IT'S CROWDED AND WINTER OF THAT PERSON OVER THEIRS YOU KNOW COUGHING BUT IMANA JUSTEEN A STAY A FEW FEET AWAY NO BIG DEAL AND WHILE I DON'T WANT TO TURN ANYONE INTO HYPROCONDRIACTS THAT'S HOW YOU GET INFECTED THAT'S HOW YOU GET AR COLD OR FLUE ND AT THE SAME TIME I DON'T THINK ANY ONE SHOULD YOU KNOW GET TO THE POINT WHERE HEY'RE AFRAID TO GO INTO A JAM OR AFRAID TO GO TO THE WORK PLACE BUT I WILL SAY ONCE AGAIN IF YOU'RE SICK WITH A COLDER FLUE IF YOU ARE COUGHING SNEEZING BLOWING YOUR NOSE RUNNI EYES AND YOURE WALKING INTO WORK WERE THE GIM OR ON TO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AN YOU'RE TELLING PEOPLE I'M NOT CONTAGIOUS YOU'R LYING I LIKE TO TAKE A BRIEF MOMENT AND THINK ONE OF OUR SPONSORS AND THAT'S A G ONE A G ONE IS A VITEMIN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT ALSO CONTAINS ADAPTIGENCS I STARTED TAKING A G ONE AWAY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE THE REASON I STARTED TAKING IT N THE REASON I STILL TAKE IT EVERY DAY IS THAT IT INSURES THAT I MEET ALL OF MY QUOTAS FOR VITEMENS AND MINERALS AND IT INSURES THAT I GET ENOUGH PREBIOTIC AND PROBIOTIC TO SUPPORT GOT HEALTH NOW GOD HEALTH IS SOMETHING THAT OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS WE REALIZE IS NOT JUST IMPORTANT FOR THE HEALTH OF OUR GOT BUT ALSO FOR OUR MUN SYSTEM AND FOR THE PRODUCTION OF NAURO TRANSMITTERS AND UROMODULATORS THINGS LIKE DOPAMINE AND CERATONEN IN OTHER WORDS GOD HEALTH IS CRITICAL FOR PROPER BRAIN FUNCTIONING NOW OF COURSE I STRIVE TO CONSUME HEALTHY WHOLE FOODS FOR THE MAJORITY OF MY NUTRITIONAL INTAKE EVERY SINGLE DAY BUT THERE ARE NUMBER OF THINGS IN A G ONE INCLUDING SPECIFIC MICRO NUTRIANS THAT ARE HARD TO GET FROM WHOLE FOODS ARE AT LEAST IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES SO A G ONE ALLOWS ME TO GET THE VITEMENS AND MINERALS THAT I NEED PROBIOTICS PREBOTICS THE ADAPTAGENS AND CRITICAL MICRONUTRIENS SO ANY TIME SOMEBODY ASKS ME IF THEY WERE TO TAKE JUST ONE SUPPLEMENT WHAT THAT SUPPLEMENT SHOULD BE I TELL THEM A G ONE BECAUSE A G ONE SUPPORT SO MANY DIFFERENT SYSTEMS WITHIN THE BODY THAT ARE INVOLVED IN MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE TO TRY A G ONE GO TO DRINK A G ONE DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMEN AND YOU'LL GET A YOUR SUPPLY O VITEMEN D THRE K TWO AND FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS OF A G ONE AGAIN THAT TO DRINK A G ONE DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMEN NOW THE DIABOLICAL THING ABOUT THE FLUE VIRUS IS THAT JUST LIKE THE DIABOLICAL THING ABOUT THE COL VIRUS YOU START SHEDDING VIRUS THAT IS YOU ARE CONTAGIOUS ABOUT TWENTY FOUR HOURS PRIOR TO THE ONSET OF FIRST SYMPTOMS FOR YOU SO THAT MEANS THAT YOU CAN BE A FLUE VIRAL VECTOR EVEN WHEN YOU AREN'T HAVING SYMPTOMS THAT'S JUST THE UNFORTUNATE ASPECT OF THESE VIRUSES THE'RE VERY CLEVER THEY DON'T HAVE BRAINS BUT THESE VIRUSES HAVE ADAPTED TO PROPAGATE FROM HOST TO HOST TO HOST THEY HAVE A DRIVE TO CONTINUE TO STAY ALIVE AND TO INFECT MORE HOST SO EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T HAVE A BRAIN THEY HAVE A SORT OF A LET'S CALL IT VIRAL INTELLIGENCE AND AS I'VE SAID SEVERAL TIMES NOW IF YOU ARE STILL EXHIBITING SYMPTEMS OF THE COLDER FLUE YOU ARE CONTAGIOUS HOWEVER WITH RESPECT TO THE FLUE YOU ARE MOST CONTAGIOUS JURING THE THREE DAYS WHEN YOU FEEL THE ABSOLUTE WORST WHEN YOUR FEVER IS AT ITS WORST WELL TALK ABOHOW TO DEAL WITH FEVER ELOBIT LATER WHEN YOU ARE COUGHING AND SNEEZING HEADACHE ALL THAT WHEN THAT IS AT ITS PEAK THAT IS WHEN YOU ARE MOST CONTAGIOUS SO AGAIN I REALIZE THAT PEOPLE CAN'T ALWAYS AVOID CONTACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND LIVE UNDER THE SAME ROOF CARETAKER IS INTERACTING WITH THE PERSON THAT HAS THE COLDER FLUE AND I DO WONT TO REMIND YOU SOMETHING I SAID EARLIER WHICH IS JUST BECAUSE YOU COME INTO CONTACT WITH A COLDER FLUE DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT YOU WILL COME DOWN WITH THAT IS BE INFECTED BY A COLDER FLUE WHETHER OR NOT YOU COME DOWN WITH A COLDER FLUE IS OF COURSE DEPENDENT ON WHETHEROR NOT YOU COME INTO CONTACT WITH H YOU CAN'T CATCH A COLDER FLUE THAT YOU'VE NEVER COME INTO CONTACT WITH JUST LIKE YOU CAN'T GET EAEN BY A SHARK IF YOU NEVER GO IN THE OCEAN HOWEVER THE PROBABILITY OF COMING DOWN WITH THAT COLDER FLUE OF IT GETTING PAST YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM BARRIERS AND INFECTING YOU IS GOING TO BE STRONGLY DICTATED BY THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM FOR WHICH THERE ARE THREE MAJOR ASPECTS WHICH WILL TALK ABOUT NEXT AND OF COURSE THE THINGS THAT YOU DO TO BOLSTER THOSE THREE ASPECTS OF YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM OCA LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM I HAVE TO CONFESS THAT EVEN THOUGH I SPENT WELL OVER THREE DECADES BEING A STUDENT OF AND A RESEARCHER OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THE IMMUNE SYSTEM IS O SO COOL AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE IT HAS ITS INCREDIBLE ELEGANCE AND LOGIC TO IT IT BASICALLY CONSYST OF THREE MAJOR LINES OF DEFENSE THERE'S A PHYSICAL BARRIER OR RATHER A SET OF PHYSICAL BARRIERS THAT EXIST BETWEEN THE ORGANS OF YOUR BODY AND THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND YOU'RE POBABLY IMMEDIATELY THINKING SKIN AND YES IT INDEED IT INCLUDES YOUR SKIN BUT ALSO SOME INTERESTING THINGS LIKE THE MUCOSAL LINING OF YOUR NOSE AND MOUTH AND EVEN SOME OF THE LIQUIDS THAT ARE ON THE SURFACE OF YOUR EYES WILL TALK ABOUT THOSE IN A MOMENT THEN THERE'S A SECOND LINE OF DEFENSE WHICH IS FOR ANY VIRUS OR BACTERIA OR FUNG IS FOR THAT MATTER BUT TO DAY WERE TALK ABOUT VIRUSES COLDS AND FLUE VIRUSES ANY VIRUS IS THAT GET PASS THE PHYSICAL BARRIER OF YOUR SKIN AND THE MUCOSAL LINING OF PARTICULAR REGIONS OF YOUR BODY WELL THEN YOU HAVE WHAT'S CALLED THE INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM THE INNATE MUNE SYSTEM IS THIS VERY GENERALIZED RESPONSE SYSTEM IT'S GENERAL IN THE SENSE THAT IT DEPLOYS A BASIC SET OF NEROCHEMICALS THAT ARE NOT SPECSIFIC TO THE PARTICULAR VIRUS THAT'S MADE IT INTO YOUR BODY SO NOT ONLY IS IT NOT SPESCIFIC TO A PARTICULAR SERATYPE OF THE COLD OR A DIFFERENT TYPE OF FLUVIRUS BUT IT'S NOT EVEN DISCRIMINATING BETWEEN COLD OR FLUVIRIS THIS THING WE CALL THE INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM IS TA GENERALIZED RESPONSE SYSTEM TO GO AND COMBAT VIRUSES SO IT COULD BE A COLD TIT COULD BE A FLUE IT COULD BE A BACTERIA IT COULD BE A FUNGUS HIT COULD EVEN BE A PHYSICAL OBJEC AND YOUR INNATE MUNE SYSTEM RESPONSE BY SAYING OKE LET'S GO DEAL WITH THIS NOW THE THIRD COMPONET OF EUROMUNE SYSTEM IFS WHAT'S CALLED THE ADAPTIVE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND I ALLUDED TO THIS ASPECT OF EUROMUNE SYSTEM A LITOBAT EARLIER THE ADAPTOFE MUNE SYSTEM IS THE ASPECT OF OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM THAT RECOGNIZES BECAUSE THE INNATEMUNE SYSTEM TOLD IT THAT SOMETHING HAS INFECTED THE BODY AT SOME LEVEL THAT SOME ORGAN OR SET OF ORGANS AND THEIR'S AN EMERGEN CY AND THE ADAPTOF IMMUNE SYSTEM GOES IN AND IN A VERY TARGETED WAY FIGURES OUT WHAT SORTS OF PROTANES IT NEEDS TO PRODUCE THAT IS ANTOBODIES TO COMBAT THAT SPECIFIC SEROTYPE OF VIRUS O CASE OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM HAS A PHYSICAL BARRIER COMPONENT AND IT'S NOT YOUR SKIN SOME OTHER THINGS AS WELL YOUVE GOT YOUR INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM WHICH IS THIS GENER ALIZED RESPONSE SYSTEM AND THEN THERE'S THE ADAPT OF IMMUN SYSTEM LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PHYSICAL BARRIER COMPONENT FIRST AND THIS IS ACTUALLY GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO JUST TAKE A BRIEF STEP BACK AND REALIZE THAT ANY TIME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR PHYSIOLOGY THERE'S GOING TO BE A MECHANICAL SET OF FEATURES AND THERE'S GOING TO BE A CHEMICAL SET OF FEATURES SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE MUNE SYSTEM AND THE ME CHAMICAL FEATURE OR THE PHYSICAL FEATURE OF THE IMION SYSTEM IS THIS BARRIER BETWEEN THE ORGANS OF OUR BODY AND THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND THE MOST OBVIOUS OF THOSE IS THE SKIN YOU ARE CONTAINED IN THIS BAG OF STUFF THAT WE CALL SKIN THE SKIN ISN'T JUST FOR PUTTING CLOTHING ON AND FOR ADORNING WITH JEWELRY OR TATOOS IF THAT'S YOUR THING WATCHES ET CETERA YOUR SKIN IS A LIVING ORGAN IN AN OF ITSELF I THINK WE'RE MOST ACCUSTOM TO THING ABOUT THE HEART AN THE LUNGS AND THE LIVER IN THE BRAIN AS ORGANS OF THE BODY BUT THE SKIN IS AN ORGAN OF THE BODY IS WELL AS A BUNCH OF IFFERENT LAYERS OF CELLS FROM THE OUTSIDE TO THE INSIDE ACTUALLY THE SKIN CELLS THEMSELVES ARE MADE IN THE DEEPER LAYERS OF THE SKIN AND THE MIGRATE OUT TOWARDS THE SURFACE OF THE SKIN AND AT THE SURFACE OF THE SKIN ON TOP OF THOSE CELLS AND MADE BY THOSE CELLS ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CHEMICALS THAT ACTUALLY SERVE AS ANTIBACTERIAL AND ANTIVIRAL AGENTS MEANING IF A COLD VIRUS OR FLUVIRUS OR OTHER TYPE OF IRS LANDS ON THE SKIN IT CAN NEUTRALIZE AN KILL THAT VIRUS SO YOUR SKIN IS A VERY IMPORTANT PHYSICAL BARRIER AGAINST VIRUSES SUCH AS THE COLDER FLUVIRIS GETTING INTO YOUR BODY AND INFECTING OTHER CELLS AND TISSUES NOW YOUR SKIN IS NOT CONTIGUOUS MEANING THERE ARE HOLES IN IT SO LET'S THINK ABOUT THOSE HOLES FOR A SECOND  WE GO FROM HEAD TO FOOT IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT YOUR EYES HAVE THESE TWO OPENINGS AND THOSE ARE OPENINGS IN YOUR SKIN RIGHT AS YOU OPEN YOUR EYELIDS BENEATH THERE ARE YOURE CORNIAS THE SHINING PART OF YOUR EYES AND A LITTLE IT FURTHER BACK AT THE BACK IN ER LINING OF YOUR EYEBALL YOU HAVE A VERY THIN THREE CELL LAYERS THAT PIECE OF TISSUE THAT WE CALL THE NURL RETNA AND I SAY THIS BECAUSE THE NURAL RETNA IS ACTUALLY A PIECE OF YOUR BRAINS YOU HAVE TWO PIECES OF BRAIN THAT LINE THE BACK OF YOUR EYES AND THAT'S THE LIGHT SENSING TISSUE IN THE BACK OF YOUR EYES NOW I SAY THIS BECAUSE WHAT THES MEANS IS THAT IT'S A VERY SHORT DISTANCE BETWEEN THE OPENING OF YOUR SKIN THAT WE CALL YOUR EYELIDS AND YOUR BRAIN NOW MOST OF THE BRAIN OF COURSE IS CONTAINED IN THE CRANIAL VOULT WITHIN WHAT MOST PEOPLE CALL THE SKULL BUT YOUR BRAIN ISN'T FAR AWAY FROM THOSE OPENINGS THAT WE CALL YOUR EYELIDS SO AS A CONSEQUENCE ON THE SURFACE OF YOUR EYES THOSE CORNIAS THE SHINING PART OF YOUR EYES ON THE OUTSIDE THEY'RE A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT CHEMICAL FEATURES THERE ARE TEARS THAT ARE MADE BY YOUR LACKRMOM GLANS BUT THERE ALSO A LOT OF ANTI BACTERIAL AGENT THAT ACTIVELY KILL OFF STUFF THAT COULD POTENTIALLY INFECT YOUR BODY COULD MAKE IT INTO YOUR BODY MABE EVEN INTO YOUR BRAIN IF YOU'VE EVER AWOKEN UP IN THE MORNING AND YOU HAVE SOME CRUST ON YOUR EYES AND YOU AN THINK OF THAT CRUSS THAT CUNTING YELLOWY STUFF SOMETOME ITS YELLOW I NOTHISA KIND OF GROSS THAT'S LUCTALLY DEAD BACTERIA THAT YOUR EYES HAVE SUCCESSFULLY DEFEATED DURING YOUR NIGHT SLEEP SO WHEN YOU WIPE THOSE AWAY YOU'RE TAKING THE CASUALTIES OF A WAR THAT YOU ONE DURING YOUR NIGHT SLEEP AND YOU'RE WHISKING THOSE AWAY NOW AS WE DESCEND A LITLE BIT FURTHER DOWN THE FACE THERE OF COURSE THE NOSTRAL OPENINGS AND THE NOSTRAL OPENINGS TEN TO BE KIND OF STICKY RIGT THEIR MOISTICKY AND WARM IYOU NOT TO PUT YOUR FINGERS UP THEM RIGHT NOW YOU JUST KNOW THEIR MOISTICKY AND WARM ITCH FINGERS AUT YOUR NOSE PLEASE THE MUCOSAL LINING OF YOUR NOSE IS ACTUALLY OF VERY IMPORTANT SUBSTANCE THAT IS STICKY IN ORDER TO TRAP VIRUSES SUCH AS COLDS AND FLUE VIRUSES AND THEN CHEMICAL COMPONENTS WITHIN THE MUCOSA LINING CAN NEUTRALIZE THEM THAT'S THE BEST CASE CONARIO THERE ARE OF COURSE CYNARIOS IN WHICH THE COLD OR FLUVIRUS TAKES RESIDENCE IN YOUR MUCOSA LINING AND CAN MAKE ITS WAY BACK INTO YOUR SINIS PASSAGES AN CAN THEN IN FACT OTHER CELLS AND TISSUES OF YOUR BODY BECAUSE THE VIRUS REPLICATES AND SPREADS THROUGHOUT THE BODY AND THEN GOING AFFOR LITTLE BIT FURTHER DOWN I REALIZE THIS IS OBVIOUS YOU HAVE YOUR MOUTH AND WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING IS THAT YOUR MOUTH ALSO AS MUCOSA LINING WHICH IS STICKY AND HAS CHEMICAL COMPONENTS TO NEUTRALIZE IN COMING VIRUSES BUT WE KNOW THAT THE TYPE OF MUCUS AND THE TYPE OF BACTERIA THAT LIVE IN YOUR NOSE AND MOUTH THAT BY THE WAY ARE VERY HEALTHY FOR YOU AND INCOURAGE HEALTHY UMION SYSTEM FUNCTION THAT IS ACT AS WAYS TO NEUTRALIZE VIRUSIS WITHIN YOUR NOSE AND MOUTH ARE VERY DIFFERENT SO YOUR NOSE IN YOUR MOUTH THEY SEEM SIMILAR AT THE LEVEL OF OCEWHILE IT'S WARM AND STICKY IN THERE THERE'S MUCIS BUT THEY ARE VERY VERY DIFFERENT TISSUES IN FACT IF YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR MOUTH ITS THIS INCREDIBLE STRUCTURE THAT NOT ONLY LETS YOU EAT AND BREATHEIN AND OUT THROUGH ALTHOUGH I SUGGEST MOST PEOPLE BE NASAL BREATHERS FOR MOST OF THE TIME OF THEIR DAY AND NIGHT IF YOU CAN OF COURE SOMETIMES YOU AVE TER MOUTH BREATH BUT KEEP THIS IN MINE THE OTHERS BIG OPENING IN THE FRONT OYOR FACE AND BACTERIOR GETTING IN THER ALL DAY LONG VIRUSES ARE GETTING IN THEIR ALL DAY LONG AND IN MOST CASES YOU ARE SUCCESSFULLY COMBATING THOSE VIRUSES AND BACTERIA BECAUSE THE MUCOSAL LINING OF YOUR MOUTH AND YOUR NOSE FOR THAT MATTER AND THE MICROBIODA THOSE LITTLE MICRO ORGANISMS THATHAVE TAKEN RESIDENCE IN YOUR NOSE AND MOUTH ARE HELPING TO CONTRIBUTE TO FIGHT OFF BACTERIAN VIRUSES PROVIDED THE MICROBIOTA THERE ARE DIVERSE AND ARE OF THE TYPE YOU WANT WHICH WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT LATER AND THEN DESCENDING FURTHER DOWN THE BODY OF COURSE THEIR OTHER OPENINGS IN TO YOUR SKIN BARRIER NAMELY THE YOUR RETHRA OF THE PENUS OR VEGINA AND OF COURSE THE VAGEONAL CANALTH SO THE GENITALS OF COURSE HAVE THEIR OWN MUCOSA LINING AND AS YOU CAN IMAGIN IT IS DISTINCT IN TERMS OF ITS PHYSICAL MAKE UP AND ITS CHEMICAL MAKE UP FROM THE MUCOSA LINING OF YOUR NASAL PASSAGES AND MOUTH AND THN OF COURSE WE HAVE THE RECTUM AND ANUS WHICH IS THE OUTFLO PATHWAY OF YOUR INTESTINS WHICH ARE POST DIGESTIVE AND THERE TOO YOU HAVE A MUCOSAL LINING FOR WHICH YES CERTAIN TYPES OF VIRUSES AND BACTERIA CAN INFECT THAT ARIA BUT WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT THE PRIMARY ENTRYCITES THE MOST COMMON WAYS IN WHICH COLDS AND FLUES GET INTO YOUR BODY THE WAY THEY BREACH THAT PHYSICAL BARRIER THAT WE CALL YOUR SKIN IS THROUGH YOUR EYES YOUR NOSE OR YOUR MOUTH AND THERE ARE A LOT OF DATA SOME OF WHICH CONFLICT AND FRANKLY THERE NEED TO BE MORE DATA IN ORDER TO REALLY RESOLVE THIS BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THE PRIMARY ENTRY SIGHT FOR VIRASES TO GET INTO THE BODY TENDS TO BE THE EYES WERE THE MOUTH AND WE CAN GET INTO SOME OF THE REASONS WHY THAT WOULD BE SO BUT IF YOU THINK BACK TO OUR CONVERSATION ABOUT THE WAY THAT COLDS IN FLUES EXIST IN THE WORLD EITHER AS AEIROSAULS OR ON SURFACES OF OBJECTS OR ON SURFACES OF SKIN WELL THEN WHAT I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU NEXT WILL MAKE IT O SO OBVIOUS WHY THE EYES AND THE MOUTH ARE THE PRIMARY SIDES OF ENTRY FOR COLDS AND FLUES AND IF YOU KEEP THAT IN MIND THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE YOU CAN AVOID A LOT OF COLDS OR FLUES THAT YOU WOULD OTHERWISE CATCH O CASE SO BEFORE I TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANT ROLES OF THE INATE AND THE ADAPT OF IMMUNE SYSTEM IN KEEPING COLDS IN FLUES AT BAY I'LL TELL YOU THAT YOU HAVE A PROBLEM AND THAT PROBLEM IS THAT YOU TEND TO TOUCH YOUR EYES VERY OFTEN IN FACT YOU TEND TO TOUCH YOUR EYES MOST OFTEN AFTER YOU SHOOK SOMEBODY ELSE'S HAND NOW WHY AM I PICKING ON YOU WHELE IN FACT I'M NOT I'M PICKING ON ALL OF YOU AND A PICKING ON MYSELF INCLUDED BECAUSE THEREHAVE BEE SEVERAL STUDIES NOW PRIMARILY FROM NOOM SOBLES SLAB AT THE WHITESMEN INSTITUTE SHOWING THAT WHEN PEOPLE INCOUNTER ANOTHER PERSON AND THEY SHAKE THEIR HAND THEY EITHER TOUCH THEIR EYES OR TOUCH ANOTHER REGION OF THEIR FACE VERY CLOSE TO THE EYES OR THAT THEY TOUCH THEIR HAND TO THEIR MOUTH NOW THERE ARE BUNCH OF THEORIES AS TO WHY PEOPLE DO THIS THERE'S THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY SNIFFING THEIR OWN HAND AND IN PARTICULAR SNIFFING THEIR OWN HAND MORE OFTEN AFTER THEY SHAKE SOME ONE ELSE'S HAND AS A WAY TO DETECT WHAT KEMO SIGNALS EXIST ON THE OTHER PERSON NOT NECESSARILY CONSCIOUS SMELLING OF THE OTHER PERSONS SMELL BUT RATHER SOME SORT OF UNCONSCIOUS MECHANISM BY WHICH WE TAKE THE CHEMICALS OF THE PERSON WE COME INTO CONTACT WITH AND WE BRING THEM TO OUR NOSE OUR EYES OR IN SOME CASES AR UPPER LIP AND THAT OUR OFACTORY SYSTEM THAT IS THE NURONS THAT EXIST JUST BEHIND THE BACK OF OUR NOSE ORE PROCESSING THAT INFORMATION AND GETTING ALL SORTS OF IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT HOW STREST THE OTHER PERSON IS THEIR HORMONES AH WHETHER NOT WE RECOGNIZE THEM THE FACT THAT THEY ARE DIFFERENT FROM US THAT'S RIGHT WE ARE ALSO SMELLING OURSELVES ALL DAY LONG NOEMS LAB HAS SHOWN THIS THAT PEOPLE ARE AND WALKING ROUND IN THEIR OWN ODOR CLOUD WE TEND TO TOUCH OUR ARM PITS WE TEND TO TOUCH DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF OUR BODY YES AND SMELL OURSELVES MULTIBLE TIMES THROUGHOUT THE DAY THIS IS ALL BEING DONE UNCONSCIOUSLY I SUPPOSE SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING IT CONSCIOUSLY AND THAT THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT OUR PHYSIOLOGY AND HEALTH AND WHEN WE DO THIS AFTER SHAKING SOMEBODY'S HAND THAT THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE OTHER PERSONS PHYSIOLOGY IN HEALTH THAT OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM AROW FACTORY SYSTEM IN DEEP PARTS OF OUR BRAIN THAT INVOLVED IN PRIMITIVE TIGHT BEHAVIORS BUT ALSO SOME PRETTY SOPHISTIC GATED BEHAVIORS ARE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT NOW NOUM SOBLE WAS A GUEST ON THE HUBRUMEN LAB POTCAST I ENCOURAGE YOU TO CHECK OUT THAT EPISODE IF YOU HAVE TIME IT'S A FASCINATING VOYAGE INTO THE OFACTORY SYSTEM AND NOCIOUS CONSCIOUS SMELLING OR SNIFFING OF THINGS SO WE GO OH THAT SMELLS GOOD OR THAT SMELLS BAD T OR THAT PERSON YOU KNOWS SOMEBODY I WANT A MATE WITH OR HANG OUT WITH OR AVOID IT'S ALSO UNCONSCIOUS PROCESSING OF SO CALL KEMO SIGNALS CHEMICAL SIGNALS BUT THE REASON I BRING UP THESE STUDIES NOW IN THE CONTECTS OF COLDS AND FLUES AND HOW TO AVOID GETTING COLDS AND FLUES IS AS A REMINDER THAT WE ARE PRETTY MUCH WIRED TO CONTACT OUR OWN FACE WITH OUR OWN HANDS AT THE LEVEL OF OUR EYES NOSE AND UPPER LIP AND AROUND THE EYES VERY SHORTLY AFTER WE TOUCH SOMEBODY ELSE'S SKIN AND IF YOU ARE MINDFUL OF IT YOU CAN ACTUALLY AVOID BRINGING COLDS OR FLUES TO YOUR FACE NOW IN DOING SO ARE YOU'RE GOING TO SHORT CIRCUIT A BUNCH OF OTHER INPORTANT BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES INVOLVED IN UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT BRINGING IN THOSE SMELLS BI SUPPOSE THAT'S POSSIBLE BUT WITH RESPECT TO AVOIDING COLDS AND FLUES IT SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY GOOD TRADE OFF TO ME SO THE POINT THI'M TRY TO MAKE HERE IS THAT IN ORDER FOR YOU TO CATCH OUR COLDS OR FLUE THAT COLD OR FLUVIRIS THE LITTLE PARTICLES OF COLD AND FLUVIRIS NEED TO MAKE IT INTO YOUR BODY AND THE PRIMARY ENTRYSIDES ARE EYES NOSE MOUTH AND THE PRIMARY ACTIONS BY WHICH WE BRING COLDS AND FLUVIRIS'S TO OUR EYES NOSE MOUTH ARE BY TOUCHING OTHER PEOPLE OR BY TOUCHING OTHER SURFACES THAT HAVE COLD OR FLUVIRIS JUST REMIND YOU COLD VIRIS CAN EXIST UP TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS ON A GIVEN SURFACE FLUVIRISTANS TO DIE OFF AFTER ABOUT TWO HOURS ON A GIVEN SURFACE AND WE'RE BRINGING THAT TO OUR FACE WE ARE LITTERALLY BRINGING THE VIRIS TO OURSELVES SO A LITTLE BIT MORE CONSCIOUS A WARENESS ABOUT THAT FACT MEANS THAT YOU CAN PROBABLY AVOID COLDS AND FLUES TO SOME EXTENT HOW MUCH WELL IT'S UNCLEAR IT'S UNCLEAR BECAUSE AS YOU RECALL SOME PEOPLE HAVE AND ARE PASSING ALONG COLD OR FLUVIRIS PRIOR TO ANY SYMPTOMS AND OF COURSE IT'S POSSIBLE THAT YOU CAN WALK INTO AN ARISALL CLOUD OF COLD OR FLUVIRIS EVEN IF A PERSON ISN'T THERE AND YOU DON'T COME INTO CONTACT WITH THEM BUT SOMECONSCIOUS AWARENESS OF THESE ROUTS OF PASSAGE FOR THE COLAR FLUVRIS I DO BELIEVE CAN REDUCE THE PROBABILITY THAT YOU WILL CATCH A COLD OR FLUE AND OF COURSE I'M NOT ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO NEVER TOUCH TOUCHES AN IMPORTANT PART OF SOCIAL CONNECTION AND SOCIAL BONDING BUT IF YOU START TO THING ABOUT THESE PORTALS OF ENTRY FOR THE COLDS AND FLUVIRIS INTO YOUR BODY WELL THEN YOU YOU DON'T PERHAPS MIGHT THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU KNOW HUGGING SOME ONE KISSING THEM ON THE CHEEK DURING A TIME IN WHICH YOU'RE TRYING TO ACTIVELY AVOID GETTING THE COLD OR FLUE NOW I FEEL LITTLE BIT FUNNY ABOUT SHARING THIS INFORMATION BECAUSE AGAIN I DON'T WANT ENCOURAGE PEOPLES ALWAYS BE IT IU ARMS DISTANCE YOU N I YOU KNOW FAKEFISTSBUMPING AU KNOW KEEPING A GAP BETWEEN THEM AGAIN TOUCH ISNAN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF SOCIAL CONNECTION BUT SINCE TO DAY'S TOPIC IS COLDS AND FLUES AND HOW TO AVOID GETTING COLDS AND FLUES JUST LIKE YOU CAN'T GET EATEN BY A SHARK IF YOU DON'T GO IN THE OCEON THERE'S A MUCH LOWER PROBABILITY THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET A COLD OR FLUE IF YOU ARE NOT TOUCHING A LOT OF HANDS AND BRINGING THOSE HANDS TO YOUR EYES NOSE OR MOUTH I SUPPOSE ONE WAY AROUND THE SORT OF DO I HUG DO I SHAKE HANDS THING IS TO JUST BE CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT WHEN YOU SHAKE SOMEBODY'S HAND THAT YOU ARE VERY LIKELY TO TOUCH YOUR EYES OR FACE WITHIN THE NEXT THIRTY SECONDS OR SO AND MAYBE YOU AND UP BEING THAT PERSON WHO PUTSOME HAND SANATIZER ON YOUR HANDS SOMETIMES THAT CAN FEEL LAWKWARD TO DO THAT RAIN FRONT OF SOMEBODY YOU KNOWS CONSENDING A SIGNAL LIE HAND WANT YOU TO INFECT ME BUT GUESS WHAT YOU D WANT THEM TO INFECT YOU OKE LET'S IMAGINE THAT A COLDER FLUE VIRUS MAKES IT INTO YOUR SYSTEM IT BREACHES THE PHYSICAL BARRIER OF YOUR SKIN AND MUCOSAL LINING NOW YOU HAVE IN MIND ALL THE DFERENT WAYS THAT COULD HAPPEN AND ALL THE DIFERENT WYS THAT COULD BE PREVENTED BUT WE ARE STARTING AT A POINT HERE A HYPOTHETICAL POINT WHEREBY THAT COLDER FLUE VIRUS HAS MADE IT INTO YOUR BODY YOUR IMMIUNE SYSTEM HAS AN ABSOLUTELY EXQUISITELY SOPHISTICATED WAY OF KNOWING YOU VERSES OTHER MEANING CELLS WITHIN YOUR BODY THAT ARE OF YOU AND CELLS OF YOUR BODY THAT ARE FROM OTHER ORGANISMS OR VIRUSES FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND WHEN VIRUSIS SUCH AS A COLD OR FLUVIRUS ARE DETECTED IN YOUR BODY YOUR BODY MIGHT NOT EVEN RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S A COLD OR FLUVRUS IT MAGHT NOT EVEN RECOGNIZE HA ITS AVIRUS AT ALL IT JUST KNOWS THAT THIS THING THAT'S IN ME IS OF OTHER IT'S NOT ME I'VE NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE THIS IS NOT ME THESE ARE NOT MY CELLS THESE ARE NOT THE CHEMICALS THAT I'M PRODUCING AND YOURMUNE SYSTEM IS AMAZING IN THAT WAY AND WHEN IT OCCURS YOUR INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM LAUNCHES A RESPONSE WHAT IS THAT RESPONSE WELL FIRST OF ALL THE RESPONSE IS VERY RAPID RIGHT COLDER FLUE MAKES IT INTO YOUR BODY AND YOUR INATE IMUNE SYSTEM IMMEDIATELY OR NEAR IMMEDIATELY LAUNCHES AN ATTACK ON THAT INVADER OR INVADERS BECAUSE AS SOON AS THE VIRUS GETS IN YOUR BODY IT'S GOING TO START REPLICATING AS QUICKLY AS IT CAN WHAT HAPPENS WHITE BLOOD CELLS THAT YOUR BODY PRODUCES WILL GO TO THE CITES WHERE THOSE VIRUSES ARE AND THE BY THE WY THOSE VIRUSES ARE BASICALLY GETTING INTO CELLS OF YOUR BODY AND THEN HYGH JACKING THE GENETIC MACHINERY OF THOSE CELLS IN ORDER TO REPLICATE WITHIN THOSE CELLS AND THEN EGGS IT THOSE CELLS AND THEN GO IN FACT MORE CELLS THAT'S HOW THESE VIRUSIS WORK YOUR BODIES MAKING WHITE BLOOD CELLS THINGS LIKE NEUTRAFILLS NATURAL KILLER CELLS MACROPHAGES THESE ARE WHAT WE CALL EFFECTOR CELLS THAT ACT AS A KIND OF IMBULENT SYSTEM AND GO TO THE SITES THAT THOSE VIRUSES EXIST AND THE CELLS THAT THEY'VE INFECTED AND START TRING TO PHYSICALLY BARRIER THEM IN AND ALSO YOU SPECIFIC CHEMICAL MECHANISMS TO NEUTRALIZE AND KILL THOSE VIRUSES AGAIN ANY TIME YOU THINK OFTHAT BIOLOGY THINK MECHANICAL FEATURES AND CHEMICAL FEATURES OF A RESPONSE NOW A KEY COMPONET OF THE INNATE AMUNE SYSTEM IS WHAT'S CALLED THE COMPLEMENT SYSTEM NOT COMPLEMENT LIKE ALL YOU LOOK VERY NICE TO DAY BUT COMPLEMENT OKE THE COMPLEMENT SYSTEM WHICH EXISTS IN THE PLASMA WITHIN YOUR BLOOD THESE ARE CHEMICALS IN YOUR BLOOD STREAM THAT GO AND MARK SPECIFIC CELLS THAT HAVE BEEN INFECTED OR VIRUSES WITH A SIGNAL A CHEMICAL SIGNAL THAT ESSENTIALLY LOOKS LIKE AN EAT ME SIGNAL TO THESE OTHER CELL TYPES OF YOURIMMUNE S SYSTEM SUCH THAT THOSE NATURAL KILLER CELLS GO THROUGH THE BODY AND GO LOOKING FOR THE CELLS THAT HAVE THIS EAT ME SIGNAL ON THEM AND TRY AND DESTROY THOSE PARTICULAR CELLS THE OTHER THING THAT YOU'RE ANATEOMIANE SYSTEM DOES IS THAT THE CELLS THAT HAVE BEEN INFECTID AND THAT ARE UNDERGOING DAMAGE REMEMBER THEY HAVE COLD OR FLUVIRUS WITHIN THEM IN THEIR HIH JACKING THE CELLER MACHINERY OF THOSE CELLS AND USING IT TO PRODUCE THEIR OWN VIRUS MORE OF THE VIRUS ND AS A CONSEQUENCE THE GENETIC MACHINERY OF THOSE CELLS IS NOT ABLE TO DO A BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS THAT IT NORMALLY CAN DO OR T LEAST NOT AS WELL WELL THOSE CELLS THAT ARE REALLY HURTING RELEASE A HELP ME SIGNAL AND THEN IN RESPONSE TO THAT HELP ME SIGNAL YOURIMUNE SYSTEM RELEASE S WHAT ARE CALLED CIDAKINDS THINGS LIKE INTERLUKIN ONE INTERLUCAN SIX TUMERNACROSIS FACT OR ALVA JUST FANCY NERDSPEAK NAMES FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF MOLECULES THAT GO TO THE SIDE OF INFECTION AND TRY TO HELP OR ASSIST TO REMOVE THAT INFECTION AND THEY ALSO TRY TO ASSIST THE REPAIR OF THE CELLS THAT HAVE BEEN INFECTED BY THOSE VIRUSES NOW ONE OF THE MECHANICAL OR PHYSICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THESE CHEMICAL SIGNALS LIKE INTERLUCAN ONE INTERLUCANSIX TANEFF ALF AGAIN THOSE ARE ALL CYDOCINES BEING DRAWN TO A PARTICULAR CELL OR REGION OF CELLS THAT HAVE BEEN INFECTED IS THAT IT CREATE SOME PHYSICAL SWELLING OF THE AREA IT IMPACTS THE VASCULATURE THE VEINS AND CAPILARIES THAT FEED THAT AREA AND IN RESPONSE THAT THEY PUT MORE BLOOD THERE SO OUT GET SOME SWELLING OR YOU'LL GET IN SOME CASES THE RELEASE OF HISTEMINES RIGHT WE THNK OF ANTI HISTEMINE DRUGS WELL HISTEMINES ARE AN ASPECT OF YOURIMUNE SYSTEM THEY MOVE AROUND IN YOUR BODY IN THESE REALLY COLCELLS CALLS MAST CELLS AND MAASTE MASCELLS TAND WHEN THE HISTEMINES ARE RELEASED THAT ARE BECOMES CONE OF HOT AND SWELLING IT'S WHAT WE CALL EDEMA AND THAT WHOLE AREAS MARKED AS REALLY A SITE JUST LIKE A CRASHSIDE ON THE SIDE OF THE ROADS LIKE HEY WE'VE GOT EAT ME SIGNALS TO GET THE DEBRIS IN THE BAD STUFF OUT OF HERE TRY GET THOSE VIRUSES OUT OF HERE WE'VE GOT HELP ME SIGNALS TO TRY AND HELP THE INJURED CELLS JUST LIKE YOU OULD TRY AND HELP PEOPLE AT A CAR CRASH AND THERE'S A BUNCH OF SWELLING SO THERE'S ADDITIONAL BLOOD FLOW SOMETIMES THERE SOME OTHER PHYSICAL FEATURES AS WELL NOW THE IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW IS THAT THE INATE MIUNE SYSTEM IS VERY FAST AND IT IS IGNOSTIC TO THE TYPE OF INFECTION IN FACT IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER IF IT'S OF BACTERIAL PHYSICAL FUNGAL OR VIRAL INFECTION BUT IT CERTAINLY ISN'T PAYING ATTENTION TO THE EXACT CEROTYPE OF COLD VIRUS OR WHETHER NOT'S AN EACH ONE INFLUENCE OR ANOTHER TYPE OF INFLUENZA SO THE WAY TO THING ABOUT THE INATOMIUNE SYSTEM IS THAT IT IS A VERY FAST AND NON SPECIFIC RESPONSE TO A VIRAL OR OTHER TYPE OF INVADER NOW THAT'S ALL A BUNCH OF BIOLOGY BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT LET'S IMAGINE A SENAREO WERE U GO TO A PARTY HANG OUT THE PARTY YOU ON'T SEE ANY ONE COUGHING OR SNEEZING BUT MAYBE ONE PERSON THERE HAS A COLD VIRUS OR THEY HAVE A FLUVIRUS AND THEY AREN'T EVEN AWARE OF IT THEY'RE NOT CON TO COME DOWN THE SYMPTOMS FOR ANOTHER DAY OR SO YOU TALK TO THAT PERSON YOU SHAKE HANDS IF YOU TEUCH YOUR EYES MAYBOU DON'T BUT YOU'RE EXPOSED TO THAT COLD OR FLUVIRUS YOU HOME YO SLEEP YOU WAKE UP THE NEXT MORNINGYOU FEEL FINE AND THEN SOMETIME THE NEXT AFTERNOON ANE STRIT FEELL TICKLE IN YOUR THROAT O SAR TO FEEL JUST A LITTLE BIT OF FATIGUE OR MALAYS DO YOU HAVE THAT COLDER FLUE WELL POSSIBLY I YET WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE BUT ASSUMING THAT THAT COLDER FLU VIRIS DIDN'T NEED MAKE IT INTO YOUR SYSTEM THEN YOU'RE INNATE MUNE SYSTEM IS STARTING TO CREATE A SET OF RESPONSES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT A MOMENT AGO BUT IT ALSO TENDS TO IMPACK THINGS THAT THE LEVEL OF YOUR BRAIN SUCH THAT YOU CAN'T FEEL LIKE AND I DON'T FEEL QUITE RIGHT I FEEL LIKE A LITTLE BIT I DON'T FEEL GREAT AND THERE A LOT OF REASONS WHY YOU WOULD FEEL THAT WAY ANDWE'LL TALK ABOUT THOSE REASONS A LIBIT LADER BUT DOES THAT MEAN THAT YOU'RE NECESSARILY COMING DOWN WITH A COLDER FLUE WELL TECHNICALLY YES YOU'RE INNATEMUNE SYSTEM AS DEPLOYED TO FIGHT THIS FOREIGN VIRAL INVADER BUT WETHER OR NOT YOU ACTUALLY GET A FULL BLOWN COLDER FLUE OR PUT DIFFERENTLY HOW SEVERE THAT COLDER FLUE INFECTION IS DEPENDS ON WHETHER NOT YOUR INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM CAN FIGHT OFF THAT COLDER FLUE AT THE OUTSET AND INDEED THERE MANY CASES WE BELIEVE WHERE YOU GET EXPOSED TO A COLDER FLUE IT MAKES IT INTO YOUR BODY BUT YOU'R INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM IS SUFFICIENT TO BEAT IT TO FIGHT IT BACK THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT IF YOU'RE STARTING TO FEEL A BIT UNDER THE WEATHER AND YOU THINK YOU'RE COMING DOWN WITH A COLDER FLUE THAT YOU DO CERTAIN THINGS IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM IS BOTH READY AND THAT IT CAN LAUNCH A FULL SCALE ATTACK ON THAT COLDER FLUE VIRUS WE'RE IN A TALK ABOUT HOW TO DO THAT ALUBIT LATER I'M NOT TRYING TO WITHHOLD IT'S JUST IT'S IMPORTANT T UNDERSTAND THAT JUST BECAUSE THE VIRUS MAKES IT INTO YOUR BODY DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT YOU'RE GING TO GET A FULL BLOWN COLDER FLUE AND IN FACT THAT INNATIMUNE SYSTEM SOMETIMES IS SUFFICIENT TO PREVENT THAT COLDER FLUE FROM REPPLICATING ENOUGH THAT YOU GET THE FULL BLOWN SET OF SYMPTEMS AND THAT'S KIND OF AN IDEAL SENARIO SO WE'RE DEFILING GON TO TALK TO DAY ABOUT WHAT TO DO IF YOU START TO FEEL A LITTLE BIT OF MALAYS WHAT TO DO IF YOU DISCOVER THAT OH YOU KOW THAT PERSON I WAS HANGIN OUT WITH AT THE PARTY THE NIGHT BEFORE THEY'RE REALLY SICK WITH A COLDER FLUE BECAUSE THERE ARE THINGS YOU CAN DO TO INCREASE THE PROBABILITY THAT YOUR INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM CAN HANDLE THE BATTLE SUFFICIENTLY SUCH THAT YOU NEVER HAVE TO GET TO THE NEXT COMPONENT OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSE WHICH IS THE ADAPT OF IMMUNE RESPONSE I LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND THANK OUR SPONSOR INSIDE TRACKER INSIDE TRACKER IS A PERSONALIZED NUTRITIAN PLATFORM THAT ANALYZES DATA FROM YOUR BLOOD ENDIANE TO HELP YOU BETTER UNDERSTAND YOUR BODY AND HELP YOU REACH YOUR HEALTH COLS I'VE LONG BEEN A BELIEVER IN GETTING REGULAR BLOOD WORK DON FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT MANY OF THE FACTORS THAT IMPACT YOUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM HEALTH CAN ONLY BE ANALYZED FROM A QUALITY BLOOD TAST I MADE YOUR PROBLEM WITH A LOT OF BLOOD TEST OUT THERE HOWEVER IS THAT YOU GET INFORMATION BACK ABOUT METABOLIC FACTORS LIPIDS AND HORMONES AND SO FORTH BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THAT INFORMATION WITH INSIDE TRACKER THEY MAKE IT VERY EASY BECAUSE THEY HAVE A PERSONALIZED PLATFORM THAT ALLOWS YOU TO SEE THE LEVELS OF ALLDTHOSE THINGS METABOLIC FACTORS LIPIDS HORMONES ET CETERA BUT IT GIVES YOU SPECIFIC DIRECTIVES THAT YOU CAN FOLLOW THAT RELATE TO NUTRITIAN BEHAVIORAL MODIFICATION SUPPLEMENTS ET CETERA THAT CAN HELP YOU BRING THOSE NUMBERS INTO THE RANGES THAT ARE OPTIMAL FOR YOU IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY INCIDE TRACTER YOU CAN GO TO INSIDE TRACKER DOC CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET TWENTY PER CENT OFF ANY OF INSIDE TRACTER'S PLANS AGAIN THAT'S INSIDE TRACKER DOC CAM SLASH HUBERMEN O CASE OF THE THIRD LAYER OF YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM IS OUR ADAPTIVE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND THIS IS AN AMAZING ASPECT OF YOU  THE SELF WE TALK ABOUT UP UNTIL NOW THE PHYSICAL BARRIER THE INATEMUNE SYSTEM SO SO COOL BUT THE ADAPT OF IMMIUNE SYSTEM IS REALLY A MIND BLOWER THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT YOUR ADAPTOF IMMUNE SYSTEM IS THAT AS THE NAME SUGGESTS ITS JOP IS TO CREATE ANTOBODIES SPECIFIC TO THE VERY INTRUDER THAT MADE IT INTO YOU AND INFECTED YOUR SELLES THE VERY SPECIFIC SEROTYPE OF COLVIRIS THE VERY SPECIFIC TYPE OF INFLUENZA SUCH THAT YOU DEFEAT THAT VIRIS BUT THEN IN AN AMAZING WAY YOUR ADAPT F IMMUNE SYSTEM ALSO MAINTAINS A MEMORY OF THAT BATTLE AND KEEPS WITHIN YOUR BODY BELIEVE IT OR NOT WITHIN A POPTULATION OF STEMCELLS WHICH ARE SELLS THAT CAN VRISE TO MORE CELLS SUCH THAT IF YOU EVER ENCOUNTER THAT SAME SEROTYPE OF COLDVIRIS OR SAME STRAIN OF INFLUENZA AGAIN THAT YOUR ANTEBODIES CAN IMMEDIATELY NEUTRALIZE THAT COLDER FLUVIRIS THE ADAPT OF IMMUE SYSTEM HAS THE ABILITY TO MAKE PROTENES THAT HAVE A PARTICULAR SHAPE ON THEIR SURFACE THAT MATCHES THE SHAPE OF THE THING THAT OURIMUNE SYSTEM IS TRYING TO KILL NOW THE ADAPT OF IMMUNE SYSTEM HAS TWO BASIC PHASES IN THE FIRST PHASE THE ADAPT OF IMMUNE SYSTEM MAKES THESE THINGS CALLED IMMUNOGULOBULENCE IGS AND THE IMMUNIA GLOBULENCE COMINGDIFFERENT FORMS THES IG G THERE'S IG M THEIR OTHER TYPES OF IGESUS WELL FOR SAKE OF TO DAY'S DISCUSSION KNOW THAT THE INITIAL WAVE OF ANTEBODIES THAT THE ADAPTOF IMMUNE SYSTEM MAKES ARE OF THE IG M VARIETY N THE IGEUM ANTOBODIES CAN TRAVEL TO AND LATCH ON TO THE SURFACE OF THE COLDR FLUVIRIS AND IT MATCHES IT PRETTY WELL IT'S NOT PERFECT BUT IT MATCHES IT PRETTY WELL THINK ABOUT OF FOR IN SENCE OF PARTICULAR SERATYPE OF COLD VIRIS OR THE AH ONE AND ONE FLUVRIS HAVING IN A VERY PARTICULAR CONTOUR ON ITS SURFACE THE IGEM APPROXIMATES THAT CONTOUR SUCH THAT IT'S BETTERAT FIGHTING THAT COLDOR FLUVIRIS THAN IS THE INATE IMMIUNE SYSTEM BUT IT'S NOT A PERFECT FIT HOWEVER THE ADAPT OF IMMUNE SYSTEM DOESN'T STOP WITH THE PRODUCTION OF THOSE IGEEMS THE ADAPT OF MMUNE SYSTEM TAKES THAT INFORMATION ABOUT HOW PRECISE OR INPRECISE THAT FIT IS BETWEEN THE IGEEMIANABODIES AND THE SURFACE OF THAT PARTICULAR COLDOR FLUVIRIS AND THEN IN AN AMAZING WAY SEND SIGNALS BACK TO THE STEMCELL POPULATIONS IN THE BONE MARRO AND OTHER TISSUES AND THEN MORE ANTEBODIES COME OUT OF THE IG G VARIETY AND THE IG G PROTI S ARE VERY SPECIFIC TO THE SHAPE OF THAT PARTICULAR COLD VIRUS OR FLUVIRS SUCH THAT THE IGES THEN CAN DEBIND TO AND NEUTRALIZE THOSE VIRAL PARTICLES HE SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE IMMIUNE SYSTEM WERE TALKING ABOUT A PHYSICAL BARRER THAT IF IT IS BREACHED A COLD OR FLUVIRUS TAKES RESIDENCE AND STARTS TO REPLICATE THE INNATE IMUNE SYSTEM LAUNCHES AT GENERALIZED ATTACK ON THAT COLDOR FLUVIRUS AND THEN THE ADAPT OF IMMUNE SYSTEM KICKS IN USUALLY COUPLE DAYS LADER FIRST WITH THE PRODUCTION OF ANTOBODIES THAT ARE PRETTY SPECIFIC TO  THE PARTICULAR VIRUS THAT HAPPEN TO MAKE IT INTO THE BODY AND INFECT CELLS BUT THEN THERE'S A SECOND WAVE OF PRODUCTION OF ANTIBODIES AND THOSE ANTIBODIES ARE INCREDIBLY SPECIFIC FOR THAT PARTICULAR COLD OR FLUVIRUS AND AS I MENTION EARLIER THE ADAPT OF IMMUNE SYSTEM THEN ACQUIRERS A MEMORY OF THE SPECIFIC FIT BETWEEN A GIVEN ANTOBODY THAT IT MADE AND THE VIRAL INVADER AND THE SUCCESSFUL BATTLE THAT THOSE ANTOBODIES WAGED ON THAT VIRAL INVADER AND THAT MEMORY IS MAINTAIN SUCH THAT IF THE NEXT WEEK ERE THE NEXT SEASON YOU ENCOUNTER THE EXACT SAME CERATYPE OF COLD VIRUS OR SAME TYPE OF FLUVIRUS WILL THEN YOU ALREADY HAVE ANTABODIES READY TO BE DEPLOYED SOMETIMES THE ANTABODIES CONTINUE TO CIRCULATE IN YOUR SYSTEM SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO GENERATE MORE OF THEM AND THE UMIAN SYSTEM IS THAT AMAZING IT CAN ACTUALLY SEND A MESSAGE BACK TO THAT STEM CELL POPULATION IN THE BONE MAROR OR ELSEWHERE SAY HEY LISTEN THIS VIRUS THAT WE BEAT A FEW WEEKS OR MONTHS OR YEARS BACK ITS BACK WE NEED MORE ANABODIES AND BOOM YOUR ADAPT OF IMUUN SYSTEM CHURNS THOSE ANTABODIES OUT AND KILLS THE VIRUS NOW IT'S A FINAL POINT ABOUT THE IMMUNE SYSTEM I'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT TODAY ABOUT SELLS TRAVELLING TO AN KILLING VIRU SYSAND SENDING SIGNALS EAT ME HELP ME ET CETERA IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT WHILE SELLS CAN MIGRATE THROUGH THE BODY A LOT OF WHAT WERE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS THE MOVEMENT OF PROTENES THROUGH THE VASCULAR THROUGH THE BLOOD SYSTEM OF THE VODY BUT THERE'S ANOTHER SYSTEM THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF THIS THAT'S COLLABORATING WITH THE VASCULAR SYSTEM AND THAT'S THE LEMPHATIC SYSTEM WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO IN TO A WHOLE LECTURE ABOUT THE LEMPHATIC SYSTEM BUT SUFFICE TO SAY THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM CAN PULL STUFF FROM THE BLOOD SUCH AS VIRUSES BUT ALSO CELLS THAT HAVE BEEN BEATEN UP OR CELLS THAT HAVE BEEN EATEN AND ARE CONTAINED WITHIN OTHER CELLS SUCH AS MACRIPHAGES AND IT CAN DO SOME FILTERING OF THOSE DIFFERENT CELL TYPES AND IT CAN PRODUCE ITS OWN USEFUL CHEMICALS THAT THEN CAN BE REINTRODUCED TO THE BLOOD STREAM IN ORDER TO HELP COMBAT THE INFECTION NOW THIS BECOMES VERY IMPORTANT WHEN LATER WE TALK ABOUT HOW SPECIFIC FORMS INTENSITIES AND DURATIONS OF EXERCISE CAN INCREASE THE ABILITY FOR YOUR INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO COMBAT INFECTIONS SO THAT YOUR ADAPTOF IMIUNE SYSTEM PERHAPS DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO GET INVOLVED IN THE BATTLE BECAUSE YOUR INNATE SYSTEM HANDLED IT THERE ARE DATA TO SHOW THE EXERCISE OF SUFFICIENT INTENSITY IN DURATION BUT NOT EXCESSIVE INTENSITY AND DURATION CAN RECRUIT THE LEMPHATIC SYSTEM AND RECRUIT OR INCREASE THE ACTIVITY OF THE INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF AN INFECTION SUCH THAT IF YOU GO TO THAT PARTY IN YOU ENCOUNTER THAT PERSON WITH A COLDER FLUE YOU CAN DEFEAT THAT COLDER FLUVIRUS AT THE OUTSET AND NEVER HAVE TO DEAL WITH MAKING ANTIBODIES THAT COLDER FLUVIRIS AT ALL O CASEO NOW YOU OF A FAIRLY SOPHISTICATED BIOLOGICAL UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT COLDS ARE WHAT FLUES ARE AND THE WAY THAT YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM WORKS TO FIGHT OFF VIRUSES LIKE COLDS AND FLUES SO WITH THAT IN MINE I THINK NOW'S THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO START TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE SCIENTIFIC PURREVUED RESEARCH SAYS ABOUT HOW TO A LOW YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM TO FUNCTION AT ITS BEST SUCH THAT YOU CAN COMBAT COLDS AND FLUES MEANING IF YOU ARE EXPOSED TO A COLD OR FLUE THAT IS IF IT BREACHES THAT PHYSICAL BARRIER OF YOUR SKIN AND THE MUCOSAL LINING OF YOUR NOSE YOUR MOUTH OR GETS INTO YOUR EYES THAT YOU STAND THE GREATEST CHANCE OF DEFEATING THAT COLD OR FLUE AT THE LEVEL OF YOUR INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM SUCH THAT YOUR ADAPT OF IMUNE SYSTEM NEVER EVEN HAS TO RESPOND TO IT BY CREATING ALL THOSE SPECIFIC ANTIBODIES NOW FORTUNATELY THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERT THINGS WE CAN DO TO IMPROVE THE FUNCTION OF OUR MUNE SYSTEM IN FACT I FEEL LIKE ANY TIME THE WINTER MONTHS ROLL AROUND WE SART TO SEE THE SAME LIST OF THING SURFACE ON LINE AND IN THE PRESS AND I DON'T WANT TO DIMINISH THESE THINGS THEY ARE IN FACT THE BED ROCK OF MAINTAINING AND INHANCING THE FUNCTION OF YOUR INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM SO WHAT ARE THOSE WELL SOME OF THESE WILL BE PRETTY OBVIOUS THINGS LIKE GETTING ENOUGH QUALITY SLEEP EACH NIGHT WE KNOW FOR INSTANCE THAT IF YOUR SLEEP DEPRIVED SO ESPECIAL IF YOU STAY UP ALL NIGHT BUT CERTAINLY EVEN IF YOU ONLY GET FIF TE PERCENT OR SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF YOUR SLEEP REQUIREMENT THAT YOUR INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM IS GOING TO SOFFER ITS NOT GOING TO BE AS EFFECTIVE IT COMBATING FLUES OR COLDS IN ADDITION TO THAT WE KNOW THAT EXERCISE OF SPECIFIC TYPE AND SPECIFIC DURATION AND SPECIFIC INTENSITY CAN SERVE TO BOLSTER TE INNATE MMUNE SYSTEM AND WILL TALK ABOUT THE SPECIFIC EXERCISE PROTOCALS THAT CAN BEST ACHIEVE THAT WE ALSO HERE AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE THAT WE NEED ADEQUATE NUTRITION IF WE ARE IN A COLORIC DEFICIT FOR INSTANCE IF WERE TRYING TO DIET THROUGH THE WINTER MONTHS WHICH MANY PEOPLE TRID TO DO THACT CAN PLACE OUR INATE IMMUNE SYSTEM IN A BIT OF A COMPROMISE STATE THAT SAID THINGS LIKE INTERMITTEN FASTING OR EVEN LONGER DURATION FAST HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED AND HERE I REALLY WANT O UNERSCORE IMPLICATED IN BRIEF IMPROVEMENTS IN THE FUNCTION OF THE INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM HOWEVER EXTENDED FAST OR NOT EATING ENOUGH CALORIES TO MAINTAIN BODYWEIGHT FOR MANY MANY DAYS IN A ROW CAN ACTUALLYED COMPROMISE THE FUNCTION OF THE INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM I'LL GO INTO THIS A BIT DEEPER IN A MOMENT AND THEN OF COURSE WE HEARE ABOUT STRESS THAT WERE ALL SPOSE TO REGULATE OUR LEVELS OF STRESS NOT GET TO STREST AND HERE I HAVE TO PUT AN ASTRICT NEXT TO THOSE STATEMENTS BECAUSE YES INDEED CHRONIC STRESS MEANING STRESS THAT CONTINUES DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY OR EVEN SHORT PERIODS OF STRESS THAT IMPED OUR ABILITY TO SLEEP AT NIGHT CAN INDEED REDUCE THE FUNCTIONIG OF OUR INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM HOWEVER IT'S ALSO CLEAR THAT SHORT BOUTS OF STRESS PROVIDED THAT THEY DON'T INHIBIT OUR ABILITY TO SLEEP THAT NIGHT CAN ACTUALLY INHANCE THE FUNCTION OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I DON'T THINK ITS TALKED ABOUT ENOUGH YOU KNOW WE HEAR SO OFTEN THAT COTINCORTES LL IS BAD IT'S A STRESS HORMENT LISTEN CORTES ALL IS FANTASTIC PROVIDED THAT IT IS ELEVATED EARLY IN THE DAY AND NOT LATE IN THE DAY OR EVENING ALSO CORTES ALL DOES HAVE THRESHOLDS BEYOND WHICH IF IT'S TOO HIGH CAN BE BAD FOR US BUT IT'S ALSO THE CASE THAT IF CORTIS ALL LEVELS ARE TOO LOW THAT'S BAD FOR US AND IT'S ESPECIALLY BAD FOR THE FUNCTIONING OR VERMUNE SYSTEM BECAUSE GLUCO CORTICORDS OF WHICH CORTIS ALL IS HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE INACTIVATING THOSE NATURAL KILLER CELLS OF THE INATEIMUNE SYSTEM THEY ARE ONE OF THE PRIMARY SIGNALS BY WHICH THOSE INTERLUCANS LIKE INTERLUCAN ONE AND INTERLUCAN SIX ARE DEPLOYED IN OUR BODY AND SO VERY OFTEN WILL HEAR STRESS INCREASES INFLAMMATION AND INDEED INTERLUCAN ONE INTERLUCAN SIX OR PRO INFLAMMATORY YOU MIGHT THINK OMAGANUS I DONT WANT THAT I WANT CORTIS ALL I DON'T WANT THESE INTERLUCANS ELEVATED BUT GUESS WHAT THE INFLAMMATION RESPONSE IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THAT INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS US TO COMBAT INFECTIONS SO IN TRYING TO KEEP OUR NET OF MUNE SYSTEM TUNED UP I REALIZE THAT'S NOT A BIOLOGICAL TATEMENT TUNED UP BUT KEEP OUR MUNE SYSTEM FUNCTIONING AT ITS BEST WE WANT INFLAMMATION AVAILABLE AS A TOOL TO COMBAT INFECTION WE WANT CORTES ALL AVAILABLE AS A WAY TO ACTIVATE THAT INFLAMMATION AND OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM WE JUST DON'T WANT SO MUCH CORTES ALL AND SO MUCH INFLAMMATION THAT WE CAN'T SLEEP AND THAT OUR GOT MICROBIOM SUFFERS AND THAT BRINGS ME TO THE OTHER COMPONENT THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE BASIC FUNCTIONING OF YOUR NATE IMMUNE SYSTEM SO THAT YOU CAN BE AT YOUR STRONGEST WHEN YOU INEVITABLY ENCOUNTER THOSE COLD AND FLUVIRUSES WHY DO I SAY INEVITABLY THE F YOU EXIST IN THE WORLD THAT IS IF YOU LIVE ON PLANET EARTH YOU ARE GOING TO BE BUMBARDED WITH DIFFERENT VIRUSES AND BACTERIA AND FUNGASISN ALL THE STUFF THROUGHOUT YOUR DAYS AND YES IN THOSE WINTER MONTHS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SPENDING MORE TIME INDOORS AND THERE TOUCHING EACH OTHER AND SURFACES MORE BREATHING ON EACH OTHER MORE SNEEZING ON EACH OTHER MORE AND SO ON AND SO FORTH THERE IS MORE PROPAGATION OF COLDS AND FLUES SO WE TAKE A STEP BACK AND WE ASK HOW CAN I HAVE MY IMUNE SYSTEM AS STRONG AND READY AS POSSIBLE TO COMBAT COLD AND FLUVIRA SYST WE GET TO THOSE BASICS IT'S MAKE SURE YOU'RE GETTING ENOUGH QUALITY SLEEP EACH NIGHT HOW MUCH IS ENOUGH HOWEVER MUCH YOU NEED IN ORDER TO NOT FEEL SLEEPY DURING THE DAY EXCEPT MAY BE THE REQUIREMENT FOR A SHORT NAP OF ANYWHERE FROM TEN TO THIRTY MINUTES NOT EVERYONE REQUIRES THAT BUT THAT'S PERFECTLY NORMAL TO HAVE AN AFTERNOON DIP IN ENERGY THAT CAN BE RESTORED WITH THE SHORT NAP OR NON SLEEP DE BREAST WILL PROVIDE LINKS TO NON SLEEP DEE BREAST AND OTHER TOOLS IN THE SHOWN O CAPTIONS THAT YOU KNOW OUR ZEROCOST TOOLS TO ALLOW YOU TO RECOVER YOUR ENERGY SOME PEOPLE TUST SIMPLY TAKE A NAP IN THAT SORT OF THING IF YOU WANT TOOLS FOR IMPROVING YOUR SLEEP AND MAKING SURE THAT YUR GETTING ENOUGH QUALITY SLEEP EACH NIGHT WE ALSO PROVIDE A LINGTARIS EUROCOSTS SLEEP TOOL KIT THAT DETAILS THAT IN PEDI FORM IN JUST LISTS OUT THE THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO OR TAKE IF THAT'S YOUR CHOICE AND SO ON AND SO FORTH AND OF COURSE WE'VE DONE EPISODES ON QUALITY NUTRITION AND WHAT THAT MEANS WE'VE DONE EPISODES ON STRES AND HOW TO COMBAT STRESS AND WE'VE DONE EPISODES ON THE SO CALLE GOT MICROBIOM BUT RIGHT NOW I JUST WANT TO MENTION THAT THE GOT MICROBIUM WHICH ARE THE TRULIANS OF LITTLE MICROBACTERIA THAT INTERACT HEAVILY WITH THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND HELP SUPPORT THE MUNSYSTEM YOU WANTO KEEP THE GUT MICROBIUM HEALTHY SO YOU'LL NOTICE THAT WE INCLUDE SOME TOOLS RELATE TO THE GUT MICROBIUM HERE IN A MOMENT AND AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT KEEP IN MIND THAT THE MICROBIUM DOESN'T JUST EXIST IN THE GUT SO OFTEN THESE DAYS WE HEAR ABOUT THE  GOT MICROBIUM AND I'M O SO HAPPY THAT THE GOT MICROBIUM IS GETTING THE ATTENTION THAT IT DESERVES IN THE CONTECTS OF MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE BUT WE CAN'T FORGET THAT THE MICROBIUM ALSO EXISTS ON THE SURFACE OF THE EYES AND IN THE NASAL PASSAGES AND INDEED THE MICROBIUM THAT SPECIFIC TO THE NASAL PASSAGES AS I MENTION BEFORE IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE MICROBIUM THAT EXIST WITHIN THE MOUTH AND THE MICROBIUM THAT EXISTS WITHIN THE MUCOS OF THE NASAL PASSAGES SEEMS TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE AT COMBATING ANY VIRUSES THAT WE ENCOUNTER ESPECIALLY COLD AND FLUVIRUS IS SO WILL IDEALLY U WOULD NEVER ENCOUNTER A COLDER FLUVIRIS WE KNOW THAT IF THE COLDER FLUVIRUSES GOIN THROUGH THE NASAL PASSAGES YOU STAND THE GREATEST CHANCE OF COMBATING THAT PARTICULAR COLD OR FLUE SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN THIS IS WHERE I GET TO MAKE A STRONG PUSH FOR BEING A NASAL BREATHER CERTAINLY IN SLEEP YOU WANT TO BE A NASAL BREATHER BUT ALSO THROUGHOUT THE DAY UNLESS YOUR SPEAKING OR UNLESS YOUR EXERCISING HARD ENOUGH THAT YOU NEED TO BREATHE THROUGH YOUR MOUTH OR UNLESS YOUR EATING BEING A NASAL BREATHER IS KNOWN TO PROVIDE THE RIGHT MILLOU THE RIGHT ENVIRONMENT TO KEEP THAT NASAL MICROBIUM AT ITS HEALTHIEST AND TO PROMOTE THE DIVERSITY OF MICROBIODA IN THE NASAL PASSAGES THAT CAN BEST PROTECT YOU AGAINST COLDS AND FLUES AND HERE ARE GROWING NUMBER STUDIES THAT POINT TO THIS FACT I'LL PROVIDE A LINK TO ONE THAT I LIKE FORY MUCH WHICH ES ENTITLED ALTERATIONS AND ORL NASAL FERANGEAL MICROBIOTA AND SALEVARY PROTINES IN MOUTH BREATHING CHILDREN THIS IS BUT ONE STUDY POINTING TO THE FACT THAT BEING IN NASAL BREATHER IS A GOOD THING MOUTH BREATHING CHILDREN AND MOUTH BREATHING ADULTS MEANING CHILDREN AND ADULTS THAT DEFAULT TO MOUTH BREATHING TEND TO GET MORE INFECTIONS OF OF THE UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT INCLUDING COLDS IN FLUES CONSCIOUSLY FOCUSSING ON NASAL BREATHING IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THAT WE CAN ALL DO TO COMBAT ANY COLDS ARE FLUES THAT WE MIGHT ENCOUNTER SO EARLI ARE WE TALKED ABOUT TRYING TO AVOID TOUCHING YOUR EYES AT LEAST WITHOUT WASHING YOR HANDS FIRST WER SANITIZING YOUR HANDS FIRST AFTER YOU MEET SOMEBODY KEEPING A MIND THAT MOST PEOPLE DO THAT UNCONSCIOUSLY HERE WE ARE ALSO SAYING WHEN YOU ENTER A ROOM YOU'RE ANGINGOUT WITH PEOPLE YOU'RE WAITING FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION OR YOUR WORK ARE WALKING DOWN THE HALLWAY UNLESS YOU ARE EXERCISING HARD UNLESS YOU ARE TALKING TRY TO FOCUS ON BEING A NASAL BRETHEF THERE ARE BUNCH OF OTHER REASONS TO BE IN NASAL BREATHER AS WELL BUT THIS IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY ONES AND I'LL PROVIDE A LINK TO ANOTHER REFERENCE WHICH IS THE BOOK JAWS BY MY COLLEAGUES AT STAMFORD WHICH TALKS ABOUT NASAL BREATHING IN THE IMPORTANCE OF NASAL BREATHING BUT ALSO THE DEGREE TO WHICH CHILDREN AND ADULTS OPEN THEMSELVES UP TO INCREASE LEVELS OF VIRAL INFECTIONS AS WELL AS BACTERIAL INFECTIONS BUT VIRAL INFECTIONS IN PARTICULAR WHEN THEY RELY ON MOUTH BREATHING AND THE INCREDIBLE BENEFITS OF DOING THIS VERY SIMPLE ZERO COST THING OF WHENEVER YOU CAN CONSCIOUSLY REMEMBER TO BREATHING THROUGH YOUR NOSE AS OPPOSE TO BREATHING THROUGH YOUR MOUTH AND JUST AS AN ADDITIONAL POINT ABOUT NASALBREATHING BECAUSE I CAN'T RESIST TELLING YOU THIS I JUST THNK IT SO COOL SUCH AN INTERESTING ADAPTATION WHEN WE BREATH THROUGH OUR NOSE WE HEAT THE AIR IT AWAY THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE WAY WE HEAT THE AIR WHEN WE MOUTH BREATHE AND BY HEATING THE AIR THAT'S COMING INTO THE NASAL PASSAGES IT SHIFTS THE PROBABILITY THAT COLD OR FLUVIRUSES WILL SUCCESSFULLY IMBED IN THE MUCOSAL LINING AND INFECT THE UNDERLYING CELLS AND GET INTO THE OTHER SELLS AND TISSUES OF OUR BODY SO THIS WHOLE THING ABOUT NASAL BREATHING IS IMPORTANT AND EFFECTIVE AT THE LEVEL OF TEMPERATURE REGULATION OF THE MILIU WITHIN THE NOSE AND THEREFORE THE VIRUSIS THAT AND UP IN THE NOSE AS WELL AS THE MUCOSAL LINE IN THE CHEMICALS MADE BY THE MUCOSAL LINING AND AGAIN THE NOSE IS OF VERY DIFFERENT PLACE THEN THE MOUTH IN FACT I'LL PROVIDE A LINK TO YET ANOTHER PAPER AH WHICH IS ENTITLED HUMAN NASAL MICROBIOTA IT'S A REALLY INTERESTING PAPER ITSA SHEN INTERVIEW WITH THA SCIENTIST WHOSE EXPERT IN THE NASAL MICROBIOM TALKING ABOUT HOW THIS STRUCTURE WITHIN OUR NOSE REALLY IS THE PRIMARY DEFENSE SIGHT BY WHICH WE DESTROY POTENTIALLY INCOMING VIRASIS SO IF IT SOUNDS OVERLY SIMPLE JUST BREATHE THROUGH YOUR NOSE IT IS VERY SIMPLE BUT IT'S ALSO VERY EFFECTIVE NOW IT'S ALSO CLEARLY THE CASE THAT KEEPIN YOUR GUT MICROBIUM IS ADVANTAGEOUS FOR KEEPING YOUR INATE IMMUNE SYSTEM AT ITS MOST ROBUST LEVEL OF FUNCTIONING AND I SHOULD MENTION THAT YOU'R GUT MICROBIUM ISN'T JUST ABOUT YOUR STOMACH YOUNOWT WE HEAR THE WORD GOT WE THINK STOMACH BUT IT'S ACTUALLY THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF YOUR DIGESTIVE TRACT FROM YOUR MOUTH OUT THE OTHER END AND DIFFERENT MICROBIOTA EXIST AT DIFFERENT LOCATIONS ALONG THAT TRACT OF MUKOSA AND THERE ARE COUPLE THINGS THAT ONE CAN DO IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE GUT MICROBIUM IS BEST SUPPORTED ALONG THAT ENTIRE LENGTH THE FIRST ONE IS THAT AND THIS WAS COVERED ON THE EPISODE THAT WE DID WITH MY COLLE JUST IN SONUNBERG WHO IS A WORLD EXPERT IN THE GUTMICROBIUM AND THAT IS TO CONSUME ANYWHERE FROM TWO TO FORSERVINGS OF LOW SUGAR FORMENTED FOODS PER DAY SO THINGS LIKE SOUR CROUT THINGS LIKE KIMCHI THINGS LIKE KEEFER THINGS LIKE CUMBOCHA IT CAN BE A LITWL BIT OF WORK TO FIGURE OUT WHICH OF THESE YOU LIKE AND WHICH ONES YOUR WILLING TO CONSUME ON A REGULAR BASIS BUT IT'S VERY CLEA E THAT THE BRINE YOU KOW THAT AN A SALTY SOLUTION AROUND THE SOUR CROUT AND BY THE WAY WHEN I SAY SOUR CRAT WILL VERE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS THE TYPE THAT HAS TO BE REFRIGERATED IT CONTAINS WHAT ARE CALLED LIVE CULTURES AS OPPOSED TO THE SOUR CROT THAT CAN EXIST IN THE NONREFRIGERATED PORTION OF THE STORE OR PICKLES THAT ALSO HAVE THAT BRINE AND THAT HAVE TO BE KEPT IN THE REFRIGERATOR EVEN BEFORE THE'RE OPEN AND OF COURSE THINGS LIKE YOGAR WHICH HAVE ACTIVE LIVE CULTURES THOSE ARE THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO BEST SUPPORT THE DIVERSITY OF MICROBIODA ALONG THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE GOT MICROBIOM SUCH THAT YOU'RE GOT MY CROBYOM CAN DO ITS JOB IN SUPPORTING YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM BUT HERE ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTECTS OF TO DAY'S DISCUSSION YOUR IM TUNE SYSTEM NOW THE LOW SUGAR COMPONENT OF LOW SUGAR FORMENTED FOODS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT IF YOU'RE CONSUMING YOGERTS WITH A LOT OF SUGAR OR YOU'RE CONSUMING CABUCCHO WITH HIGH LEVELS OF SUGAR OR YOUR CONSUMING PICKLES OR SOUR CRO THAT HAVE A LOT OF SUGAR IN THEM YOUR PROBABLY CAN A START TO CREATES SOME OTHER ISSUES RELATED TO THE SUGAR WHAT YOU'RE REALLY LOOKING FOR THESE LOW SUGAR FORMENTED FOODS ND THEY CAN BE A LITTLE BIT TRICKY DO SEEK OUT IN THE STORE BUT THEY'RE USUALLY THERE AND ONCE YOU IDENTIFY THE ONES THAT YOU LIKE YOU SHOULD REALLY AIM TO GET TWU TO FOUR SERVINGS OF THOSE PER DAY YOU CAN ALSO CONSUME A PREBIOTIC OR PROBOTIC IN THE FORM OF CAPSOL FORM THINGS LIKE EIGHT Y ONE ATHLETIC GREENS ALSO CONTAIN PREBIOTIC PROBIOTIC BUT IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT CONSUMING TWO TO FOUR SERVINGS OF LOW SUGAR FOMENTED FOODS PER DAY IS AMONG THE BEST WAYS TO PROMOTE HEALTH OF THE GOT MCROBIOM AND THAT THE GOT MICROBYOM IS SO SO IMPORTANT FOR T KEEPING THE INATE IMMUNE SYSTEM THRIVING SUCH THAT IT CAN COMBAT THE COLDS OR FLUES THAT ARE TRYING TO BOMBARD YOUR SYSTEM NOW THERE'S ANOTHER TOOL THAT YOU CAN USE TO ENHANCE YOUR GOT MICROBIOM I HAVE TO WARN YOU THI S ONE MIGHT MAKE A FEW OF YOU UM CRINGE A LITTL BIT BUT THIS IS ONE THAT I ACTUALLY STARTED DOING ABOUT FOUR MONTHS AGO UM IT'S A INTERESTING ONE IT OT IT DATES BACTICE OM OLDER COTENCO TRADITIONAL MEDICIN PRACTICES BUT IT MAKES REALLY GOOD LOGICAL SENSE TO BE FAIR I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY RENAMA'S CONTRAL TRIAL EXPLORING THE USE OF THIS PROTOCOL BUT IT'S SO SIMPLE AND COMPLETELY COST FREE AND IT STANDS SO STRONGLY ON THE LOGIC OF HOW THE GUT AND ORL MICROBIOM WORK THAT FRANKLY I STARTED DOING IT AND YOUKNOW WHETHER NOTS PLACIBO EFFECT OR NOT I DON'T KNOW BUT I FEEL BETTER AND IT'S SO EASY TO DO AND IT  STANDS TO POTENTIALLY IMPROVE THE FUNCTION OF YOUR GOT MICROBIOM ENOUGH THAT I FIGURE I WOULD AT LEAST SHARE IT WITH YOU AND THEN YOU CAN DECIDE SO WHAT THIS PROTOCAL ESSENTIALLY CONSISTS OF IS BEFORE YOU GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT OR IN THE MORNING YOU POUR YOURSELF A LITTLE BIT OF WATER WHATEVER WATER YOU HAPPEN TO CONSUME JUST CLEAN CLEAR WATER AND THEN YOU TAKE A SIP OF THAT WATER WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND YOU SWISH IT AROUND IN YOUR MOUTH AND THN YOU SWALLOW IT A THOSE OF YOU THER AE LIKE A GROSS LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS IS IT REALLY GROSS TO SWISH A LIW BIT OF WATER AROUND IN YOUR MOUTH AND THEN SWALLOW THAT WATER WHEN YOU FIRST WAKE UP PRIOR TO BRUSHIN YOUR TEETH OF COURSE WELL IT MIGHT SEEM GROSS TO YOU BUT THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT WHEN YOUR SLEEPING ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A NASAL BREATHER WHILE YOU SLEEP THE ENVIRONMENT WITHIN YOUR MOUTH IS SUCH THAT YOU'RE BREEDING A LOT OF BACTERIA YOU ARE CREATING ALL THOSE LITTLE MICROBACTERIA THAT POTENTIALLY CAN INHABIT YOURE DIGECTS OF TRACT AND PROVIDE AT LEAST SOME OF THE SUBSTRAT FOR THE MICROBIODA AND YOUR DIGESTIVE TRACT TO THRIVE AND IF THAT SEEMS GROSS YOU KEEP IN MIND THAT'S WHAT HAVING A HEALTHY GOT MICROBIOUM REALLY IS ALL ABOUT SO THE PROTOCALLS VERY SIMPLE AT ZERO COST YOU TAKE A SWIG OF WATER SWIRSH AROUND AND SWALLOW IT ODDLY IT DOESN'T TASTEBAD U IN FACT IT 'LL JUST TASTES LIKE SWALLOWING UM AND INFECTED TAKES LIKE SWALLOWING A LOW BIT OF WATER IT'S NOT AS IF IT TASTES LIKE AUM BAD BREATH OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT'S A VERY SIMPLE PROTOCAL THAT AGAIN NO RHENOMIZED CONTRAL TRIALS BUT REALLY STANDS ON THE LOGIC OF HOW THE ORAL MICROBUM IN THE GOT MICROBIUM INTERACT AND BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS SUPPORTING THE FUNCTION OF YOUR GOT MICROBIUM SUCH IT SUPPORTS THE FUNCTION OF YOUR NATE OMUNE SYSTEM SUCH THAT YOU CAN AVOID COLDS IN FLUES IT'S TO ME IT SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY LOW BAR YES O CAY SO TO BOLTURE URINATAMUNE SYSTEM YOU WANT TO GET THAT QUALITY SLEEP AS OFTEN AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN YOU WANT A SUPPORT THAT GOT MICROBIUM IN THE WAYS THAT WE JUST ASCRIBED WHAT ABOUT EXERCISE WE HEAR IT ALL THE TIME EXERCISE IS SO GOOD FOR US IT ENHANCES THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND ON AND ON UNLESS AN I'M A HUGE BELIEVER IN EXERCISE I PERSONALLY LIKE TO DO THREE BOUTS OF CARDIVASCULAR EXERCISE PER WEEK ONE LONG HON MEDIUM ONE SHORT AND I DO THREE BOUTS OF RESISTANCE TRAINING EACH WEEK ALL OF THAT AND SPECIFICALLY WHAT I DO IS AVAILABLE TO YOU AS A ZERO CROSS PROTOCAL IN THE FORM OF A PEDIF WE HAVE A LINK TO THAT IN THE SHOWNO CACTIONS I'LS HAVE A WHOLE EPISODE ABOUT FOUNDATIONAL FITNESS AND SO ON AND SO ON THE DISCUSSION WE'REGOIN TO HAVE NOW IS ABOUT WHAT GENERAL FORMS OF EXERCISE ACTUALLY DO SUPPORT THE INNATE EMMUNE SYSTEM AND AND THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT WHAT FORMS OF EXERCISE ACTUALLY DEPLETE OUR INNATE EMMUNE SYSTEM THIS ISNIT TALKED ABOUT ENOUGH I THINK THERE ARE CERTAIN INTENSITIES AND DURATIONS OF EXERCISE THAT MAKE US MORE VULNERABLE TO COLDSON FLES SO WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS THAT BEFORE WE DO THAT I WANT IT JUST BRIEFLY TOUCHING TO SOMETHING THAT I HEAR A LOT WHICH IS THE QUESTION IF IU'MFEELING A LITLEBIT RUN DOWN SHOULD I EXERCISE OR NOT AND TO BE ONEST THERE ISN'T A STRAIGHT FOR TO ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME OR FOR YOU TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT YOU WERE INDEED EXPOSED TO A COLDER FLUE AND YOU'RE STARTING TO COMBATED AT THE LEVEL OF YOUR NATEMUNE SYSTEM WHERE WEATHER NOT YOU'RE JUST OW FEELING A LOBIT SLUGGISH HOWEVER WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT IF YOU ARE FEELING MALAZE AT THE LEVEL OF THE BODY LIKE YOUR BODY IS FEELING DIFFERENT IT'S FEELING HEAVIER YOUR FEELING TIRED YOU FEELING TIRED AT A TIME OF DAY THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE GIVING YOUR USUAL PATTERNS O BEING TIRED YOU'RE FEELING TIRED IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE GIVEN HOW MUCH SLEEP YOU GOT THE NIGHT BEFORE RI T I MAN HEAR WHAT WERE TALKING ABOUT IS RULING OUT ANY POSSIBLE IN A LIFE STRESSOR YOU'RE UP TOO LADE OR YOU DRANK CAFFIN AT THE WRONG TIME OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHAT WE KNOWS THAT YOU'RE IF YOU'RE FEELING THAT GENERAL MALAYIS ACROSS YOUR WHOLE BODY IT IS FAIRLY LIKELY THAT YOU'R COMING DOWN WITH SOMETHING AND THAT YOU'R BEST RESPONSE TO THAT WOULD BE TO GO HOME TAKE A HOT SHOWER BATH I'LL EXPLAIN WHY YOUWOULD WANT TO DO THAT IN A FEW MINUTES AND THEN GET INTO BED EARLY AND EVEN IF YOU CAN'T FALL ASLEEP TO JUST BE AS STILL AND AS RELAXED AS POSSIBLE WE KNOW THAT IF YOU PUSH INTO BOUTS OF INTENSE ACTIVITY OR EVEN JUST PUSH YOURSELF TO ENGAGE IN ACTIVITY WHEN YOU'R FEELING RUN DOWN AT THAT SOR WHOLE BODY LEVEL MAY BE A LITTLE TICKLING YOUR THROAT YOU ARE GOING TO COMPROMISE THE FUNCTION OF YOUR INEITE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET MORE SICK THAN YOU WOULD OTHERWISE TUS SO HERE'S MY SUGGESTION IF YOU'RE STRYING TO FEEL RUN DOWN AT THE LEVEL WHOLE BODY MALAYS OR YOU JUST DON'T FEEL RIGHT YOU'RE BEST OFF TAKING A HOT SHOWER BATH AND GETTING INTO BED ORGES GETTING INTO BED AND TRYING TO REST AND GET AS MUCH SLEEP PROBABLY EVEN A LABIT OF EXTRA SLEEP AND HERE'S WHY THAT WHOLE BODY MALAYS THAT EXTRA FATIGUE THAT'S NOT EASILY EXPLAINED BY OTHER FACTORS IN YOUR LIFE HAVE TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT WHEN YOU'RE INATE IMUNE SYSTEM IS ACTIVATED MEANING IT'S ALREADY COMBATING AR COLD OR FLE INTERLUKAN ONE AND INTERLUCAN SIX HAVE A WAY OF INTERACTING WITH A PARTICULAR BRAIN AREA CALLED THE DORSAL RAFET NUCLEUS LWHICH IS CHOCK A BLOCK FULL OF NURONS THAT RELEASE SERATONIN AND SERATONIN FROM THE DORSA RAFET NUCLEUS ACTS ON SPECIFIC REGIONS OF YOUR HYPOTHALMAS ERE IS LIKE THE PREOPTIC REGION FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT WANT TO KNOW AND OTHER AIRS OF THE HYPOTHALMAS THAT GENERATE A STATE OF SLEEPINESS IN ADDITION WHEN WE ARE GETTING SICK OUR SLEEP PATTERNS CHANGE WE FEEL LIKE WE NEED TO SLEEP MORE BUT WE DON'T FEEL AS RESTED FROM THAT SLEEP AND THT HAS TO DO WIT THE WAYS THAT SERATONAN INTERACTS WITH SOME OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE BRAIN CIRCUITORY INVOLVED IN SLEEP THAT CONTROLS SLOW WAVE OR DEEP SLEEP AND THIS IS A WHOLE DISCUSSION UNTO ITSELF ACTUALLY COVERED A LOT OF THE MECHANISTIC ASPECTS OF THIS BUSINESS OF IMMUNE INDUCED SLEEPINESS AND MALAYS ASSOCIATED WITH FEELING SICK AND AN EPISODE ABOUT INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE NURLE AND AMMUNE SYSTEM THAT I WILL ALSO PROVIDE A LINK TO IN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS BUT SUFFICE TO SAY IF YOU'RE FEELING THAT WHOLE BODY MALAYS AND ESPECIALY IF YOU ALL S HAVE A LOVE IT OF A THROAT TICKLING JUST NOT FEELING RIGHT FOR YOU YOU'RE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO FEELING THAT WAY AT THAT TIME OF DAY OR NIGHT WELL THEN I ENCOURAGE YOU TO GET REST BECAUSE CHANCES ARE T YOU'R ALREADY COMBATING AND INFECTION HOWEVER IF YOU ARE OUT AN ABOUT A LOT DURING THE WINTER MONTHS OR YOU'R INTERACTING WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE BY VIRTUE OF WORK OR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION OR WHATEVER THE GEM ET CETERA YOUR SCHOOL TEACHER MAYE YOUR KIDS ARE COMING HOME WITH COLDS AND FLES AND YOU'RE NOT YET FEELING THAT MALAYS YOU'RE NOT FEELING ANY THROAT TICKLE YOU'RE NOT GETTING THAT KIND OF ON  AND A BURNING ORE TICKLE WITHIN YOUR NAZAL PASSAGES WHEN YOU BREATHE YON WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THESE THINGS THAT WATERING THE EYES THAT KIND OF PRECEDS THE GETTING THE FULE BLOWN COLD OR FLE WELL IF YOURE NOT EXPERIENCING THAT STUFF AND YOU WANT A KEEP YOUR INATEMUNE SYSTEM STRONG ENABLE TO COMBAT OFF COLDS IN FLUES THEN WE KNOW THAT EXERCISE CAN BE AN EXCELLENT WAY TO INCREASE THE OUTPUT OF THAT INNATE IMUNE SYSTEM WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THE APPROPRIATE INTENSITY IN DURATION OF EXERCISE CAN ACT AS A STRESSER THAT PROMOTES A BIT OF INFLAMMATION YES THE RELEASE OF CIHTA KINDS AND A BIT OF ACTIVATION OF THE INATOMUNE SYSTEM INCLUDING THE PRODUCTION OF MORE WHITE BLOOD SELLS NATURAL KILLER CELLS SUCH THAT YOURE SORT OF PROMPTING THE INAT AMUNE SYSTEM TO ALMOST THINK THAT THERE'S SOMETHING TO BATTLE SUCH THAT IF YOU EVER ENCOUNTER IN INFECTION YOU CAN DEFEAT IT RIGHT OFF THE BAT SO WE'EGOIN TO GET GRANULAR HERE ABOUT WHAT WE MEAN BY PROPER INTENSITY AN DURATION OF EXERCISE THERE'S A WONDERFUL REVIEW THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN TWENTY NINETEEN IN THE JOURNAL OF SPORT AND HEALTH SCIENCE ENTITLED THE COMPELLING LINK BETWEEN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND THE BODIES DEFENSE SYSTEM AND THERE'S A LOT TO THIS REVIEW ARTICAL BUT OUF JUST THE HIGH LIGHT A FEW OF THE CRITICAL FEATURES THAT ARE GOING TO DIRECTLY RELATE TO PROTOCALS THAT I THINK ALL OF YOU ARE GOING TO BE INTERESTED IN FIRST OF ALL WE KNOW THAT EXERCISE THAT'S OF SIXTY MINUTES INDURATION OR LESS AND THAT IS INTENSE BUT NOT ALL OUT EFFORT  HERE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT PERCENTAGE OF SINGLE REPETITION MAX WEIGHT HERE WERE NOT TALKING ABOUT SEVEN NEED TO EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF ONE'S VIO TWO MAX WHAT WERE TALKING ABOUT IS YOU SUBJECTIVELY GAUGING WHAT IS A TEN OUT OF TEN EFFORT LAKE YOU COULD NOT DO ANY MORE YOU COULD NOT CONTRIBUTE ANY MORE EFFORT TO THAT EXERCISE BOUT AND THAT'S TROUGH WHETHER NOT WHERE TIME ABOUT RESISTANCE TRAINING EXERCISE OR PARTY OF ASCULAR EXERCISE LIKE RUNNING OR ROWING OR THINGS OF THAT SORT WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT IF YOU DO THAT SORT OF EXERCISE FOR ABOUT SIXTY MINUTES OR LESS YOU PROMOTE THE EXCHANGE OF COMPONENTS BETWEEN THE BLOOD AND THE LEMPHATIC SYSTEM THAT INCREASE THE CIRCULATION OF THOSE CELLS AND CHEMICALS WITHIN THE INATEMUNE SYSTEM SUCH THAT NOT JUST DURING EXERCISE BUT FOR MANY MANY HOURS AFTERWARDS MAY BE EVEN AS MUCH AS TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTERWARDS YOUR INATE EMUNE SYSTEM LEVEL A BASELINE ACTIVITY IS RAMPED UP ALLOWING YOU TO BETTER COMBAT INFECTIONS SUCH AS COLDS AND FLUES O CASE TO THIS IS AN INCENTIVE FOR GETTING REGULAR EXERCISE OF SIXTY MINUTES OR LESS PER DAY MAKING IT OF SUFFICIENT INTENSITY FOR YOUR INATEMUNE SYSTEM TO DEPLOY MORE OF THOSE CHEMICALS AND FOR YOUR LEMPHATIC AN BLOOD CIRCULATION TO INCREASE THEIR EXCHANGE OF MATERIALS ENOUGH THAT YOUR NATEMUNE SYSTEM IS BOLSTERED HOWEVER IT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT THE CASE THAT MORE IS BETTER IN FACT IT'S PROBABLY THE CASE THAT LESS IS BETTER HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW FOR SURE AND THIS REVIEU COVER SORT OF THE EXTREME OF THESE EXAMPLES BUT FOR INSTANCE PEOPLE THAT DO BOUTS OF WALKING EACH DAY FOR ABOUT SIXTY MINUTES BRISK WALKING EXPERIETES INCREASE TECELL FUNCTION SO THAT'S AN A MUNE CELL THAT GOES OUT IN COMBATS COLD IN FLUVE IRASES AND NATURAL KILLER CELL ACTIVITY SO THOSE INCREASE INCREASE MACRIPHAGE FUNCTION YOU ARE NOW FAMILIAR WITH THESE CELLS IF YOU DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY DO JUST KEEP IN MIND THAT YOUR HART ABOUT THESE IN THE CONTEX OF WHAT THE IINNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM DOES TO GO OUT AND FIGHT COLDS IN FLUES CYTIKINDS INCREASE BUT NOT DRAMATICALLY O CASE TO THIS IS A MILD INFLAMMATION RESPONSE STRESS HORMONE SUCH AS CUARTERS ALL APPENEFGFR NOR UPAN EFRAND ALSO CALLED ADRENOLINE AND NORA DRENLINE THOSE ARE DEPLOYED IS WELL SO SIXTY MINUTES OR LESS OF THIS MODERATE TO HIGH INTENSITY EXERCISE CREATES THIS MILD STRESS OF SPONSE AND IN INCREASE IN THE FUNCTION OF THE INNATE AMUE SYSTEM HOWEVER PEOPLE THAT RUN A MARYTHON AND AS I RECALL A MARYTHON IS TWENTY SIX POINT TWO MILES IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN THEY EXPERIENTS A VERY DIFFERENT PATTERN OF IMMUNE RESPONSE TO THAT LONG BOWED OF EXERCISE SO HERE WE'RE COMPARING ONE HOUR OF EXERCISE TO THREE HOURS IS HAT WHAT IT TAKES TO RUN AMARYTHON HAVE SOME FRIENDS THEIR MARYTHONERS I'M TO SEEN ABOUT THREE MAY BE FOUR HOURS IF YOURE REALLY SLOW BUT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN YOU KNOW INO TWO AND A HALF AND THREE HOURS OF YOUR TRAINED UP AND YOU'RE DOING IT YOU'RE DOING THEM REGULARLY WELL HERE'S THE POINT PEOPLE WHO JUSS RAN AMARYTHON AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN TRAINING FOR A MARYTHON AND ARE APPROACHING THAT MARYTHON ARE SEVERELY IMMUNE COMPROMISE THE LEVELS OF THEIR TCELL FUNCTION ARE WAY BELOW BASELONE MEANING THER ANATE TO MUNE SYSTEM IS NOT FUNCTIONING NEARLY AS WELL AS IT WOULD IF THEY WERE TO NOT EXERCISE AT ALL THEIR NATURAL KILLER SELL ACTIVITY IS ALSO GREATLY DIMINISHED THESE ARE HUGE HUGE REDUCTIONS IN THESE CELLS THAT IS IN THE FUNCTION THE INNATE IMUNE SYSTEM AND THEIR STRESS HORMONES AND THEIRE INFLAMMATORY MOLECULES SUCH AS SIDA KON CIRCULATING IN THEIR BLOOD ARE EXTREMELY HIGH NOW AGAIN WE'RE REPRESENTING OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE SPECTRUM HERE WITH ONE HOUR OR LESS OF EXERCISE DAILY VERSES TWENTY SIX POINT TWO MILE MARYTHON EXERCISE OR HALF MARYTHONS AS THE CASE MAY BE AND LET ME BE VERY DIRECT I'M NOT DISCOURAGING PEOPLE FROM RUNNING OR TRAINING FOR MARTHONS OR HALF MARATHONS I THINK THAT'S CREATE JUST UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO YOUR MUNE SYSTEM WHEN YOU DO THAT AND TAKE THE NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS BUT I THINK MOST PEOPLE LISTENING TO THIS ARE TRYING TO THINK ABOUT WAYS THAT THEY CAN AVOID GETTING COLDS IN FLUES AND CERTAINLY RUNNING MARATHONS IS NOT GOING TO BE THE WAY TO DO THAT QUITE THE CONTRARY THE WAY TO DO THAT IS IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER THINGS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TO GET REGULAR EXERCISE MAY BE NOT EVERY SINGLE DAY I'M ACTUALY A FAN OF TAKING ONE DAT PER WEEK COMPLETELY OFF FROM EXERCISE YOU SHOULD ON THAT DAY I'LL DO SOME SON AN COLD IF I HAVE IT AVAILABLE TO ME BUT THE POINT IS THIS YOU DON'T HAVE TO EXERCISE FOR AN HOUR A DAY IN ORDER TO GET THIS IMPROVEMENT IN THE INNATE AMUNE RESPONSE DATA SHOW THAT YOU CAN GET THIS IMPROVEMENT IN INNATE AMUNE RESPONSE WITH AS LITTLE AS TWENTY MINUTES PER DAY AND PROBABLY EVEN AS LITTLE AS TWELVE MINUTES PER DAY HOWEVER IF YOU'RE GOING TO TRY AND ACCOMPLISH THIS INCREASE IN THE INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION OR OUTPUT WITH HA SHORTER BOWD OF EXERCISE SUCH AS TWELVE MINUTES IT BETTER BE TWELVE MINUTES OF VERY HIGH INTENSITY TRAINING IN FACT THAT'S WHAT LANDS ON MY OT FOR ME IT'S FRIDAY BUT IT IS A REALY MATTER WHICH DAY THE WEEK THEREIS ONE DAY OF THE WEEK WHERE I DO A VERY SHORT BOUT OF CARTY OF ASCULAR EXERCISE BUT I'M SPRINTING HARD FOR ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY SECONDS TO A MINUTE AD THAN I'M TAKING A BRIEF PERIOD OF REST IN THE REPEATING THAT FOR A TOTAL OF TWELVE MINUTES NOW SOME PEOPLE HERE OH ONLY TWELVE MINUTES OF EXERCISE REQUIRED AND THEY DEFAUL TO TWELVE MINUTES EVERY SINGLE TIME THEY TRAIN I DON'T THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA I THINK THAT WE CAN TAKE THE LAW OF AVERAGES HERE AND SAY THE FOLLOWING I DO BELIEVE EVERY ONE SHOULD DO A COMMINATION OF CARTY OF ASCULAR TRAINING AND RESISTANCE TRAINING PERHAPS I THINK IN GENERAL NOT ON THE SAME DAYS BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT AND YOU WANT TO MAINTAIN HEALTHY MUN SYSTEM FUNCTION MY SUGGESTION WHEN I DO IS UNLESS IT'S THE LONG BOWED OF CARTY OF ASCULAR TRAINING THAT DO ONCE A WEEK AND LONG FOR ME MEAN SIXTY TO NINETY MINUTES AND SOMETIMES LONGER IF IT'S A HEIGHT WHICH CERTAINLY DOESN'T REQUIRE THAT MUCH INTENSITY I SUGGEST WARMING UP FOR ABOUT FIVE TO TEN MINUTES AND THEN LIMITING YOUR TOTAL WORK OUT DURATION TO ABOUT FIFTY MINUTES MAYBE SIXTY MINUTES IF THAT'S WHAT'S REQUIRED TO COMPLETE WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO KEEP WITH YOUR EXERCISE GOALS BUT TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT EXCEEDING SEVENTY FIVE MINUTES OF EXERCISE IN ANY ONE SINGLE EXERCISE ABOUT ANDIF YOU REMEMBER BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE WHEN I SAID THAT I TRACK WHAT I DO ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS AND I DON'T DO IT IN A VERY DETAILED WAY BUT I DO TAKE NOTE OF WHEN I'VE GOT IN A BAD FLUEER COLD I CAN TELL YOU THAT IN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE CASE WHERE I'VE GOT IN A BAD FLUER COLD THERARE TWO THINGS THAT HAVE PRECEEDED THAT BAD FLUER COLD ONE IS SLEEP DEPROVATION TYPICALLY IT WOULD BE NIGHTS WHERE I GOT TWO HOURS OF SLEEP OR LESS FOR MORE THAN ONE NIGHT OCAY THE SECOND THING IS ANY TIME THAT I REALLY PUSHED IT WITH EXERCISE AND WHEN ALL OUT AND I WENT FOR SEVENTY FIVE MINUTES AND THEN I CONTINUE TO NINETY MINUTES AND THEN MAY BE LATER THAT DAY BECAUSE SOMEBODY INVITED ME ON A RUN OR SOMETHNG LIKE THAT I ALSO DID THAT SECOND RUN OR THAT SECOND WORK OUT OF SOME KIND COULD BE RUNNING IN THE MORNING AN WAIT TRAINING IN THE AFTERNOON SOME PEOPLE CAN DO THAT KIND OF TRAINING ON A REGULAR BASIS EVEN AND NOT GET SICK I AM NOT SUCH A PERSON I'VE MANAGE TO MAINTAIN FAIRLY CONSISTENT FITNESS OUTPUT MEANING THE THREE CARTY OF ASCULAR IN THE THREE WAIT TRAINING SESSIONS PER WEEK FOR MORE THAN SEVERAL DECADES NOW AND PART OF THE REASON I THINK I'VE BE ABLE TO DO THAT IS BECAUSE I DON'T EVER PUSH TOO HARD FOR TOO LONG WITHIN A GIVEN WORK OUT SO THIS IS REALLY A CALL FOR MODERATION INTERMS OF THE DURATION AND INTENSITY OF THE EXERCISE THAT YOU'RE DOING BUT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT REALLY BEING LAID BACK WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT EASY WORK OUTS WHAT WERE TALKING ABOUT IS AN HOUR OR LESS OF MODERATE INTENSITY TO HIGH INTENSITY EXERCISE DEPENDING ON THE DURATION OF THAT EXERCISE AND KEEPING IN MIND THAT WHEN YOU'RE DOING THAT YOU ARE ACTIVATING THAT INATE IMMUNE SYSTEM YOU'RE LITERALLY CREATING AN IMMUNEROUS SPONSE YOU'R INCREASING INFLAMMATION YOUR INCREASING THOSE SIDA KINDS YOU'R INCREASING STRESS HORMONES WE HAVE TO START TO THINK ABOUT EXERCISE FOR WHAT IT IS WHICH IS A FORM OF STRESS THAT INDUCES ADAPTATIONS DOCTRANY GALLP AND TALKED A LOT ABOUT THIS IN THE SERIES THAT HE DID ON EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY ITS A EXCELLENT SERIES AT COVERS EVERYTHING FROM STRENGTH TO HYPERTROPHEE TO SPEED TO ENDURANCE NUTRICIAN SUPPLEMENTATION CAN FIND ALL THAT AT HUVRM LAVEDOT CALM VERY EASILY EXERCISE IS A VERY POTENT TOOL WE KNOW THAT WE KNOW THAT IN THE CONTECT OF CHANGING ASTETICS LIKE BODY MASS COMPOSITION YOU INCREASING MUSCLE REDUCING FACT WE KNOW THAT IN THE CONTECTS OF REDUCING RESTING HEART RATE REDUCING RESTIN BLOOD PRESSURE WE KNOW THAT IN THE CONTECTS OF ALL THESE OTHER HEALTH METRICS HERE WERE TALKING ABOUT USING EXERCISE AS A VERY POTENT TOOL TO INCREASE THE FUNCTION OF THE NAE OMUNE SYSTEM TO KEEP YOU HEALTHY NOT JUST THOUGH THE WINTER MONTHS BUT AROUND THE YEAR AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE GETTING LESS SLEEP IF YOURE INTERACTING WITH KIDS OR ADULTS THAT OURE CARRYING INFECTIONS HOME FROM SCHOOL OR WORK ON A REGULAR BASIS OR MAY BE EVEN WORKIN AN ENVIRONMENTS LIKE A HOSPITAL OR CLINIC WHERE YOUR REGULARLY INTERACTING WITH PATIENTS THAT HAVE THESE ISSUES ONE THING THAT I OFTEN GET ASKED IS IF I AM SLEEP DEPRIVED SHOULD I EXERCISE ND THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A TRICKY ONE MY INITIAL RESPONSE FOR MANY YEARS WAS NO NOW IF YOUR SLEEP DEPRISED YOU'R BETTER OFF NOT EXERCISING HOWEVER I NOW NEED TO QUALIFY THAT ANSWER BECAUSE THEIR DATA SHOWING THAT IF YOU'R SLEEP DEPRISED AND YOU EXERCISE ESPECIALLIF YOU EXERCISE EARLY IN THE DAY AND IT DOESN'T DESTRUPT YOUR SLEEP SCHETULE SO IT'S NOT MAKING YOU GO TO SLEEP EVEN LATER THE NEXT NIGHT THAT IT ACTUALLY CAN CAUSE SOME ADJUSTMENTS IN THE FUNCTION OF YOUR IMUNE SYSTEM AND IN THE WAY THAT YOU REGULATE YOUR BLOOD SUGAR THAT OFFSET SOME OF THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF SLEEP DEPROBATION THAT SAID YOU SHOULD NEVER EVER COMPROMISE THE AMOUNT OF SLEEP YOU COULD GET IN ORDER TO GET EXERCISE SUCH THAT YOU RUN YOURSELF DOWN SO WHAT I'M REALLY SAYING HERE AS IF YOU GET ONE BAD NIGHT SLEEP SHOULD YOU SKIP YOUR WORK OUT AND YOU FEEL LIKE I U NOW I'M NOT FEELING SICK AND I SHOULD I WORK OUT OR SHOULD I I GO BACK TO SLEEP PROBABLY GOING BACK TO SLEEPS THE BETTER IDEA BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE OPTION TO GO BACK TO SLEEP FOR WHATEVER REASON YOU CAN'T FALL BACK TO SLEEP THAN YOU WOULD BE WISE TO DO ABOUT OF EXERCISE BUT I WOULD SUGGESTS REDUCING THE INTENSITY AND DURATION OF THAT EXERCISE BY ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT MAY BE EVEN FIFTY PERCENT AND THAT SHOULD ALLOW YOU TO OFFSET ANY OF THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF SLEEP DEPPROBATION FOR THAT ONE NIGHT KEEP IN MIND EXERCISE IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR SLEEP AND THEN TO ALLOW YOU TO GET TO SLEEP AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME LATER THAT NIGHT AND BACK ON YOUR REGULAR SCADUAL KEEPING YOUR NEIGHT IMUN SYSTEM TUNED UP AND READY TO COMBAT ANY COLDS OR FLUCE NOW ONE MORE POINT ABOUT EXERCISE AND HERE WERE ALSO GOING TO DOVE TAIL IN AND IMPORTANT POINT ABOUT NEUTRITION IN THE REVIEW THAT I MENTIONED A FEW MOMENTS AGO THEY COVER SOME OF THE DATA FROM STUDIES EXPLORING THE POST EXERCISE STRESS RESPONSE SO THIS IS THE POST EXERCISE INDUCED INCREASE IN THINGS LIKE CORTIS ALL THOSE NATURAL KILLERCELLS THE PRODUCTION A WHITE BLOOD CELLS AND SO ON IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT IF YOU ARE IN A STATE OF CHRONIC STRESS BECAUSE YOUR EXERCISING A LOT AND OOR BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT SLEEPING ENOUGH OR FOR WHATEVER REASON MAY BE YOU HVE A LOT OF LIFES STRESS IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT IN JESTING C ARBOHYDRATES AFTER EXERCISE CAN HELP ATTENUATE SOME OF THE INFLAMMATION THAT EXERCISE IN DUCES WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CARBOHYDRATES WERE TALKING ABOUT RICE OATMEAL POSSES THOSE SORTS OF THINGS SO CALL COMPLEX CARBOHYDRATES AND FRUIT POST EXERCISE HAS BEN SHOWN TO A TENUATE TO REDUCE SOME OF THE MARKERS OF INFLAMMATION BY ABOUT THIRTY TO FORTY PER CENT WHEN CONTRASTED WITH WATER ONLY IN TAKE ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE TRAINING FASTED SO FOR THOSE OF YOU LIKE ME THAT LIKE TO WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND JUST DRINK FLUIDS YOU KNOW FOR ME ITS WATER YOUR BAMATE COFFEE AND BY THE WAY I'VE SAID BEFORE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD DELAY THEIR CAFINE AND TAKE NINETY MINUTES IF AN ONLY IF THEIR EXPERIENCING IN AFTERNOON CRASH BUT THAT IF YOU ARE EXERCISEING FIRSTHING IN THE MORNING IT'S PERFECTLY FINE TO INGEST YOUR CAFINE RIGHT AWAY SO THAT GIVES YOU A INCREASE IN ENERGY FOR THAT EXERCISE THAT CERTAINLY WOULD I DO ON DAYS THE DI EXERCISE BUT IF YOU FAST AND THEN YOU'RE DRINKING KAFFINE AND THEN YOU'RE EXERCISING AND THAT EXERCISE GOES LONGER THAN SIXTY MINUTES CERTAINLY IF IT GOES LONGER THAN SEVENTY FIVE MINUTES YOU WOULD DO WELL TO INJEST SOME COMPLEX CARBOHYDRATES MAY BE ALSO SOME FRUIT PERHAPS NOT IMMEDIATELY AFTER EXERCISE BUT WITHIN THE FORTY FIVE MINUTES ORE SO OR HOUR OR SO AFTER EXERCISE SO THAT YOUARE NOT RAMPING UP THOSE INFLAMMATORY MOLECULES AND LEAVING THEM RAMPED UP FOR MANY HOURS INTO THE MORNING ANDTHROUGHOUT THE DAY BECAUSE OF COURSE THIS EPISODE IS NOT ABOUT EXERCISE IN NUTRITION BUT HERE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE ROLL THAT EXERCISE IN NUTRITION PLAY IN HELPING US COMBAT COLDS IN FLUES BY INCREASING THE FUNCTION OF THAT INATE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND THE REASONS WHY CARBOHYDRATES CAN HAVE THIS EFFECT ON CORTISALL AT CETERAAS AN INTERESTING IN IMPORTANT DISCUSSION INTO ITSELF WILL LEVE IT FOR ANOTHER EPISODE BUT KEEP THAT MIND ALSO ION ABOUT YOU BUT A NICE BULL OF OTMEAL SOME FRUIT AND A PROTINE DRINK OR SOME EGGS AFTER AN HOUR OR SO OF EXERCISE IN THE MORNING WHEN I HAVEN'T EATEN ANYTHING SINCE THE NIGHT BEFORE TASTES REALLY REALLY GOOD SO CONTINUING WITH THE THEME OF THINGS THAT WE CAN DO AT THE LEVEL OF BEHAVIORS TO IMPROVE THE FUNCTION OF OUR INATE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND COMBAT COLDS IN FLUES PERHAPS EVEN PREVENT US FROM GETTING COLDS IN FLUES AT ALL BUT CERTAINLY HELP COMBAT THEM IF THEY'V INITIALLY MADE THEIR WAY INTO OUR SYSTEM BUT WE HAVEN'T DEVELOPE FULL BLOWN SYMPTOMS AND WE WANT TO PREVENT THOSE FULL BLOWN SYMPTOMS IS THE USE OF DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE IN PARTICULAR SANA IS A NICE STUDY ON THIS THAT WAS PUBLISHED VERY RECENTLY TWENTY TWENTY THREE THE TITLE OF THE STUDY IS THE EFFECTS OF A SINGLE AND SERIES OF FINISH SANA SESSIONS ON THE IMMUNE SYSTEM RESPONDSE AND HEAT SHOCK PROTINE SEVENTY LEVELS AND TRAINED AND UNTRAINED MEN IT'S A VERY INTERESTING STUDY THEY COMPARED ATHLETICALLY TRAINED AND NON ATHLETICALLY TRAINED MEN AS MOST OF YOU PROBABLY KNOW WHEN YOU GET INTO A HOT SANA HARTRATE INCREASES THERE'S FASE OF DILATION THERE'S THE INCREASE IN THE RELEASE OF HEAT SHOCK PROTEINES THERESTY INCREASIN THINGS LIKE DINORPHAN WHICH IF ITS SUFFICIENTLY HOT ARE INCREASED TO LEVELS THAT MAKE US FEEL KIND OF AGITATED AND NOT SO GOOD WE HAVE TO ACTIVELY CALM OURSELVES IN THE SANAS O ERE NOT TINKE ABOUT AN EASY CRUISE AT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DEGREES FERENHEIT WERE TALKING BY GETTING UP IN TO THE YOU A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DEGREE FERENHEITE OR TWO HUNDRED TEN DEGREE FARENHEIT RANGE MAYBE VEN HIRE IF YOU'RE A HEAT ADAPTED AND TH T THE DINORPHAN MAKES YOU FEEL LOUSY IN THE SHORT TERM BUT THAT UPREGULATES A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS THAT GIVE YOU KIND OF LOW LEVEL UPHORIA AND ACTUALLY THE CAPACITY TO EXPERIENCE MORE FEELINGS OF WELL BEING FROM THE ENDORPHANS THAT YOU MAKE AFTER YOU GET OUT OF THE SANA THIS IS O SO IMPORTANT T UNDERSTAND WHETHER NOT WERE TING BY EXERCISE OR DELIBERATE COALD EXPOSUR DELIBERATE HEAT EXPOSURE WHAT HAPPENS JURING THE HEAT EXPOSURE COLD EXPOSURE OR EXERCISE IS MORE OFTEN THAN NOT JUST THE TRIGGER FORD THE LONG TERMADAPTATION THAT WERE SEEKING JUST LIKE EXERCISE INCREASES YOUR HEART RATE AND BLOOD PRESSUR BUT THEN LEADS TO REDUCTIONS IN RESTING HEART RATE IND BLOOD PRESSURE AND SO ON AND SO FORTH THIS STUDY IS INTERESTING IN THEIRE LOT OF DIFFERENT TAKE AWAYS FROM THE STUDY BECAUSE THEY COMPARED THESE TWO DIFFERENT POPULATIONS I' JUST GIVE YOU THE TOP CONTOURE OF WHAT THE PROTOCALL ENTAILED THERE WERE TEN SANASESSIONS EACH OF THOSE SANA SESSIONS WERE THREE ROUNDS OF FIFTEEN MINUTES OF SANA SO ONE SESSION MEANT GOING INTO THE SANA THE SANA WAS OF WU GIVEN TEMPERATURE BUT I THINK FOR MOST PEOPLE WHAT SCAN O WORK IN TERMS OF WHAT PARALLELS TO STUDY IS GOING TO BE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN A HUNDERE AND SEVENTY SIX AND TWO HUNDR AND TEN DEGREES FERENHEITE DEPENDING ON HOW HEAT ADAPTED YOU ARE ALWAYS BE SAFEH DON'T DO THIS IF YOURE PREGNANT O THIS IF YOU'RE A CHILD ET CETERA SO THERE DURING THREE ROUNDS OF FIFTEEN MINUTES EACH SEPARATED BY TWO MINUTES DURING THAT TWO MINUTES THEY TAKE A COOL SHOWER WITH A COOL OFF IN SOME WAY THEY'RE NOT GOING INTO A COAL PLUNGE BUT THE COOLING OFF WITH A COOL SHOWER AND THERE DURING THAT THREE TIMES THAT'S ONE SESSION THEY DO TEN SESSIONS THOSE SANA SESSIONS WERE SPACED APART BY AT LEAST A FEW DAYS AND THE ENTIRE EXPERIMENT MEANING ALL TEN SESSIONS WERE COMPLETED WITHIN A THREE WEEK PERIOD AND THEN A BUNCH OF THINGS WERE MEASURED LIKE THE AMOUNT OF WHITE BLOOD CELLS AND IMMUNE CELLS THAT WERE DEPLOYED AFTER THE FIRST SESSION VERSES THE THIRD VERSES THE EIGHTH VERSES THE TENTH AND SO ON AS WELL AS THE LEVELS OF CORTISALL AND INFLAMMATORY MARKERS ARE LOTOF I THINGS MEASURED IN THE STUDY HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW SANABAT SAYS THEIRE CALLING THEM RESULTED IN TA STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IND CORTISALL CONCENTRATION AFTER THE FIRST END THE TENTH SANA SESSION O CASO EVERY TIME YOU GO INTO THE SANA YOU'RE GETTING IN INCREASE IN CORTIS ALL WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE THE HEAT IS A STRESSER AGAIN DON'T THINK ABOUT HEAT AS TH OL YOU JUST CON RELAXING IN THE SAN AND SO NICE YOU'RE GETTING A CORTISALL RESPONSE CORTISALL IS A LUCOCORTICOID STRESS HORMONAS IT SOMETIMES CALLED WHICH CAN BE A GOOD THING IF IT SETS IN MOTION A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS SUCH AS THE INCREASE IN THE ACTIVITY THE ANATEMIUN SYSTEM AND INDEED THAT IS WHAT THEY OBSERVED AFTER AND HERE ON PARAPHRASING AFTER THE FIRST AND TENTH SAN A BATHS THEY WITNESSED AN INCREASE IN LUCASITE COUNT LUCASITES ARE A PARTICULAR TYPE OF CELL OF THE ANANEMIUN SYSTEM HOWEVER ONLY AFTER THE LAST SAN A SESSION DID THIS CHANGE REACH STATISTICAL SIGNI AGAINS IN THE TRAINED GROUP SO WHAT THEY OBSERVED WAS THAT ATHLETES WHO ARE TRAINED ARE USED TO BEING IN HIGH HEAT CONDITIONS BECAUSE OF THEIR ATHLETIC TRAINING PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT TRAINED IN ATHLETICS ARE NOT USE TO THAT THERE'RE A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO LOOK AT THESE DATA BUT THE SIMPLEST TAKE AWAY IS THAT IF YOU ARE ALREADY VERY HEAT ADAPTIT BECAUSE YOU DO SANA REGULARLY OR YOU EXERCISE REGULARLY WELL THEN IT'S GOING TO TAKE A STRONGER STIMULUS OR MORE SANA EITHER LONGER OR HOTTER OR MORE FREQUENT TO GET THE SORTS OF INCREASES IN INNATE IMMUNE RESPONSE AS COMPARED TO SOME ONE WHOSE NEVER DONE SANA WHOSE NOT EXERCISING REGULARLY AND THAT JUST MAKE SENSE IF SOMETHING ISN'T STRESSFUL TO YOU YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE STIMULATION OF THAT INNATE AMUNE RESPONSE AND THE OVER ALL TAKE AWAY FROM THIS STUDY WAS THAT I DO BELIEVE THAT IF YOU'RE FEELING RUN DOWN A LITTLE BIT OR IF YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO KEEP COLDS IN FLUES HAT BAY HAVING SOME REGULAR ISH PRACTICE OF GETTING INTO THE SANA FOR THREE ROUNDS OF FIFTEEN MINUTES SEPARATE BY TWO MINUTE COOL OFF YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO DO A COLD SHOWER OR COLD PLUNGE IN BETWEEN ALTHOUGH I DON'T SEE WHY YOU COULDN'T OR WOULDN'T BEU COULD ALSO JUST GET OUT THE SANAN BE IN THE COOL AIR AND THEN GET BACK IN OR PERHAPS YOU DO SOMETHING MORE AKIN TO WHAT'S BEEN SHOWN INOTHER STUDIES THAT EXPLORE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HEAT EXPOSURE AN IMMUN RESPONSE WHICH IS TO DO TWO ROUNDS OF TWENTY MINUTES OR ONE ROUND OF THIRTY MINUTES THAN THE SANA WHATEVER YOU CAN DO SAFELY AND COMFORTABLY KEEP IN MIND SAFETYAS KEYOU DON'T HARM YOURSELF I SAY THAT NOT TO PROTECT ME BUT TO PROTECT YOU THAT SANA IS IN EFFECTIVE WAY OF INCREASING THE ACTIVITY OF THE INNATE AMUNE SYSTEM IT INCREASES LUCOSITE LEVELS YES IT INCREASES CORTIS ALL LEVELS BUT IN A WAY THAT PROMOTE THE ACTIVITY OF THE INATE AMUN SYSTEM HOWEVER AND HERE WE ARE BACK TO EXACTLY THE SAME THING WE SAID ABOUT EXERCISE IF YOU'RE ALREADY FEELING REALLY RUN DOWN FEELING ON A HEAVINESS IN THE BODY YOU DON'T FEEL WELL YOUS TRYING TO GET SOME SNIFFOLES DON'T GET IN A VERY HOT SANA BUT FOR SAKE OF KEEPING COLDS IN FLUES AT BAY SURE DO THREE ROUNDS OF FIFTEEN MINUTES IN THE SNA BETWEEN A HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX DEGREES TWO HNDRED TEN DEGREES WHATEVER YOU CAN SAFELY TOLERATE TAKE THOSE TWO MINUTE BREAKS IN BETWEEN MAY BE DO A COLD SHOWER OR COOLISH SHOWER MAY BE JUST STAND OUTSIDE THE SANA AND BETWEEN YOU'RE FEELING REALLY STRONG DO A COAL PLUNGE FOR A MENUTE OR TWO MINUTES IN BETWEEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUT YOU CERTAINLY COULD AND THEN GET BACK IN AND THEN REPEAT OR JUST DO ONE TWENTY MINUTE SESSION OR THIRTY MINUTE SESSION ALL OF WHICH HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO PROMOTE THE ACTIVITY THE NNATEAMUN SYSTEM HOWEVER AND I REALIZE HAS SAID THIS BEFORE BUT FEEL LIKE I NEED TO SAY TO GAIN ESPECIALLY FOR YOU HARD COURT EXERCISERS OR PEOPLE THAT REALLY FEEL LIKE I CAN PUSH THROUGH IF YOU'RE ALREADY SICK AND YOU HAVE THE SYMPTOMS OF A COLDER FLUE YOU WANT TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF STRESS TO YOUR BODY YOU WANT TO GET INTO BED AND SLEEP IF YOU CAN'T SLEEP YOU WANT A RELAX YOU DO NOT WANT TO EXERCISE YOU SHOULD NOT EXERCISE NOT ONLY DO YOU STAND TO GET OTHER PEOPLE ILL BY GOING PLACES WHERE YOU EXERCISE BUT EVEN IF YOU EXERCISE AT HOME OR IN TOTAL ISOLATION YOU'RE GOING TO PROLONG THE DURATION OF THAT ILLNESS BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY MANY REASONS WHY BEING STILL SLOWING YOUR CIRCULATION AND ALLOWING YOUR INATE AND THEN IN THAT CASE YOU'RE ADAPTOF IMION SYSTEM TO KICK IN AND COMBAT THOSE INFECTIONS IS GOING TO GET YOU BACK INTO A REGULAR EXERCISE IND WORK REGIMENT MUCH MUCH FASTER THAN WOULD BE THE CASE IF YOU WERE TO PUSH THROUGH O CASE O NOW WE GET TO THE PORTION OF THE DISCUSSION THAT I THINK PROBABLY MANY PEOPLE ARE ANTICIPATING WHICH IS WHAT CAN YOU TAKE TO REDUCE THE PROBABILITY OF GETTING A COLDER FLUE OR SHORT EN THE DURATION OF A COLDER FLUE AND I ACTUALLY PUT OUT A CALL ON SOCIAL MEDIA I ASKED THE QUESTION ON INSTERGRAM AND ON X FORMERLY CALLD TWITTER NO WHAT AE YOU DO FOR A COLD OR FLUE AND WHA AE YOU CURIOUS ABOUT IN TERMS OF WHAT ONE CAN TAKE FOR COLDER FLUE AND I GOT THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF ANSWERS HOWEVER MANY OF THOSE ANSWERS CONVERGED ON SOME COMMON THINGS THINGS LIKE TAKING GARLIC I HEARD FOR INSTANCE THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE CHEWING A RAW CLOVE OF GARLICE EVERY DAY DURING THE WINTER A I HEARD ABOUT PEOPLE WHO TAKE FERMENTED GARLIC SOME PEOPLE SWEAR BY ECANATIA SOME PEOPLE SWEAR ABY ECANATIA VITEMANCY AN ZINC NOW THERE ARE FAR TOO MANY COMPOUNDS THAT EXIST IN THE WELLNESS AND INDEED IN THE MEDICAL LITERATURE TO COVER ALL OF THEM SOME GOING TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW THAT I THINK ARE ESPECIALLY INTERESTING AND THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN IMPURE VIEWED SCIENCE TO BE POTENTIALLY USEFUL SOME OF THESE YOU'VE HEARD OF BEFORE AND SOME OF THEM I THINK ARE GOING TO BE SURPRISING OR AT LEAST NEW TO YOU FIRST LET'S CONSIDER WHAT MOST PEOPLE BELIEVE TO BE A VERY EFFECTIVE WAY TO HASTEN COLDS OR FLUES THAT IS TO MAKE THEM LAST SHORTER DURATION OF TIME THAN THEY WOULD OTHERWISE MAYBE VEN PREVENT COLDS OR FLUES THE BIG ONE THERE IS VITEMANCE WE HARE ALL THE TIME VITEMANC ANTIOCCIDENT I GREW UP IN ANARIA WARE THE NOMWELL PRIZE WINNING CHEMIS LINAS PAULING WHO IS A FANATIC ABOUT VITEMANCY HE TOOK MANY MANY GRAMS OF VITEMN CEE EACH DAY USED TO TOUT THE BENEFITS OF VITEMAN CE HERE'S THE DEAL THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE AND IT'S NOT GREAT FRANKLY THAT POINTS OF THE FACT THAT TAKING SIX TO EIGHT GRAMS GRAHMS SO THAT SIX THOUSAND EIGHT THOUSAND MILIGRAMS A VITEM AN CEE PERDATE THAT IS A LOT OF VITEMAND CEE EACH DAY CAN PERHAPS TO LAY THE ONSET OF A COLD OR SHORTEN THE DURATION OF A COLD SO HERE WERE TOING BUT VERY HIDOSES AND NOT A VERY ROBUST EFFECT SHOULD MENTION THAT FOR MOST PEOPLE WHO AREN'T ACCUSTOMED TO TAKING MUCH VITEMAND C IF YOU WERE TO TAKE SIX TO EIGHT GRAHAMS OF VITEMANCY IN CAPSIL OR POWDER OR PILL FORM CHANCES ARE YOURE GOING TO EXPERIENCE SOME SIGNIFICANT GASTRIC DISTRESS SOME PEOPLE CAN BUILD UP TO THAT LEVEL OR TAKE IT WITH FOOD IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T CAUSE THAT GASTRIC DISTRESS BUT MANY PEOPLE EXPERIENCE GASTRIC DISTRESS IS BEEN A LOT SET ABOUT VITEMANCY AND ITS OTHER POTENTIAL ROLLS IND AURE PHYSIOLOGY AND I DO'T WANT TO TOUCH ON THOSE NOW BECAUSE IT MAY HAVE SOME INTERESTING ROLLS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR PHYSIOLOGY BUT HAVE TO SAY THAT IN SCOURING THE LITERATURE ON VITEM AND CE I ENCOUNTERED A RECENT PAPER SO THIS WAS PUBLISHON TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND THE TITLE THIS PAPER IS RETRACTION EXTRA DOSE OF VITEMANCY BASED ON THE DAILY SUPPLEMENTATION SHORTENS THE COMMON COLD AMETA ANALYSIS OF NINE RANOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS WHAT IS THIS PAPER THAT WAS RECENTLY PUBLISHED WHY IS RETRACTION THE FIRST WORD IN THE TITLE WELL TURNS OUT THAT THE META ANALYSIS OF NINE RANEMIZED CONTROL TRIALS SHOWING A SMALL BUT SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE OUTCOMES FOR COLDS AND FLUES OR REDUCTION IN PROBABILITY OF GETTING COLDS AND FLUES THAT STUDY WAS RETRACTED AND IT WAS RETRACTED ON THE BASIS OF MULTIBLE INSTANCES OF AN ERROR IN WHICH THE PLOCIBO GROUPS HAD BEEN DOUBLE COUNTED IN TRIALS MORE THAN THE TWO INTERVENTION ARM SO THERE WERE SOME SERIOUS DATA ANALYSIS FLAWS IN THAT META ANALYSIS NOW THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT VITEMANCY IS OF ZERO BENEFIT FOR REDUCING THE PROBABILITY OF COLDS AND FLUES BUT MUST SAY PROVIDED THAT YOUR GETTING SUFFICIENT MOUNTS OF VITEMANCY FROM YOUR FOOD AN TAKE MAY BE ALSO  LOBIT NEAR VITEM IN MINERAL SUPPLEMENTOR IF YOU TAKE A FOUNDATIONAL SUPPLEMENT LIKE A G ONE OR SOMETHING SIMILAR ALMOST CERTAINLY YOU'R GETTING ENOUGH VITEM AN CE IT DOES NOT SEEM THAT TAKING HIDOSES OF VITEM AN C AND I WOULD PLACE SIXT E GRAHAMS OF VITEM ANCY IN THE HIDOSE RANGE IS GOING TO BE AFFACTIVE FOR TREATING OR PREVENTING COLDS AND FLUES SO MORE DATA MAY ARRIVE IN THEN YOUR FUTURE BUT VITMANCY IS PROBLIY OT A VERY GOOD INVESTMENT IF YOU'RE TAKING IT SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENHANCING EURMEAN SYSTEND FUNCTION AND STAVING OFF COLDS AND FLUES NOW WHAT ABOUT VITEM IND WE HERE A LOT THESE DAYS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING SUFFICIENT VITEM IN D LEVELS AND IDEALLY EVERYONE WOULD GET THE VITEM IN D LEVELS MEASURED BY REGULAR BLOODDOES I DO GET MY BLOOD WORKED ON EVERY SIX MONTHS I FIND IT BE INCREDIBLY INFORMATIVE TELLS ME WHAT'S GOING ON BELOW THE HOOD IN WAYS THAT I NEVER COULD BE AWARE OF WERE I NOT TO GET THAT TESTS BUT I REALIZE THAT THE'S A COSTS TO THOSE TESTS AND NOT EVERYONE CAN AFFORD THEM I THINK MOST PHYSICIANS WOULD AGREE THAT SUPPLEMENTING WITH ANYWHERE FROM A THOUSAND TO TWO THOUSAND I OU A VITEM IND PER DAY IS PROBABLY SAFE FOR MOST PEOPLE AND WILL BUFFER THAT LEVEL OF VITEM INDIAN THEIR SYSTEM SUCH THAT THEIR UNLIKELY TO BE DEFICIENT AND UNLIKELY TO FAR EXCEED WHAT SAFE IN THE BODY HOWEVER THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO NEED HIGHER LEVELS OF VITEM IN D SUPPLEMENTATION IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS OF VITEM IND FOR THEIR MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL HEALTH A INVIEM IND IS INVOLVED IN A LOT OF DIFFEN PROCESSIES IN THE BRAIN AND BODY NOW IT IS CLEAR THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE VITEM INDEED DEFICIENT SO THESE ARE PEOPLE WHOSE VITEM IN DE LEVELS HAVE BEEN MEASURED OFTENTIMES HAVE DIMINISHED IMMUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION AND ARE MORE PRONE TO ACUTE RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS THE S E VERY LANGTHY AND VERY INTERESTING REVIEW ENTITLE VITEM AN D SUPPLEMENTATION TO PREVENT ACUTE RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW IN METANALYSIS OF INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPANT DATA THIS IS A BEAST OF A THING AM I DID READ IT ALL VERY VERY INTERESTING MANY MANY STUDIES THE EXACT TAKE AWAYS FROM A LARGE REVIEW LIKE THIS OF TWENTY FIVE RENTIMIZED CONTROL TRIALS IS A LITTLE BIT TRICKY I MEAN THEY DID CONCLUDE THAT VITEM AND D SUPPLEMENTATION DID REDUCE THE RISK OF ACUTE RESPIRATORY TRACT IN FACTION AMONG ALL THE PARTICIPENCE HOWEVER THE DEGREE OF PREVENTION WAS SMALL TOMODERATE IN SOME CASES THEY DID POINT OUT HOWEVER THAT JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE WITH LOW LEVELS OF ITEM IND TEND TO GET COLDS IN FLUES MORE OFTEN THAN PEOPLE THAT DON'T DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT VITEM IND DEFICIENCIES ARE THE REASON FOR THAT FOR INSTANCE WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE THEY GET REGULAR SUNLIGHT EXPOSURE AND AS EVERY ONE KNOWS I'MA BIG BIG PROPONENT OF GETTING SUNLIGHT IN YOUR EYES AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE IN THE DAY AFTER WAKING UP AND IF IT'S CLOUDY OUT TO GET EVEN MORE TIME OUTSIDE IF YOU KAN AND IF YOU CAN'T GET ACCESS TO SUNLIGHT FOR WHATEVER REASON TO PERHAPS INVEST IN A TEN THOUSAND LOCKS LIGHT TABLET YOU CAN FIND THESE UNLINE AT REASONABLE COST IN A HUNDRED DOLLARS TO TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS IN SOME CASES GETTING SUNLIGHT SETS IN MOTION A HUGE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS INCLUDING INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF VITEM IND IN YOUR SYSTEM BUT A BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS AS WELL INCREASES IN CARTAS ALL INCREASES IN DOPEM AND INCREASES CERETONAN THAT CASCADE TOWARD AND RELATE TO INPROVED IN MUN SYSTEM FUNCTION SO WHAT IS THE TAKE AWAY HERE I THINK THAT FOR MOST PEOPLE SUPPLEMENTING WITH A THOUSAND TO TWO THOUSAND INTERNATIONAL NUDS OF VITEMND IS PROBABLY SAFE HOWEVER IF YOU NEED MORE VITEM IND YOU WON'T KNOW THAT UNLESS YOU TAKE A VIEMIND TAST THAT IS YOU MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF VIEMIND IN YOUR BLOOD STREAM AND SOME PEOPLE INDEED NEED FIVE THOUSAND TO TEN THOUSAND I U OF VITEM IND PER DAY BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO OVERDOSE YOURSELF ON VITEMIND THAT IS IF YOU ALREADY HAVE SUFFICIENTLY HIGH LEVELS OF VITEM IND IN YOUR SYSTEM YOU'RE GETTING SUFFICIENT SUNLIGHT WELL THEN TAKING TEN THOUSAN OR MORE INTERNATIONAL EUTS OF VITEMIND COULD POSSIBLY BE DETRIMENTAL I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY BASED ON THE METANALYSIS AND REVIEW THAT I MENTION A MOMENT AGO THE OTHER PAPERS THAT I WAS ABLE TO GLEAN THAT VITE EM IND ITSELF IS UNLIKELY TO B THE SOLE PROTECTANT AGAINST COLDS AND FLUES BUT IT'S PROBABLY A GOOD THING TO INCLUDE IN YOUR GENERAL KIT OF NUTRICION AND SUPPLEMENTATION TOOLS IF YOUR GOAL IS TO KEEP YOUR INATE IN YOUR SYSTEM FIGHTING OFF COLDS AND FLUES SUFFICIENTLY OTHER THINGS THAT CN PERHAPS SUPPORT THE ANATEMIUN SYSTEM ARE GOING TO BE AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE THINGS THAT SUPPORT THEY GOTMICROBAIUM SO THOSE LOS SUGAR FOR MENTED FOODS MAY BE A PREBADIC PROBIOTIT CAPSIL MAY BE SOMETHING LIKE ITHLETIC GREENS AG U ONE ALTHOUGH CERTAINLY YOU COULD ACHIEVES SUFFICIENT MICROBIUM SUPPORT FROM FOODS IF YOUR CAREFUL AND INTENTIONAL ABOUT THE FOODS THAT YOUR SELECT NOW THE OTHER COMPOUND OR SUBSTANCE THAT WE OFTEN HEREABOUT IN THE CONTECTS OF COLDS AR FLUES IS ECANATIA ECANATIA IS A COMPOUND THAT AS BEEN PROPOSE TO IMPROVE A MUN SYSTEM FUNCTION NOW WHEN YOU GO INTO THE DATA AND YOU EXPLORE WHAT DOES TAKING ECANATIA TINCTURES OR OTHER FORMS OF ECANATIA REALLY DO TO AVOID COLDS AND FLUES THE ANSWER THAT COMES BACK IS NOT MUCH IF ANYTHING NOW IS TAKING ECANATIA DANGEROUS PROBABLY NOT HOWEVER IT HAS BEEN SHOWN IN A FEW STUDIES THAT PEOPLE THAT TAKE AT CANATIA REGULARLY AT HIGH DOSES CAN POTENTIALLY IMPEDE THE FUNCTION OF THEIR INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM THAT IS REDUCTIONS IN WHITE BLOOD SELL COUNT REDUCTIONS IN THOSE NATURAL KILL ER CELLS SO MY SUGGESTION WOULD BE IF YOU ABSOLY LOVE AC AT CANATIA FOR WHATEVER REASON YOU'RE CONVINCED THAT IT HELPS YOU THAT YOU RESERVE TO TAKING IT WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO FEEL LITTLE BIT RUN DOWN OR PERHAPS JUST IN THE WINTER MONTH NOT MONTHS PLUREL BUT MONTH WHEN YOU'RE MOST PRONE TO THOSE COLD AND FLUENT FECTIONS BUT THEN NOT TAKING IT CONTINUOUSLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AND CERTAINLY NOT FOR MORE THAN FOUR WEEKS AT A TIME BUT AGAIN IF YOU'RE DOING THAT JUSTS KNOW THAT THERE AREN'T REALLY ANY STRONG SCIENTIFIC DAY TO SUPPORT THE USE OF ECANATIA BY CONTRAST THEY ARE PRETTY DARN GOOD DATA THAT SUPPORT SUPPLEMENTING WITH ZINC AS A WAY TO COMBAT COLDS AND FLUES IN PARTICULAR COLDS NOW HERE THE DOSAGES REALY MATTER IT'S BEEN SHOWN THAT IF YOU TAKE LESS THAN SEVENTY FIVE MILIGRAMS OF ZINC INSUPPLEMENT FORM TO TRYING IMPACT THE PROBABILITY OF GETTING OR SHORTENING A COMMON COLD IT'S NOT CON A WORK YOU NEED TO TAKE A HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OR MORE AND NOW A HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OR MORE OF ZINC FOR SOME PEOPLE IS GOING TO CAUSE SOME GHASTR DISTRESS IF YOU TAKE IT ON AN EMPTY STOMACH A'VE ACTUALLY MADE THE MISTAKE OF TAKING I THINK IT WAS FIFTY MILIGRAMS OF ZINCH ON AN EMPTY STOMACH AND I FELT REALLY NOUTIOUS DID NOT FEEL WELL SO DON'T TAKE ZINC ON AN EMPTY STOMACH AND IF YOU'RE TRYING TO SHORTEN A COLDOR FLUE THAT YOU THINK YOU'VE ALREADY CONTRACTED OR YOU'E TRYING TO KEEP A COLD OR FLUE AT BAY CAUSE YOU ARE ROUND PEOPLET CULTER FLUES OR YOUR JUST WORRIED ABOUT IT TAKING A HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF ZINC PERHAPS DIVIDED UP INTO TWO DOSES OF FIFTY MILIGRAMS EACH OR MAY BE A HUNDRED MILIGRAMS ALL AT ONCE BUT MAKING SURE THA YOU TAKE THAT WITH AT LEAST A MODERATELY SIZED OR FULL MEAL CERTAINLY COULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS KEEP IN MIND THAT PEOPLE THAT ARE OLDER THAN SIXTY FIVE ARE PERHAPS THE ONES THAT NEED TO SUPPLEMENT ZINC THE MOST ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT CHILDREN MEANING PEOPLE YOUNGER THAN FIFTEEN SHOULD PROBABLY NOT SUPPLEMENT WITH TOO MUCH ZINC THAT CAN BE PROBPLEMATIC AND CERTAINLY PREGNANT WOMEN SHOULD TALK TO THEIR DOCTOR BEFORE SUPPLEMENTING WITH ZNC INDEED ANY TIM YOU'REGOING TO TAKE ANYTHING WHETHERE NOT YOUR YOUNG OLD PREGNANT OR NOT YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR PHYSICIAN BEFORE YOU TAKE ANYTHING OR REMOVE ANYTHING FROM YOUR HEALTH PROTOCALS ONE OF THE MORE INTERESTING ASPECTS OF SUPPLEMENTING WITH ZINC THAT I WAS ABLE TO FIND IN THE LITERATURE IS A THREE TIMES FASTER RECOVERY RATE FOR PEOPLE THAT ALREADY CONTRACTED A COLD SO IN THIS STUDY PEOPLE WEREN'T TAKING A HUNDRED MILIGRAMS BUT THE DOSAGE CAME PRETTY CLOSE THEY WERE TAKING NINETY MILIGRAMS PER DAY OF ZINC ACETATE AND THEY EXPERIENCE A THREE TIMES FAST A RECOVERY RA T FROM THAT COLD COMPARE TO PEOPLEWHO WERE NOT TAKING THE ZINC NOW OF COURSE THERE COULD BE OTHER FACTORS AS WELL BUT THE STUDY WAS FAIRLY CONVINCING SO GIVEN THAT ZINC IS FAIRLY LO COST GIVEN THAT IT'S GENERALLY SAFE FOR MOST PEOPLE AND THE FACT THAT IF YOU TAKE IT WITH FOOD IT DOESN'T CAUSE I ANY DISCOMFORT SUPPLEMENTING WAS INC AT A LEVEL OF ANYWHERE FROM NINETY TO A HUNDRED MILEGRAMS PERDAY PROBABLY NO MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND TWENTY PER DAY SEEMS LIKEA LOGICAL WAY TO STAVE OFF COLDS AND FLUES AND REDUCED THE DURATION OF A COLD OR FLUE SHOULD YOU CONTRACT ONE NOW I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT I'VE BEN TALK ABOUT COLDS IN FLUES KIND OF IN I IN CONCERT KIND OF TREATING THEM MORE OR LESS AS THE SAME THING SOME OF THAT IS FOR SAKE OF TIME AND SIMPLICITY MOST ALL OF THE STUDY SHOWING A BENEFIT OF ZINC OUR STUDY SHOWING THE BENEFIT OF ZINC FOR THE TREATMENT OR THE HASTENING OF COLD NOT FOR FLUE SPECIFICALLY HOWEVER I CONSULTED WITH A FEW PHYSICIANS N ONE OF WHOM IS EXPERT IN THIS AREA AND HE THAT I DIDN'T SEE ANY REASON WHY YOU WOULDN'T TAKE ZINC IF YOU HAD A FLUE THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK THAT IT WOULD INTRODUCE ANY KIND OF INCREASED RISK BUT AGAIN  CONSULT WITH YOUR PHYSICION BEFORE TAKING OR REMOVING ANYTHING FROM YOUR SUPPLEMENT REGIMENT NOW A LOT OF THE COMPOUNDS THAT WERE DISCUSSING ARE SORT OF CONVENTIONAL IN THE SENSE THAT I THINK MOST PEOPLE HAVE PROBABLY HEARD OF THEM ALREADY PERHAPS THE MOST ESOTERIC SOUNDING ONE THUS FAR AS ACANATIA WHICH WE ESTABLISHED POLLY NOT VERY HELPFUL FOR COLDS ARE FLUES BUT WE VENT OI ABOUT VITHIM AND SEE WHEN WE BEN TALK ABOUT ZINC VITHIM INDEED AN YOU SURE YO GETTING YOUR SUNLIGHT SUPPORTING YOUR MICROBION AND SO ON SO ON ONE COMPOUND THAT I'M GESSING MOST PEOPLE PERHAPS HAVE NOT HEARD OF BUT THAT IS VERY INTERESTING THAT IN FACT I'VE TAKEN BEFORE AND THAT I STOC IN MY SUPPLEMENT CABINET IN CASE I FEEL LIKE I'M COMING DOWN WITH SOMETHING IS ENECIDAL SISTINE OR NACK WHAT IS NAC NACK IS A PRECURSER TO GLUDOTHION WHAT IS GLUDOTHION GLUDOTHION IS THE MASTER ANTIOXIDENT IT'S INVOLVED IN REDUCING WHAT ARE CALLED REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES WHICH BUILD UP IN CELLS THAT ARE VERY METABOLICALLY ACTIVE REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES BUILD UP EVEN MORE IN SELLS THAT ARE UNDER STRESS OR A BODY THAT'S UNDERSTRESS AND IT ALSO HAS THE PROPERTY OF REDUCING REACTIVE NITROGEN SPECIES REACTIVE OXYGEN AND REACTIVE NITROGEN SPECIES SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE UNDER CONDITIONS OF INFECTION AND HAVING SUFFICIENT LEVELS OF GLUDITHION IS A GOOD THING NOW ENECEDAL CISTINE IS USED IN CERTAIN CLINICS OVERSEES AND IN THE UASS AS A WAY TO TREAT SYSTIC FIBROSIS BECAUSE IT'S ALSO A MUCALETIC CONSISTIC FIBROSIS IS THE BUILD UP OF FLUID IN THE LUNGS AND A MUCALITIC SUBSTANCE IS SOMETHING THAT LUSENS UP THE MUCUS AND ALLOWS IT TO FLOW MORE READILY OUT OF DIFFERENT CAVITIES OFTHE BODY INCLUDING THE LUNGS THE NAZAL PASSAGES AND SCINESSES AND INDEED LAST WINTER I DID UNFORTUNATELY GET A COLD ITOLD YOU ABOUT ONCE EVERY EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR MONTHS I GET A COLD AND IT WAS A PRETTY NASTY ONE I WAS FEELING SUPERCONGESTED AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS AN EAR INFECTION PRETTY QUICKLY I REALIZED I HAD A COLD AND I WAS FEELING SO CONGESTED I WASN'T SLEEPING WELL AND IT WAS SUGGESTED TO ME TO TAKE ENECEDAL SISTI N IANDIT UP DOING THAT AT A DOSAGE OF ANYWHERE FROM SIX HUNDRED TO NINE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS THREE TIMES PER DAY SO AS A SIX HUNDRED TO NINE HUNDRED MILIGRAM CAPSUL DEPENDING ON WHICH BRANDI PURCHASED LOW DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THIS OUT THERE ON THE MARKET I TOOK IT MORNING LATE MORNING AND AFTERNOON AND INDEED IT IS A POWERFUL MUCALITIC THAT MUGUSDESTARTS FLOWING OUT A YOU BETTER HAVE AN EXTRA BOX OF TISSUES HANDY AND THAT GREATLY RELIEVE THE PRESSURE IN MY SCINESSES AND THE REASON I LIKED USING NACK IS BECAUSE I'VE ACTIVELY AVOIDED USING DECONGESTENS THAT ONE CAN PURCHASE OVER THE COUNT AR MOST ECONGESTENCS ARE OF THE ALFUL ONE AGONIST VARIETY WHAT'S AN AL FOL ONE AGONIST IT CAUSES VAZO CONSTRICTION THAT VAZO CONSTRICTION COAN BE BENEFICIAL IN PREVENTING SOME OF THE INTENSE CONGESTION THAT ONE GETS WHEN YOU GATHE A SCINESTS INFECTION OR A COLD OR A FLUE BUT THEN WHEN THOSE DECONGESTIONS WEAR OFF ONE TENDS TO GET A REBOUND INCREASE IN CONGESTION AND ITS REALLY PAINFUL HEADACHE ET CETERA IN ADDITION SOME OVER THE COUNTERDECONGESTENS CAN BE HAVE IT FORMING NOT A SARILY ADDICTIVE BUT HAVEIT FORMING AND THEY DON'T SEEM TO HAVE ANY OTHER POSITIVE HEALTH BENEFIT SO I PREFER NOT TO TAKE DECONGESTENCE IF I CAN AVOID IT I HAD A VERY GOOD EXPERIENCE WITH NACK AND THE USE OF NACK AND A SEDAL SISTINE AS A DECONGESTON AND ALSO AS A WAY TO PEVENT GETTING COLDS IN FLUES IS NOT AN ENTIRELY NEW IDEA IN FACT THERE'S A PAPER DATING BACK TO NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN ENTITLED A TENUATION OF INFLUENZ ALIKE SYMPTOMOLOGY AND IMPROVEMENT OF SELMEDIATED IMMUNITY WITH LONG TERM ANDASEEDAL SISTINE TREATMENT NOW IN THIS STUDY THEY LOOKED AT PEOPLE WERE TAKING SIX HUNDRED MILEGRAMS OF ENESEDAL SISTINE TWICE PER DAY FOR SIX MONTHS AND WHAT THE OBSERVED IS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO TOOK AND A SEDALSISTINE HAD A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER PROBABILITY OF CONTRACTING INFLUENZA NOW THIS IS BUT ONE STUDY THERE'V BEEN A FEW OTHER STUDIES AND UNFORTUNAELY THERE ISN'T A LARGE BODY OF RESEARCH LOOKING AT NACK AS A PREVENTIVE FOR COLDS IN FLUES BUT THE DAT ON THIS PAPER ARE INTERESTING ENOUGH AND I WAS COMPELLED BY THEM ENOUGH TO SEEK OUT A PHYSICION WHO I KNOTICE WAS ANSWERING MY PROMPTS ON SOCIA MEDIA ABOUT WHAT HE USE FOR COLDS AND FLUES AND WHEN I PUT THAT OUT THERE AS I MENTIONED I GOT THOUSANDS OF RESPONSES ON BOTH TWITER ACS AND ON INSTROGRAM AND ONE PARTICULAR PHYSICION WHO HAPPENS TO HAVE A OUTUBE ACCOUNT HIS NAME IS DOCTOR SCWELT HE'S A MEDICAL DOCTOR HE WORKS IN INTENSIVE CARE UNIT AND HE DEALS WITH A LOT OF PATIONTS WHO HAVE DIFFERENT STRAINS OF FLUE IN FACT HE WAS THE ONE TH CUED ME TO THE FACT THAT THIS YEAR THERE SEEMS TO BE A FAIR NUMBER OF EACH ONE AND ONE FLUVIRIS GOING AROUND AND REMEMBER THE EACH ONE AND ONE FLUVIRIS WHILE IT'S NOT YOU KNOW DEAD LEAT EVERY ONE IT CAN BE QUITE SEVERE IN SOME PEOPLE SO WE DO WANT TO BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR AND TRYING TO AVOID GETTING ECH ONE AND ONE IF WE CAN I SPOKE TO DOCTOR SCWELT HE WAS VERY GENEROUS WITH HIS KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ANDASEDAL SISTINE HE DID ACKNOWLEDGE AND I'L ACKNOWLEDGE AGAIN HERE THAT IT WOULD BE GREAT TO GET MORE RANDOMIZE CONTROL TRAL DATA ON ANASEDAL SISTINE BUT WE DID TALK ABOUT THIS PAPER THIS NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN PAPER AND HE DID MENTION THAT HE AND OTHER CLINITIONS THAT ARE FORCED TO BE IN THE HOSPITAL DEALING WITH PATIENTS ALL THROUGH THE WINTER AND ALL YOUAR LONG THE'REGETTNG BOMBARDED WITH COLD IN FLUE EXPOSURE ALL THE TIME THAT THE MEANING HE AND SOME OF HIS COLLEAGUES DELIBERATELY TAKE ENESEDIL SISTINE AS A PREVENTATIVE TO TRYIANG REDUCE THE PROBABILITY OF GETTING COLDS IN FLUECE AND WHILE WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE TOO MUCH OF ANY ONE STUDY OR ANEC DATA WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE DESCRIBING WHEN I TELL YOU ABOUT A PHYSICIAN WHO TOLD ME THIS OR WHAT I DID AND EXPERIENCE THAT I THINK IT IS WORTH PARAPHRASING THE STUDY THAT I MENTIONED BEFORE AN S PREVENTED THE SYMPTEMATIC FORMS CAUSE BY HERE THE TONGUE UF THE A EH ONE AND ONE INFLUENCE OF VIRUS QUITE EFFICIENTLY SINCE THE LARGE MAJORITY OF INFECTED SUBJECTS IN THE PLECEBO GROUP SEVENTY NINE PER CENT DEVELOPED CLINICALLY APPARENT DISEASE VERSES ONLY TWENTY FIVE PER CENT IN THE NAT GROUP IN OTHER WORDS APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY PER CENT OF PEOPLE IN THES STUDY WHO DID NOT TAKE ENEEDAL SISTNE GOT INFLUENZA WHEREAS ONLY TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE TAKING ENESEDL SISTINE CONTRACTED INFLUENZA SO THAT'S A FAIRLY DRAMATIC DIFFERENCE AND CERTAINLY THE FACT THAT ENESEEDEL SISTINE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE GLUDIFION THAT'S IT'S PRIMARY MECHANISM OF ACTION AS FAR AS WE KNOW AND THE FACT THAT INCREASES IN GLUDITHIONOR GENERALLY HEALTHY AND GOOD FOR US AND THE FACT THAT ANESEDAL SISTINE IS STILL AVAILABLE LEGALLY OVER THE COUNTER AND THE OUASS AT LEAST CURRENTLY IT IS TE SOME YEARS BACK AS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THE FT E CALLED FOR REMOVAL OF ENESEDIL SISTINE FROM OVER THE COUNTER SALES THAT I SHOULD POINT OUT WAS BASED ON THE FACT THAT CERTAIN SUPPLEMENT COMPANIES WERE MAKING CLAIMS ABOUT ANESEDAL SISTINE AS A TREATMENT FOR HANG OVER AND MAKING A BUNCH OF OTHER CLAIMS FOR WHICH THERE WAS NO REAL DATA BUT EITHER BECAUSE THE FT E WAS EFFECTIVE IN GETTING THOSE COMPANIES TO CEASE THOSE CLAIMS AND OR BECAUSE OF ADVOCASI GROUPS WHICH WORKED VERY HARD TO TRYIND KEEP ENEEDIL SISTINE AVAILABLE FOR OVER THE COUNTER SALES AS FAR AS I KNOW AT LEAST RIGT UP UNTIL PRIOR TO RECORDING THIS EPISODE ENESEDAL SISTINE IS AVAILABLE FOR SALE OVER THE COUNTER SO WHETHER NOT YOU DECIDE TO USE ENESEDAL SISTINE AS A PREVENTATIVE AND THERE AGAIN THE DOSAGE IS ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED MILEGRAMS PER DAY DIVIDED INTO TWO DIFFERENT DOSAGES OF SIX HUNDER MILEGRAMS EACH OR IF YOU DECIDE TO TAKE ENESEDL SISTINE IN THE MANNER THAT I DID WHICH WAS NOT AS A PREVENTATIVE BUT ONCE I HAD A COLD CONFIDEIT OFF APPARENTLY GOT THE COLD DECIDE TO TAKE NINE HUNDRED MILEGRAMS THREE TIMES PER DAY AVOIDING THAT IN TAKE CLOSE TO SLEEP BECAUSE IT DID DISRUPT MY SLEEP IF I TOOK IT TWO CLOSE TO SLEEP BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THE MUCUS WOULD FLOW SO READILY WOULD YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY I KNOW IT SOUNDS GROSE BY FELLY G WAS FILLING UP THE BACK OF MY THROAT SO CALL POSTNASAL DRIP BUT IT FELT LIKE POST NADAL WATERFALL AND I DECIDE TO RESTRICT MY ANTAKE OF ENESEDIL SISTINE TO EARLIER IN THE DAY ONLY AND OF COURSE THERE'S THE THIRD OPTION WHICH IS THAT YOU OUGHT TO NOT TAKE NESEDIL ISTINE UNTIL MORE RHENOMIZE CONTROL TRIALS ARE PUBLISHED WE'RE NOT TAKE ENEEDL SISTINE AT ALL BECAUSE YOU'RE OF THE SORT THAT THINKS OKE WITH SOME SLEEP AHOT SHOWER A GOOD MEAL SOME CHICKEN SOUP A BELO GARLIC WHO KNOWS IF YOU HAVE SOME OTHER TOOLS IN TECHNIQUES THAT YOU LI IKE OU LIKE THAT GINGER TA LEMIN ET CETERA MAYBE THAT'S ALL YOU NEED AND IF THAT'S ALL YOU NEED AND THAT'S ALL YOU WANT IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH A COLD OR FLUE BE MY GAST I CERTAINLY AM NOT HERE TO CONVINCE ANYONE THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE A SERTAIN SUPPLEMENT BUT I DID FEEL LIKE IW E REMISS IF I DIDN'T COVER WHAT ARE GENERALLY REFERD TO AS THE SO CALLED PREVENTATIVES AND TREATMENTS FOR COLDS AND FLUES THINGS LIKE ZING FIDEM INDE VITEMAN SE WE NOW KNOW THAT UNFORTUNATELY VENEMEN S GETS A YOU KNOW PRIVE DEMINU SUR AN AF AT LEAST AS THE DATA STAND NOW BUT THER THESE OTHER THINGS LIKE ZING AND POTENTIALLY AND A SEETAL SISTING THAT CAN BE BENEFICIAL IN SHORTENING THE DURATION OF COLDS OR FLUES AND PERHAPS EVEN HELPING US AVOID

WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LATPONCAS  O SCIENCE SCIENCE PAC TO FRLI I M INDRHUBERMAN AND OM A PROFESSOR OF NERBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY WE ARE DISCUSSING HAIR HAIR IS A TOPIC THAT OCCUPIES THE MINDS OF MANY PEOPLE THERE ARE PEOPLE THOTHAT ARE LOSING THEIR HAIR AND WANT TO HALT OR REVERSE THAT LOSS OF HAIR AND TO DAY WE WILL TALK ABOUT ALL THE WAYS THAT SCIENCE HAS TAUGHT US WE CAN SLOW OR EVEN REVERSE HAIR LOSS I CONFESS THAT RESEARCHING TO DAY'S TOPIC WAS A PARTICULAR JOY FOR ME NOT BECAUSE I 'M OBSESSED WITH HAIR MINE OR THE HAIR OF OTHERS BUT BECAUSE HAIR TURNS OUT TO BE FASCINATING FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CELLER BIOLOGY AND STEMCELLS WHICH IS A TOPIC THAT HAVE LONG BEEN INTERESTED IN AND THAT FOR MUCH OF MY CAREER I FOCUSSED ON IN THE CONTEXT OF DEVELOPMENT SO WHEN YOUR BRAIN AND YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM DEVELOP IT DEVELOPS FROM A SMALL BATCH OF CELLS THAT TURNS INTO MANY MANY TRILIANS OF CELLS AND IT DOES THAT BY SELL REPLICATION SOMETHING THAT WE CALL THE CELL CYCHL AND WILL TALK A LI IFIT ABOUT THIS AND SO CALLED MY TOSISTS TO DAY I PROMISE NOT TO GET INTO TOO MUCH DETAIL BUT WHAT MAKES HAIR SO VERY INTERESTING FROM A BIOLOGICAL STANDPOINT IS THAT EVERY HAIR EVERY SINGLE INDIVIDUAL STRAND OF HAIR HAS ITS OWN LITTLE STEMCELL NICHE MEANING ITS OWN LITTLE POCKET DOWN THERE IN THE FOLOCAL IN WHICH SPECIFIC STEMCELLS GIVE RISE TO THOSE HAIRS FOR DIFFERENT DURATIONS OF TIME DEPENDING ON THE HAIR WHERE IT IS ON YOUR BODY ET CETERA SO FIR INSTANCE THE HAIRS ON YOUR HEAD WILL UNDERGO ON GOING GROWTH FOR FOUR TO SIX OR EVEN EIGHT YEARS SO WERE YOU TO NOT CUT YOUR HAIR IT WOULD CONTINUE TO GROW ONE SINGLE HAIR WOULD CONTINUE TO GROW I GESS WE COULD SAY ALL THE HAIRS WILL CONTINUE TO GROW FOR UP TO EIGHT YEARS THAT IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM FOR INSTANCE YOUR EYEBROWS WHICH HAVE A MUCH SHORTER PERIOD OF HAIR GROWTH LAST NG ON THE ORDER OF MONTHS THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T SEE PEOPLE WITH EYEBROWS THAT EXTEND DOWN TO THEIR WAIST BUT YOU CAN SEE PEOPLE WITH HAIR ON THEIR HEAD THAT EXTENDS DOWN TO THEIR WAIST IF THEY DON'T CUT IT NOW THAT DISCREPANCY ILLUSTRATES FOR US JUST HOW INCREDIBLE HAIR FOLICALS AND THE STEMSELVES THAT RESIDE WITH INHAIRS ARE AND THEIR ENORMOUS POTENTIAL TO GIVE RISE TO THESE THINGSTHAT WE CALL HAIRS WHICH ARE SIMPLY PROTENES OF VARYING LENGTH SO TO DAY WE ARE GOING TO ADDRESS WHAT DETERMINES THE LENGTH OF A HAIR OR RATHER WHAT DETERMINES HOW LONG A HAIR CONTINUES TO GROW BEFORE IT CEASES GROWING AND EVENTUALLY FALLS OUT E'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHAT REGULATES THOSE STEMSELVES WHAT ALLOWS THEM TO CONTINUE TO PRODUCE HAIR OR CEASE PRODUCING HAIR AND AS WE DO THAT YOU WILL LEARN ALL THE BIOLOGY IN CLEAR SIMPLE TERMS REGARDLESS OF YOUR BACKGROUND THAT WILL REALLY SET THE STAGE FOR UNDERSTANDING WHAT WILL ALSO TALK ABOUT WHICH IS HOW TO SLOW HAIR LOSS OR HALT HAIR LOSS ENTIRELY OR EVEN REVERSE HAIR LOSS SO WE WILL TALK ABOUT HORMON RELATED HAIR LOSS IN BOTH MEN AND WOMEN WE WILL TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE MECHANICAL AND STRESS RELATED INFLUENCES ON HAIR LOSS AND WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE CHEMICAL AND MECHANICAL APPROACHES TO HALTING AND REVERSING HAIR LOSS EVERYTHING FROM MENOXIDIL TO DO TASTERIDE TO QITOCONISAL TO MICRO NEEDLING TO FIROID ESTEROGEN IGEI ONE PATHWAYS AGAIN ALL MADE VERY CLEAR REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT YOU HAVE A BACKRON IN BIOLOGY OR NOT I WILL ALSO DISPEL SOME OF THE COMMON MYTHS ABOUT BALDING AND HAIR REPLACEMENT IF YOU'VE HEARD FOR INSTANCE THAT YOU INHERIT YOUR PATTERNS OF BALDING FROM YOUR MOTHER'S FATHER THAT IS NOT TRUE ALTHOUGH IT IS TRUE THAT YOU DO INHERIT CERTAIN GENES THAT INFLUENCE WHETHER NOT YOU HAVE A PREDISPOSITION TO BALDING IN PARTICULAR PARTS OF YOUR HEAD AND BELIEVE ARE NOT EVEN PARTICULAR PARTS OF YOUR BODY BUT IT IS NOT THE CASE THAT YOU CAN SIMPLY FIND A PHOTO OF YOUR MOTHER'S FATHER SAY IS AGE FIFTY O R AGE SIXTY OR SEVENTY FIVE AND DETERMINE WHETHER NOT YOU'LL HVE THE EXACT SAME PATTERN OF HAIRLOSS SO THAT'S A MYTHTHAD I'D LIKE TO DISPELL RIGHT HERE AND NOW AND I WILL DISPEL SOME OFTHE OTHER MYTHS ABOUT HAIR LOSS HAIR REPLACEMENT AND HAIR REGROWTH AS WELL BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING IN RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTOC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TODAY'S PODCASS OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTROLITE DRINK WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS PLENTY OF SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM THE SO CALLED ELECTROLYTES AND NO SUGAR NOW SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS IN YOUR BODY IN PARTICULAR TO THE FUNCTION OF YOUR NERVE CELLS ALSO CALLED NURONS IN FACT IN ORDER FOR YOUR NURONS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY ALL THREE ELECTROLYTES NEED TO BE PRESENT IN THE PROPER RATIOS AND WE NOW KNOW THAT EVEN SLIGHT REDUCTIONS IN ELECTROLITE CONCENTRATIONS OR DEHYDRATION OF THE BODY CAN LEAD TO DEPHISITES IN COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCES ELEMENT CONTAINS A SCIENCE BACK TELECTOROLITE RATIO OF ONE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS THAT ONE GRAHAM OF SODIUM TWO HUNDER MILIGRAMS OF POTASSIUM AND SIXTY MILIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM I TYPICALLY DRINK ELEMENT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP IN ORDER TO HYDRATE MY BODY AND MAKE SURE I HAVE ENOUGH ELECTROLYTES AND WHILE I DO ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL TRAINING AND AFTER PHYSICAL TRAINING AS WELL ESPECIALLY IF I'VE BEEN SWEATING LOT IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMENTE DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE AGAIN THAT'S DRINK ELEMENT ELEMENTE DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN OKE LET'S TALK ABOUT HAIR AND IN RESEARCHING THIS EPISODE BY TALKING TO EXPERTS IN THE BIOLOGY OF HAIR AND THE STEMCELS THAT EXIST IN ALL OF US THAT GIVE RISE TO OUR HAIR GROWTH AND THE PIGMENTATION IN OUR HAIR AND IN TALKING TO EXPERTS WHO UNDERSTAND HOW TO HALT AND EVEN REVERSE HAIR LOSS THAT THERE IS A TREMENDOUSLY INTERESTING BIOLOGY SER OWNING HAIR BUT THERE'S ALSO AN INCREDIBLE PSYCHOLOGY AROUND HAIR IN FACT MOST PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCE EVEN MARGINAL HAIR LOST UNDERGO PRETTY SEVERE ANXIETY NOW I CONFESS THIS IS NOT SOMETHING I CAN RELATE TO I AM LOSING MY HAIR IN CERTAIN PLACES I'M FORTY SEVEN YEARS OLD I'VE GOT COUPLE PATCHES UP FRONT WHERE THERE'S VERY MINABLE HAIR I THINK THAT AS WE'LL LAT OR LEARN IN THIS EPISODE REFLECTS A HIGHER DENSITY OF D H T DIHYDROTISTOSTERON AM RECEPTOR'S AT THAT PARTICULAR LOCATION ASPOST ELSEWHERE IN MY SCALP BUT KEEPING MY HAIR IS NOT SOMETHING THAT I'VE FRETTED ABOUT MUCH OF MY LIFE AND YET AS I WAS RESEARCHING THIS EPISODE I REMEMBERED AN ANECDOTE FOR MY CHILDHOOD WHERE MY FATHER TOLD ME AND I THINK IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS STRESSING ABOUT SOMETHING AND I WAS TRYING TO GET TO SLEEP AND HE SAID DON'T STRESS CALM DOWN AND HEAR'S WHY IF YOU STRESS TOO MUCH IT CAN ACTUALLY MAKE YOUR HAIR FALL OUT IN FACT I HAVE A COUSIN WHO LAY DOWN ONE NIGHT STRESSED AND WOKE UP THE NEXT MORNING AND ALL OF HIS HAIR WAS ON HIS PILLOW AND I I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT STORY I THINK HE WAS TRYING TO GET ME TO STRESS LESS I DON'T KNOW F THAT STORY MADE ME STRESS LESS OR NOT AH BUT IN ANY EVENT I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT STORYIS TRUE I'M NOT IN A CHALLENGE THE AUTHENTICITY OF THAT STORY I DIDN'T HVE A CHANCE TO REACH OUT TO MY MY FATHER AND ASK HIM UM TO VERIFY OR NOT BUT AS WE'LL SOON LEARN IT IS TRUE THAT OUR PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL BEING CAN IMPACT BOTH THE COLERATION OR LACK THEREOF AND THE GROWTH RATES OF OUR HAIR THAT'S A REAL THING AND THE REVERSE IS ALSO TRUE WHICH IS THAT AS HAIR STARTS TO THIN OR FALL OUT OR CHANGE COLOR MANY PEOPLE EXPERIENCE INTENSE ANXIETY OR EVEN DEPRESSION THIS WAS NOT SOMETHING I WAS REALLY AWARE OF PERHAPS THAT'S JUST BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS KEPT MY HAIR PRETTY SHORT ANYWAY I WAS ASSUME THAT MY HAIR START TO REALLY FALL OUT TO SHAPE MY HEAD BUT THAT'S ME AND THAT'S NOT MOST PEOPLE OUT THERE I THINK MOST PEOPLE UM WOULD LOTH TO LOSE THEIR HAIR AND IN FACT GIVEN THE ENORMOUS NUMBER PROBABLY UP IN THE HIGH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND EUROS AND OTHER CURRENCY OF COURSE THAT PEOPLE IN VEST IN TRYING TO HALT OR REVERSE THEIR HAIR LOSS IT'S CLEAR THAT HAIR IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT BY AGE FIFTY APPROXIMATELY FIFTY PER CENT OF ALL MEN AND WOMEN WILL HAVE EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH HAIR LOSS THAT THEY START TO NOTICE IT AND A LARGE PERCENTAGE UP TO EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT OF THOSE PEOPLE WILL EXPERIENCE SOME SORT OF ANXIETY THAT LEADS THEM TO GO OUT AND TRY IN EITHER HALT OR REVERSE THAT HAIR LOSS NOW WHYAT AGE FIFTY WELL AN IMPORTANT POINT ARISES FROM THAT WHICH IS THAT THE HAIR LOSS IS NOT OCCURRING BETWEEN THE FORTY NINTH AND FIFTIETH BIRTHDAY HAIR LOSS IS ON GOING FROM ABOUT AGE THIRTY TO AGE FIFTY IT'S ONLY BY AGE FIFTY HOWEVER THAT ABOUT FIFTY PER CENT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE START TO NOTICE THAT HIR LOSS AND THIS IS TYPICALLY BECAUSE THEY'LLNOW THEY'LL BE IN A A BATH ROOM OR LOOKING IN A MIRROR AND ON THE LIGHTING WILL BE BRIGHT ENOUGH THAT IT PERMEATES THE THA THE S OROUDER BOUNDARY OF THEIR HIR ANDTHE'LL NOTICE THAT THEIR HAIR IS THINNING IN A PARTICULAR LOCATION AT'S USUALLY HAW THE SORT OF THING HAPPENS SO AGAIN OUR PSYCHOLOGICAL STATES CAN IMPACT OUR PATTERNS OF HAIR GROWTH OR LOSS AND OF COURSE PATTERNS OF HAIR GROWTH BUT MORE TYPICALLY HAIR LOSS AND HAIR GRAYING CAN REALLY IMPACT PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE SO THIS IS A SUBJECT THAT PEOPLE TAKE INTENSE INTEREST IN AND TO DAY WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW HAIR NORMALLY GROWS WHY IT GROWS AT THE RATE AND FOR THE DURATION THAT IT HAPPENS TO AND THEN AS WE TALK ABOUT WAYS TO INTERVENE WITH THAT HAIR LOSS THOSE BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS WILL COME UP BECAUSE THEY REALLY PROVIDE A NICE FRAMEWORK FOR EXPLAINING WHY CERTAIN TREATMENTS WORK MORE OR LESS WELL OR WHY CERTAIN TREATMENTS MIGHT HAVE CERTAIN SIDE EFFECTS OR TOTAL LACK OF SIDE EFFECTS IT WILL ALSO HIHLITE A REALLY KEY THEME THAT WILL COME UP SEVERAL TIMES INTO DAY'S PODCAST WHICH IS THAT THERE ARE BOTH MECHANICAL AND CHEMI CAL APPROACHES TO SLOWING AND REVERSING HAIR LOSS MECHANICAL APPROACHES WOULD BE THINGS AS SIMPLE AS MASAGING THE SCALP BUT MECHANICAL CHANGES TO THE SCALP CAN CAUSE EITHER HAIR LOSS OR FACILITATE HAIR GROWTH THIS IS WHY THINGS LIKE MICRO NEEDLING ARE SO PROMINENT IN THE CONTECTS OF TRYING TO REVERSE HAIR LOSS BUT AGAIN THERE ARE ALSO CHEMICAL APPROACHES TO TRYING TO HALT O REVERSE HAIRLOSS AND THIS RELATES TO THE FACT THAT THE HAIR GROWTH IT SALP IS STRONGLY REGULATED BY HORMONES SUCH AS ASTROGEN FHIROID HORMONE INSOLEN LIKE GROWTH FACTOR AND THAT OTHER HORMONES IN PARTICULAR THE ANDROGENS SO THINGS LIKE TESTASTRONE BUT MAINLY ITS DERIVATIVES LIKE DIHYDROTESTOSTERONE ARE VERY MUCH INVOLVED IN SETTING THE STAGE FOR HAIR GROWTH BY CONTROLLING HOW BIG OR SMALL THAT POOL OF STEMSELLS THAT GIVES RISE TO HAIR GROWTH IS SO IF ANY OF THE TERMS I JUST USE ARE CONFUSING TO YOU DON'T WORRY I WILL MAKE ALL THOSE VERY CLEAR IN A MOMENT IT'S ACTUALLY ALL PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD AND SIMPLE AND SO I'D LIKE TO JUST START BY TALKING ABOUT WHAT HAIR IS HOW IT GROWS WHY IT STOPS GROWING AND WHY HAIR NORMALLY FALLS OUT LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BIOLOGY OF HAIR AND IN DOING SO I ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT STEMSELLS A KEEP IN MIND THAT WHEN YOU HEAR THE WORD STEMSELLS YOU WE LIKE MOST PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THE SORTS OF CELLS THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING INJECTED INTO THEIR FACE TO GET RID OF WRINKLES OR GIVE THEM NEW SKIN OR TO GIVE THEM MORE HAIR IF IT'S INJECT IN THE SCALP OR INTO A JOINT TO REPAIR A JOINT OR MUSCLE THOSE STEMSELLS ARE WHAT WE CALL EXAGENIS STEMSELLS EXOGENISTS MEANING FROM OUTSIDE THE BODY THE STEMSELLS ARE WRE GINGTO TALK ABOUT TO DAY ARE SO CALLED ENDOGENOUS STEMSELLS SELLS THAT WE ALL MAKE THAT CAN GIVE RISE TO OTHER SELLS AND THAT'S REALLY THE DEFINITION OF A STEMSELL STEMSELLS ARE PRESENT IN ALL OF US FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF LIFE SO WHEN SPERM MEATS EGG THAT SELL WHICH WE THINK OF AS THE EGG STARTS TO DUPLICATE IT INCORPORATES THE DEONAE FROM THE SPERM AND THE EG OF COURSE SARS A DUPLICATE AND THEN THOSE CELLS GIVE RISE TOD MORE CELLS AND MORE CELLS AND THE ABILITY OF ALL THOSE CELLS TO REPLICATE AND CRATE MORE CELLS ARE BECAUSE THOSE SELLS REALLY ARE STEMCELLS NOW AT SOME POINT WE ARE A COMPLETED BODY PLAN AS THE BIOLOGIST SAY WE END UP WITH A BRAIN AND A SPINAL CORD AND LIMBS AND FINGERS AND LIVERS AND GUTS AND ALL THE THINGS THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO BE OF FUNCTIONING HUMAN BEING EVEN THOUGH WE'RE A BABY AT THAT TIME WE HAVING GROWN UP WE HAVE ALL THE BITS THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FOR OUR ENTIRE LIFE AT THAT POINT MANY OF THE STEMCELL POPULATIONS DISAPPEAR FOR INSTANCE PAST PUBERTY AND PROBABLY EARLIER YOU DON'T GET MANY MORE NEW BRAINCELLS YOU GET A FEW BUT YOU DON'T GET MANY MORE NEW BRAINCLLS BECAUSE THE BRAIN DOESN'T HAVE MANY STEMCELL POPULATIONS WHEREAS OTHER ORGANS IN YOUR BODY MAINTAIN LITTLE POCKETS OF STEMCELLS OR IN SOME CASES MANY MANY STEMCELLS THAT CAN GIVE RISE TO MORE AND MORE OF THAT TISSUE ACROSS THE LIFE SPIN AND HAIR IS ONE SUCH TISSUE SO IF WE TAKE A LOOK AT HAIR WHAT WE FIND IS THAT INDEED THERE ARE THSE THINGS WE CALL HAIRS BUT THERE ARE ALSO STEMCELLS AND THOSE STEMCELLS ARE ACTUALLY WHAT GIVE RISE TO THE HAIRS THAT WE SEE ON THE HEAD OF OUR SCALP OR THAT WE SEE ON THE SURFACE OF OUR BODY SO RIGHT OFF THE BAT YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT EVERY SINGLE HAIR THAT YOU HAVE IS THER BECAUSE YOU HAVE A STEMCELL POPULATION THAT IS GIVING RISE TO THAT PARTICULAR HAIR SO LET'S TAKE A STEP BACK OR RATHER I SHOULD SAY LET'S ZUMIN ON ONE HAIR AND THE STEMSELL POPULATION THAT GIVES RISE TO THAT HAIR BECAUSE IN DOING SO YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN ALL THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS THAT YOU CAN TAP INTO IF YOUR GOAL IS TO HALT THE LOSS OF HAIRS OR TO REPLACE HAIRS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN LOST AS SO IF WE WERE TO JUST ZUMIND AT THE LEVEL OF ONE HAIR WHAT YOU WOULD FIND IS THAT THAT HAIR HAS WHAT TYPICALLY IS CALLED A HAIR ROOT SO THAT'S THE PORTION BELOW THE SKIN AND WHEN WE SAY BELOW THE SKIN IT MEANS THAT IT DIVES DOWN INTO A NARROW TRENCH WHICH IS IN THIS SI'LL ALLE EPIDERMIS WHICH IS THIS OUTER LAYER OF SKIN IT ALSO HAS A SHAFT THE SHAFT IS THE PART THAT GROWS OUT ABOVE THE SKIN SO WHAT YOU SEE ON SOMEBODY'S HEAD OR YOU SEE ON THE ON THEIR ARM OR WHEN YOU SEE AN EYEBROW YOU'RE SEEING THE SHAFT OF THE HAIR THE ROOT OF COURSE GOES BELOW THE SKIN WHAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE HOWEVER IS THAT DOWN AT THE BASE OF THE ROOT THERE'S ASHY A LITTLE CAVE A LITTLE POCKET SO IF YOU ARE TO LOOK AT THIS IT WOULD LOOK LIKE A LITTLE BOWL THE LITTLE ROUND AREA WITH A BUNCH OF STUFF IN IT RIGHT BELOW THE ROOT AND WITHIN THAT LITTLE CAVE THERE ARE STEMCELLS THERE ARE POPULATIONS OF CELLS THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO DIVIDE WE CALL THIS MITOSIS IT'S A PROCESS BY WHICH CELLS CAN ACTUALLY DIVIDE AND TAKE DIENE WITH THEM AND THEN GIVE RISE TO OTHER CELLS WE CALL THOSE CELLS THAT THAT DIVIDE AND MOVE OUT WE CALL THOSE DOTTER CELLS WE CALL THE CELLS THAT GIVE RISE THEM PROGENITOR CELLS BT THEY ARE EFFECTIVELY STEMCELLS THAT GIVE RISE TO THESE WHAT WE CALL DOTTER CELLS THOSE DOTTER CELLS THEN BECOME THE VARIOUS TYPES OF CELLS THAT MAKE UP THE HAIR SO WHEN YOU SEE A HAIR YOU'RE NOT SEEING SOMETHING THAT GROWS THROUGHOUT THE LIFE SPIN YOU'RE SEEING SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE BORN DOWN THERE IN THAT LITTLE CAVE THEN IS GOING TO GROW IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO STACK UP ON TOP OF IT CELF THAT'S BECAUSE HAIRS ARE MADE UP OF A PROTINE CALLED CARITON THER BUNCH OF IFERENT KINDS OF CARITANS DEPENDING ON WHAT KIND OF HAIR YOU'RE LOOKING AT BUT THESE ARE LITTLE PROACHINGS THAT STACK UP ON TOP OF ONE ANOTHER AND THERE STRUCTURED IN A WAY THAT MAKES THEM PRETTY DARN DURABLE I MEAN IT IT'S POSSIBLE OF COURSE TO PULL A HAIR OUT BUT IF YOU EVER TRIED TO TAR A HAIR IN PARTICULAR U THICK HAIR LIKE ONE FROM THE FACE OR EVEN A ONE OFF THE A TOP YOUR HEAD IT'S ACTUALLY A A PRETTY TENCILES STRONG LITTLE THING AND THAT'S BECAUSE CARATINS STACK UP ON TOP OF ONE ANOTHER AND BIND TO ONE ANOTHER WITH A REALLY STRONG BOND SO WHAT YOU END UP WITH IS A BUNCH APPROACHING STACK UP ON TOP OF ONE ANOTHER AND THAT'S THE ACTUAL HAIR C SO WE VE GOT THE HAIR SHAFT THE HAIR ROOT AND THEN WE'VE GOT THE STEMCELLS DOWN THERE IN THAT POCKET THAT GIVE RISE TO THE VERY CELLS THAT MAKE UP THE ACTUAL HAIR WE ALSO HAVE DOWN THERE IN THAT LITTLE CAVE WHICH BY THE WAY IS I SHALLY ALLED THE HAIR BULB IF YOU REALLY WANT ANOTHE TECHNICAL NAME CAUSE IT SHAPED LIKE A BULB WE HAVE NOT JUST STEM CELLS BUT WE HAVE CELLS THAT GIVE RISE TO THE PIGMENT OF THE HAIR THAT CREATE WHAT'S CALLED MELINEN NOW SOME PEOPLE HAVE VERY BLOND HAIR VERY LIGHT HAIR SOME PEOPLE HAVE DARKER HAIR BUT EVERYBODY UNLESS THEY HAVE WHAT'S CALLED THE ALBINOMUTATION WHERE THE HAIRS ARE TRULY WHITE THEY LACK ULL MELINEN AND THIS PRETTY RARE CONDITION ALTHOUGH IT DOES HAPPEN MOST PEOPLE HAVE SOME DEGREE OF MELINEN IN THEIR HAIRS BECAUSE THEIRE LITTLE POCKETS OF MELINEN PRODUCING CELLS MELINENS JUST A PROTINE THAT  SENTURY GETS INJECTED INTO THE CAROTON INTO THE HAIR AND GIVES IT ITS DARKER COLOR NOW THERE ARE COUPLE OTHER COMPONENTS ABOUT THE HAIR THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ESPECIALL IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN REVERSING HAIR LOSS OR REVERSING GRAYING OF HAIR ONE OF THOSE COMPONENTS IS A LITTLE GLAND SO NEXT TO EVERY HAIR ROOT WITHIN THE DERMAL LAYER OF THE SKIN SO THIS IS BELOW THE EPIDERMIS THERE IS A GLAND CALLED THE SABACEOUS GLAND AND THE SABACIOUS GLAN MAKES OILY STUFF IN THE OILY STUFF IS CALLED SEABUM AN UNDR THE NAME SOR OF EVOKES SOMETHING KIND OF GROSS BUT SEBUM IS ACTUALLY REALLY COOL AND REALLY IMPORTANT THE SEEBUM GETS INJECTED OR SEEPS RATHER INTO THE AREA RIGHT AROUND THE HAIR AS THE HAIR STARTS TO APPROACH THE SURFACE WHERE IT GOES FROM ESSENTIAY ROOT TO SHAFT AND THE SEEBUM DOES TWO THINGS FIRST OF ALL IT FORMS A LITTLE BIT OF A SEAL RIGHT AT THE PLACE WHERE THE HAIR EXITS THE SKIN AND THAT SEAL IS VERY IMPORTANT ACTUALLY FOR WATER PROOFING OF YOUR SKIN WE DON'T OFTEN THINK OF OURSELLES AS WATER PROOF BECAUSE WE ARE SO ACCUSTOMED TO WATER JUST LANDING ON OUR SKIN AND AND UM ROLLING OFF BUT THAT'S BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE OILY PROPERTIES OF OUR SKIN NOW IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT OUR SKIN IS PRETTY DENSELY PACKED WITH CELLS BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF SEBUM WE WOULD NOT BE AS WATER PROOF AS WE ARE NOW AS I MENTION SEBUM HAS TWO IMPORTANT PROPERTIES THE OTHER IMPORTANT PROPERTY OF SEBUM IS THAT IT ACTUALLY IS A STRONG ANTI BACTERIAL AND ANTI MICROBIAL MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IS THE OILS OF YOUR SKIN PROVIDE A LOT OF IMMUNE BOUNDARY SO THAT THINGS DON'T GET INTO THE HAIR ROOT OR THE REGION AROUND IT AND INFECT OUR SKIN SO SEBUM WHILE THE NAME IS SORT OF A UNATTRACTIVE TO BE HONEST IS ACTUALLY PERFORMING SOME ESSENTIAL ROLLS BOTH FOR WATER PROOFING AND FOR AREMUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION PROTECTING US FROM VARIOUS KINDS OF INFECTION WE'RE GOING TO RETURN TO SEBUM LATER AS IT TURNS OUT SEBUM IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT AS IT RELATES TO SERIASIS AND AS IT RELATES TO SOME OF THE FUNGLE COMPONENTS THAT CAN CAUSE HAIR LOSS CAN I SO JUST CONFILE THAT AWAY THERE'S ANOTHER IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE REGION AROUND HAIRS WHICH IS THE ERECTOR PILLY MUSCLE THE ERECTOR PILLY MUSCLES IS A MUSCLE THAT LIES DIAGONALLY BETWEEN THAT BULB PORTION OF THE HAIR OR A LITTLE BIT ABOVE IT AD GOES UP TO THE SURFACE OF THE SKIN THE ERECTOR PILLY MUSCLE AS A MUSCLE THAT CONTRACTS WHEN WE GET COLD OR WHEN WE GET SCARED SO IF YOU'VE EVER HAD GOOSE BUMPS THAT'S BECAUSE THE ERECTOR PILLY MUSCLE CONTRACTS PULLING THE SKIN AT THE SURFACE DOWN AROUND THE LITTLE HAIR FOLICLES OR AT LEAST WHERE THE HAIRS MEAT THE THE SURFACE OF THE SKIN AND SO THOSE LITTLE BUMPS ARE ACTUALLY WHERE LITTLE MICRO HAIRS RESIDED AND THE DIMPLES BETWEEN THEM OR THE DIMPLES THAT OCCUR WHEN THIS ERECTOR PILLY MUSCLE PULLS DOWN NOW WHY WOULD THIS MUSCLE EXIST ANDWH T HAS A COUPLE OF IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS ONE OF THE FUNCTIONS IS THAT WHEN IT PULLS DOWN IT CAUSES AS THE NAME SUGGESTS THE HAIRS TO STAND UP MAYBE NOT PERFECTLY VERTICAL BUT THAT WHEN YOU HEREOH I WAS SO FRIGHTEN MY HAIRS STOOD UP ON END THAT'S BECAUSE THE HAIRS BECOME ERECT THEY STAND UP NOW WHY WOULD THIS HAPPEN WHEN WE GET COLD IT HAPPENS BECAUSE WHEN THE HAIRS STAND UP AIR CAN BE TRAPPED BETWEEN THOSE HAIRS AND CAN ACTUALLY WARM OUR BODY THIS IS NOT SO MUCH THE CASE IF YOU HAVE VERY LIGHT HAIR ON YOUR SKIN IF YOU'RE A VERY HAIRY PERSON THIS IS GOING TO BE A MORE ROBUST ASPECT OF YOUR PHYSIOLOGY AND YES THIS IS WHY DOGS LIKE HUSKIES CAN GO OUT IN THE SNOW AND STILL REMAIN WARM WHEN THEY GET COLD THEIR HAIRS ACTUALLY STAND UP A BIT ON END BECAUSE THE CONTRACTION OF THESE ERECTOR PELY MUSCLES TRAPPING AIR IN THERE AND THN THEIR BODY WARMS THE HAIR TRAP BENEATH THE HAIR AND ITS ORE THAY THEY'VE GOT A BLANKET ON MADE BY THE INTERFASE BETWEEN THE HAIR THE AIR AND THEIR SKIN SO JUST TO RECAP ALL THE COMPONENTS OF HAIR AND THE DIFFERENT THINGS AROUND IT THAT ARE GOING T BE RELEVANT FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW TO REPLACE HAIR THAT'S LOST WE HAVE THE HAR ITSELF WHICH HAS THE SHAFT THAT STICKS OUT OVER THE SKIN GOES ALOBIT INTO THE SKIN BUT THEY SEE STICKS OUT OVER THE SKIN WE HAVE THE ROOT PORTION WHICH GOES DOWN INTO THE SKIN GOES THROUGH THE EPIDERMIS AND INTO THE DERMASTEN WE HAVE THIS BULB LIKE REGION DOWN AT THE BOTTOM DOWN AT THE BOTTOM OF THAT BULB WE HAVE STEMCELLS THAT ACTUALLY GIVE RISE TO THE ACTUAL HAIR AND WE HAVE PIGMENTING CELLS THAT PIGMENT THAT HAIR IN ADDITION AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT THERE ARE CAPALARIES THAT GO INTO THAT BULB REGION DOWN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HAIR AND THAT CAN SERVE AND SUPPORT THE STEMCELLS THE MELONIN PRODUCING CELLS WHICH ARE CALED MALANO SITES SO THE MELONIN PRODUCING CELLS IN THE STEMCELLS GET A LOT OF BLOOD FLOW THAT ALLOWS THEM TO KEEP PROVIDING NEW HAIR OR THE PROTINES THAT MAKE UP HAIR AND THE PIGMEN THAT GOES INTO THOSE HAIRS AND THOSE LITE CAPALARIES DELIVER NOT JUST NEUTRIANS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT BUT THEY ALSO DELIVER OXYGEN THESE IT TURNS OUT THAT THE WHOLE PROCESS OF GROWING MORE HAIR IS A VERY ACTIVE PROCESS NOW AS SOON AS YOU HEAR OXYGEN AND YOU HEAR THAT THE GROWTH IS AN ACTIVE PROCESS THAT SHOULD CUE YOU TO WHY SO MANY OF THE STORIES AROUND HOW TO KEEP YOUR HAIR AND REGROW HAIR INVOLVE STAKE MENTS LIKE DON'T WEAR HAT IT'LL MAKE YOUR HAIR FALL OUT OR IF YOU WANT YOUR HAIR TO GROW BACK YAND DON'T WEAR HATS OR MASSAGOR SCALP OR INCREASE BLOOD FLOW OR WHY SOME PEOPLE WILL A SUGGEST THAT PEOPLE TAKE PEPPERMENTOIL FOR INSTANCE OR MENTHALL TYPE OILS OF DIFFERENT KINDS AND MASSAGE THEM INTO THE SCALP THINGS THAT MAKE THE SCALP TINGLE OR THERE WILL BE LIGHT THERAPIES DESIGN TO WHAT TO INCREASE BLOOD FLOW TO THE SCALP THE WHOLE RATIONAL THER IS THAT YOUR TRYING TO INCREASE BLOOD FLOW TO THE STEMCELL AND THE MALANICITE POPULATIONS THAT SUPPORT THE HAIRS AND THAT ACTUALLY CREATE THE HAIRS NOW WHETHE ARENOT THOSE APPROACHES WORK WILL TOUCH ON A LITTLE BIT LATER I'LL JUST GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF A HINT RIGHT NOW WHICH IS THAT WHILE NO SINGLE ONE OF THOSE APPROACHES THAT I DESCRIBED IS KNOWN TO REGROW HAIR IN A VERY ROBUST WAY BECAUSE OF THE REQUIREMENT FOR OXYGEN AND NUTRIENTS AND BECAUSE IT'S SUCH AN ACTIVE PROCESS FOR THE STEMSELLS AND MILANICITES TO GROW AND DARKEN THE HAIRS THEY GROW OUT OF YOUR SKIN IT IS TRUE THAT MANIPULATIONS OR TREATMENTS THAT INCREASE BLOOD FLOW TO THOSE REGIONS CAN AT LEAST SLOW THE LOSS OF HAIR OR CAN EVEN EXTEND THE DURATION OVER WHICH HAIRS CONTINUE TO GROW SO IF YOU'VE HEARD THINGS LIKE DON'T WEAR HAT IF YOU WANT TO MAINTAIN YOUR HAIR OR MASSAGEOUR SCALP IF YOU WANT YOUR HAIR TO GROW FASTER IN SOME SENSE THAT'S TRUE BUT NONE OF THOSE MANIPULATIONS ON THEIR OWN IS GOING TO ROBUSTLY ENHANCE THE RATE OF YOUR HAIR GROWTH THOSE THINGS ARE DESIGN TO BE DONE IN CONJUNCTION WITH SOME OTHER TREATMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN IN MANY MANY CLINICAL STUDIES TO INCREASE THE RATE AND DURATION OF HAIR GROWTH SO NOW YOU HAVE IN MIND A PICTURE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE LEVEL OF INDIVIDUAL HAIRS AND YOU'RE ANYTHING LIKE ME YOUR POBLY THING WHILE THERE'S A LOT GOING ON DOWN THERE JUST PEN ET LOW THE SURFACE OF THE SKIN AND INDEED THERE IS BUT REALY THE THINGS TO THINK ABOUT OR THAT STEMSELL POPULATION THAT ACTUALLY GIVE RISE TO THE HAIR PROTINES SO THAT SHOUL CREATE THE HAIR THE MALANICITES THAT DARKEN THAT HAIR THAT GIVE IT PIG MENT THAT SABACIOUS GLAND AND THE OIL SEABUM THAT PROVIDES SOME IMPORTANT ANTIMACCROBIAL AND OTHER PROPERTIES TO THAT GENERAL REGION AND THAT ERECTOR PILY MUSCLE THAT ERECT OR PILLY MUSCLE THI MENTIONED EARLIER IS IMPORTANT FOR CREATING GOOSE BUMPS AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR KEEPING HUSKIES WARM IN COLD ENVIRONMENTS BUT IT'S DOING SOME OTHER REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS AS WELL AN WILL TALK ABOUT THOSE AS TIME GOES ON THIS EPISODE RIGHT NOW WHAT I WANT TO DO IS JUST TALK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT HOW HAIRS ACTUALLY GROW AND WHY THEY GROW THE WAY THEY DO THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TOWARD UNDERSTANDING HAIR REPLACEMENT AND SLOWING HAIR LOSS THERE THREE BASIC PHASES OF GROWTH OF A HAIR THE FIRST PHASE IS THE PHASE IN WHICH THE STEM CELLS DOWN IN THAT BULB GIVE RISE TO THE CELLS THAT MAKE UP THE PROTINES OF THE HAIR SO THE ACTUAL GROWTH OF THE HAIR AND KEEP IN MIND THAT THE HAIR IS ACTUALLY GROWING FROM THE BOTTOM UP NOW YOU MIGHT THINK OF COURSE IT'S GOWING FROM THE BOTTOM OF EVERYONE KNOWS THAT BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT THE HAIR STARTS GROWING RIGHT AT THE SURFACE OF THE SKIN THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT WORKS THE HAIR IS ACTALLY GROWING FROM DEEP WITHIN THE ROOT AND STACKING UP AND THEN EVENTUALLY EXTENDS OUT ACROSS THE TOP OF THE SKIN THAT GROWTH PHASE IS CALLED THE ANAGIN PHASE A AN A G E N AND THIS FOR SOME PEOPLE WILL RING A BELL BECAUSE IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN INTERESTED IN WEIGHT LIFTING OR EVEN IF YOU'RE AN ENDURANCE RUNNER YOU'LL HEREABOUT THINGS THAT ARE ANABOLIC THAT PROMOTE GROWTH SO ANA OF GROWTH OR CATABOLIC THAT PROMOTE BREAKDOWN SO THE FIRST PHASE OF HAIR GROWTH IS CALLED THE ANAGN PHASE AND IT'S A PERIOD OF VARYING DURATION DEPENDING ON WHICH HAIR IN THE BODY WERE TALKING ABOUT SO THE ANAGIN OR THE GROWTH PHASE FOR HAIRS ON THE HEAD AS I MENTIONED EARLIER IS ANYWHERE FROM TWO TO EIGHT YEARS FOR MOST PEOPLE IT'S GOING TO BE ABOUT SIX YEARS WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT IF WE WERE O JUST NOT CUT OUR HAIR JUST LET OUR HAIR GROW FOR TO TO EIGHT YEARS THAT HAIR WOULD EVENTUALLY GROW TO A LENGTH THAT IT WAS AT ITS MAXIMUM AND THEN WOULD STOP GROWING SO WE CAN SAY THAT THE ANAGN PHASE OF HAIRS ON THE SCALP IS TWO TO EIGHT YEARS THE DURATION OF THE GROWTH FASE CONTRASTS THAT FOR INSTANCE WITH THE DURATION OF THE ANAGEN PHASE FOR HAIRS OF THE EYEBROWS THE HAIRS OF THE EYEBROWS GROW ABOUT FOUR POINT TWO MILLIMETERS PER MONTH BELIEVEUARE NOT PEOPLE HAVE MEASURED THE SORT OF THING NOW THAT'S AN AVERAGE SO SOME PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE EYEBROWS THAT A'M GROW MUCH LONGER PER MONTH II'M SOMEBODY WHO FOR INSTANCE HAS A MOSTLY THE SAME LENGTH EYEBROW HAIRS WHAT EVERY ONE SOM I'LL GET ONEOF THOSE EYEBROW HAIRS LIKE REALLY SEEMS TO BE HEADING OFF MY HEAD AT LIKE REALLY WANTS OUT OF THERE AND SO IT'S MUCH LONGER THAN THE REST WHAT DOES THAT MEAN DOES IT MEAN THAT IT GREW FASTER MAYBE BUT CHANCES ARE THE STEMSEL POPULATION IN THAT PARTICULAR EYEBROW FOLICAL FOR THAT ONE EYEBROW HAIR IS LONGER THAN IT IS FOR THE OTHERS THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT I'M TRYINGTO ILLUSTRATE TWO PRINCIPLES AT ONCE HERE THE FIRST PRINCIPLE IS THAT DIFFERENT HAIRS ON YOUR BODY INCLUDING THE AIRS ON YOUR SCALP HAVE A GROWTH FASE OF DIFFERENT DURATION THIS IS WHY THE HAIRS ON YOUR HEAD CAN GROW VERY VERY LONG CAUSE THEY HAVE A VERY LONG ANAGEN OR GROWTH PHASE AND THE HAIRS ON YOUR EYEBROWS WILL ONLY GROW FOR A FEW MONTHS BEFORE THEY ACTUALLY FALL OUT AND THEN HAVE TO UNDERGOW REPLICATION OF THE STEMSELVES TO GIVE YOU NEW EYEBROW HAIR TO THEN GROW WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE IS NOT JUST THAT THERER DIFFERENCE IS IN THE DURATION OF THE GROWTH PHASE BUT RATHER THAT THE RATE OF HAIR GROWTH IS NOT SOMETHING THAT TENDS TO DIFFER WITHIN A GIVEN BODY REGION RIGHT YOU'LL HEAR PEOPLE SAY ON MY HAIR GROWS REALLY REALLY FAST OTHER PEOPLE WILL SAY OH MY HAIR GROWS REALLY REALLY SLOWLY THAT IS PROBABLY NOT THE CASE WHILE THERE COULD BE SLIGHT IN RANCES IN THE RATE OF GROWTH THAT IS THE EDDITION OF MORE CARITON TO THE ACTUAL HAIRS SO CREATION OF MORE HAIR MORE QUICKLY ALMOST CERTAINLY WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THAT THE DURATION OF THE ANAGEN PHASE IN SOME PEOPLE IS JUST MUCH LONGER THAN IT ISE IN OTHER PEOPLE AND WE DON'T REALIZE THIS AND WE TEND TO THINK MORE IN TERMS OF HOW FAST HAIR GROWS BECAUSE IF YOU WERE TO JUST LOOK AT SOMEBODY'S HAIR YOU'D SAY OH YOU KNOW THEY'RE ALL MORE OR LESS THE SAME LENGTH I MEAN SOME PEOPLE'S BANGS ARE SHORTER THAN THE BACK BECAUSE THEY CUT THEM BUT IF THEY WERE JUEST GROW THEIR AIR YOU'D SAY OH IT'S ALL MORE LESS THE SAME LENGTH BUT IF WE WERE TO ZUMIN WITH A MICROSCOPE WE WOULD SEE THAT THEIRE A LOT OF HAIRS DOWN THERE IN BETWEEN THE OTHER HAIRS THAT ARE VERY VERY SHORT OR EVEN TINY TINY TINY AND THOSE ARE COMING IN AS THE OTHER ONES ARE FINISHING THEIR ANAGEN PHASE OK SO THAT'S THE ANAGEN OR GROWTH PHASE AFTER THE ENAGEN PHASE COMES THE CATAGEN PHASE AGAIN THIS RESEMBLES THE WORD CATABOLIC OR THE BREAKDOWN PHASE DURING THE CATAGEN PHASE THE HAIR IS ACTUALLY RECEDING NOT FROM THE TOP DOWN TO THE SKIN SURFACE AND THEN INTO THE ROOT BUT THE OTHER WAY IT'S ACTUALLY RECEDING FROM THAT BULBEREGION UP TOWARD THE SURFACE AND THAT CATAGEN PHASE IS GOING TO ALSO BE OF DIFFERENT DURATION DEPENDING ON WHICH AIERY THE BODIERIN AND IT WILL VARY A LITTLE BIT DEPENDING ON WHO YOU ARE MEANING FROM PERSON A PERSON WEILL TALK ABOUT THE INFLUENCES ON THE ENAGENIN CATAGEN PHSE IN A MOMENT WHYS IT IMPORTANT THAT IT ACTUALLY RECEDES FROM THE INSIDE OUT WELL THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS IT DOES THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY A CHANGE IN THAT BULB REGION DOWN BELOW BECAUSE NORMALLY THERE'S AN INTERPHASE THERE'S CONVERSATION THAT'S OCCURRING BETWEEN THE STEMSEL POPULATION THE MALANACIDES IN THE HAIR ITSELF AND THEY SUPPORT EACH OTHER REMEMBER THEREIS BLOOD VESSELS GOING INTO THAT AREA OR RATHER CAPALLARIES THAT ARE FEEDING THAT AREA AS WELL AFTER THE CATAGEN PHASE COMES THE TELIGN PHASE WHICH MEANS REST THE TLIGENPHASE IS APPEARIED IN WHICH NO NEW HAIR PROTINES ARE BEING ADDED BY THOSE STEMSELVES AND DURI ING THAT TILOGEN PHASE THAT BULB DOWN THERE AT THE BOTTOM INSTEAD OF BEING NICE AND OVALIN AND A REALLY HAVING A LOT OF SPACE IN IT WITH ALL TESE DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE STEMCELLS STARTS TO PINCH OFF FROM THE FROM THE LITTLE TUBE THAT COMES DOWN FROM THE SURFACE OF THE SKIN THAT NORMALLY WOULD HAVE A HAIR IN IT IT STARTS THE PINCH OFF AND AT SOME POINT MANY HAIRFOLICLES PINCH OFF THAT BULB REGION AND IT RECEDES AND DIES AND WHEN IT RECEDES AND DIES THE STEMSELL POPULATION IN THE MALANACYTES GO WITH IT IN OTHER WORDS THERE IS NO LONGER A POPULATION OF STEMCELLS TO GIVE RISE TO MORE HAIR AFTER THAT TILLOGEN PHASE AND THERE'S NO LONGER MALANACYTES TO PIGMEN THE HAIR AND IN FACT THE HAIR ISN'T THERE ANY MORE SO THERE'S NO HAIR EVEN TO PIGMENT AFTER THAT TLOGEN PHASE UNLESS IT'S A HAIR OF A PARTICULAR TYPE SUCH AS THE HAIR ON YOUR SCALP WHICH CAN THEN RE ENTER THE CELL CYCLE AND GET BACK INTO AN ANAGEN PHASE AND REGROW MORE HAIR FROM STEMCELLS AND SO THERE ARE THREE CRITICAL STAGES OF THE LIFE CYCLE OF A HAIR THAT ARE RELEVANT TO TO DAY'S CONVERSATION THERE'S THE ANAGEN PHASE DURING WHICH THE HAIR GROWS THERE'S THE CATTAGEN PHASE DURING WHICH THE HAIR ACTUALLY STARTS TO RECEDE AND DIE THE PROTINS ACTUALLY DISAPPEARING FROM THE BOTTOM UP AND THEN WE HAVE THE TILLOGEN PHASE WHICH IS THE PHASE IN WHICH THE STEMSEL POPULATION IS WHAT'S CALLED A SEMI QUIESCENT SEMI QUIET OR COMPLETELY QUIESCENT WHERE ITIS NOT ACTIVE AT ALL THOSE THREE PHASES MAKE UP THE LIFE CYCLE OF A HAIR KEEPING IN MIND THAT FOR SOME HAIRS THEY CAN RE ENTER THE LIFE CYCLE AND GO BACK INTO THE ANAGEN PHASE IF THERE'S STEMSELLS THERE AND IF THERE IS OXYGEN THERE AND IF THERE IS SUFFICIENT BLOOD SUPPORT AND AND THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT AND IF THERE ARE THE APPROPRIATE HORMONAL SIGNALS TO SUPPORT GROWTH AND THERE IS A REDUCTION OR IN ABSENCE IN THE HORMON SIGNALS THAT ACTUALLY TRIGGER THAT TILLIGEN PHASE I MAKE THIS POINT NOW BECAUSE MUCH OF THE REST OF TO DAY'S DISCUSSION IS GOING TO FOCUS ON WHY PARTICULAR HORMONES SUCH AS DIHYDRA TESTOSTRONE CAUS HAIR LOSS AND WHY INHIBITING THINGS LIKE DIHYDRO TESTOSTRONE CAN SUPPORT THE PRESERVATION OF HAIR THAT YOU HAVE AND THE REGROWTH OF HAIR AD TO MAKE A LONG STORY VERY SHORT AND THEN WE'LL GET INTO SOME ADDITIONAL DETAILS THAT ARE RELEVANT AN THAT I HOPE YOU'LL STICK AROUND TO LISTEN TO DIHYDROTESTOSTRONE WHICH IS DERIVITOF OF TESTOSTRONE CAUSES CHANGES IN THAT BOLB REGION WHERE THE STEMSELLS RESIDE IT SHORTENS OR HALTS THE ENEGEN PHASE OF HAIR GROWTH AND IT EXTENDS AND PROMOTES THE CATEGEN AND TELOGEN PHASE SO WHEN WE HEAR THAT O UNOT DIADROTESTOSTRONE MAKES YOUR HAIR FALL OUT OR ESTROGEN MAKES YOUR HAIR GROW THERE ARE REAL CHEMICAL ARE WHICH IS A BIOCHEMICAL LEGITIMATE REASONS AS TO WHY THAT IS BUT IT ALL COMES BACK TO THIS THREE PHASES OF HAIR GROWTH THE ENERGEN GROWTH PHASE THE CATEGEN CATABOLIC OR HAIR LOSPHASE AND THE TELOGEN PHASE WHICH IS A REST PERIOD IN WHICH THE A HAIRS CAN EITHER COME BACK IF IT RE ENTERS THE ENEGENPHASE OR MAYBE ITS OVER FOR GOOD HORMONES OR THE ACCELERATOR AND THE BREAK ON EACH ONE OF THOSE PHASES I'D LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE OF OUR SPONSORS ATHLETIC GREENS ATHLETIC GREENS NOW CALLED A G ONE IS A VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT COVERS ALL OF YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEENS I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND IN TWELVE SO ME DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THE REASON I STARTY TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS AND THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIC GREENS ONCE ARE USUALLY TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT GETS BE THE PROBIOTICS THAT I NEED FOR GOT HEALTH OUR GOT IS VERY IMPORTANT ATS POPULATED BY GUP MICROBIODA THAT COMMUNICATE WITH THE BRAIN THE MMUN SYSTEM AND BASICALLY ALL THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OF OUR BODY TO STRONGLY IMPACT OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM HEALTH AND THOSE PROBOTICS AN ATHLETIC GREENS ARE OPTIMAL AND VITAL FOR MICROBIOTIC HEALTH IN ADDITION ATHLETIC GREENS CONTAIN A NUMBER OF ADAPTIGENS VIEMENTS AND MINERALS THAT MAKE SURE THAT ALL F MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS ARE MET AND IT TASTES GRIGPT IF YOU' LIKE TO TRY ATH LETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS THAT MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO MIX UP ATHLETIC GREENS WHILE YOU'RE ON THE ROAD IN THE CAR ON THE PLAN ET CETERA AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THREE K TOO AGAIN THAT'S ATHLETIC GREN SDOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET THE FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEARS SUPPLY A VITEMIND THREE K TO SO NOW YOU HAVE IN MIND THE ANATOMY OF THE HAIR AND THE AREA FROM WHICH IT GROWS AND THE STEMSELLS ET CETERA FACT THAT THERE'S CAPLARY INERVATION DELIVERING OXYGEN AND BLOOD FLOW TO THE STEM SELLS THAT GIVE RISE TO THE HAIR AND THAT THERE ARE THESE THREE CRITICAL PHASES OF HAIR GROWTH ANAGEN CATEGEN TULOGEN NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT THE EXCELERATORS ON HAIR GROWTH AND THE BREAKS ON HAIR GROWTH THERE ARE MANY ACCELERATORS ON HAIR GROWTH BUT THE FIRST ONE THAT I REALLY WANT TO UNDER SCORE IS BLOOD FLOW ITSELF WHICH EQUATES TO THE DELIVERY OF NEUTREENTE AND OXYGEN THIS IS VARY IMPORTANT AND IT EXPLAINS THE LOT OF THE TREATMENTS FOR HALTING AND REVERSING HAIR LOSS FOR INSTANCE ONE OF THE LONGEST STANDING TREATMENTS FOR HALTING AND REVERSING HAIR LOSS IS SO CALLED MANOXODIL MINOXODILS SOMETIMES ALSO REFERRED TO BY THE BRANDNAME ROGAIN WAS ACTUALY A DRUG THAT WAS DEVELOPED TO TREAT HYPERTENSION SO THIS IS A CARDIAC GROG THAT LOWERS BLOOD PRESSURE AND IT DOES THAT BY CAUSING VASO DILATION IT ALLOWS MORE BLOOD FLOW NOXIOUS TO THE HAIRS ON YOUR SCALP BUT TO HAIRS EVERYWHERE ON YOUR BODY AND INDEED MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZES BUT MONOXODIL WON'T JUST SLOW THE LOSS OF HAIR FROM YOUR SCALP IT IS ALSO EFFECTIVE AT SLOWING THE LOSS OF HAIR ELSEWHERE IN YOUR BODY HOW DOES IT DO THAT WELL YOU NOW KNOW ONE OF THE MAJOR WAYS IT DOES THAT IT DOES THAT BY EXTENDING THE ANAGEN PHASE OH IT BASICLLY MAKES THAT PHASE A BIT LONGER DOES IT MAKE IT MUCH MUCH LONGER WHICH IS WHY FOR MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE LOSING THEIR HAIR QUICKLY OR WHO HAVE ALREADY LOST THEIR HAIR MONOXDIL ALONE IS NOT GOING TO BE SUFFICIENT TREATMENT HOWEVER MONOXYDIL HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE AT SLOWING RATES OF HAIR LOSS AND PEOPLE THAT ARE STARTING TO EXPERIENCE SOM HAIR LOSS ALL GET INTO DOSAGES AND THINGS OF THAT SORT ELOBIT LATER BUT RIGHT NOW I JUST WANT OF REALLY FOCUS ON THE LOGIC OF WHY PEOPLE WOULD TAKE THIS DRUG WHICH IS LOWERING HY PROTENSION AT ALL AS IT RELATES TO HAIR LOSS RIGHT THAT MIT SEEMLING CON OF CRAZY UNTIL YOU UNDERSTAND THE ANATOMY AND THE GROWTH OF HAIRS WHICH YOU NOW DO SO THAT'S WHAT MONOXYDIL IS DOING IT'S CREATING MORE BLOOD FLOW TO THE HAIRS WHICH BECAUS MONOXYDIL DOES HAVE THIS POSIVE EFFECT LEAST MOST PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO SLOW THEIR RATES OF HAIRLOSS ON THEIR SCALP ANYWAY IT TELLS YOU THAT BLOOD FLOW AND DELIVERY OF OXYGEN AND OTHER NUTRIENCS FROM THE BLOOD IS PRETTY CRITICAL IF NOT VERY CRITICAL FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE HAIR GROWTH CYCLE ITSELF NOW AGAIN WE HAVEN'T TALKED AT ALL ABOUT THE SORTS OF CHEMICALS OR THE SIGNALS WITHIN THE BODY SUCH AS HORMONES THAT ACTUALLY DIRECT THE GROWTH OF HAIRS HERE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT A MECHANICAL CHANGE ALLOW MORE BLOOD FLOW TO THE REGION AND THEREBY EXTEND THE ANAGEN FASE WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS WITH MONOXYDIL NOW MONOXYDIL DOES HAVE OTHER EFFECTS AND THIS IS WHY DOSING OF MONOXYDIL BECOMES A LITTLE BIT COMPLICATED AND CAN BE ELOBIT TRICKY TO TROUBLE SHOOT IT CAN GREATLY LOWER BLOOD PRESSURE OR LOWER BLOOD PRESSURE JUST A LITTLE BIT DEPENDING ON HOW SENSITIVE SOMEBODY IS TO THAT PARTICULAR DRUG SO OFTENTIMES PHYSICIANS WILL START PEOPLE ON MONOXYDIL DOSAGES THAT ARE VERY LOW IDEALLY THAT WOULD BE THE CASE AND THEN RACHETED UP IN ORDER TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE MINIMAL EFFECTIVE DOSE O THE KIND OF CRITICAL THRESHOLD IS BEYOND WHICH THEY START EXPERIENCING SOME PRETTY UNCOMFORTABLE SIDE EFFECTS SUCH AS O SWELLING OF THE ANKLS OR HEADACHES OR DIZZINESS THESE THINGS CAN'T HAPPEN WITH THE USE OF ROGAN ACH MONOXYDIL NOW MONOXYDIL HAS ALSO BEEN ASSOCIATE WITH INCREASES IN N THE HORMONE PROLACTIN PROLACTIN IS A HORMONE THAT'S RELEASED FROM THE PATUITARY IT IS A HORMONE THAT ACTS ALSO IS A BIT OF A NARROW TRANSMITTER LIKE MANY HORMONES AND IT TENDS TO BE ANTAGONISTIC OR IN OPPOSITE TO DOPOMINE SEDOPOMINE IS A NEUROCHEMICAL WHIT SACTIAN NUROMODULATOR MEANING IT MODULATES THE ACTIVITY OF A BUNCH OF NURAL CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN IT ALSO CONTROLS THE RELEASE OF VARIOUS HORMONES IN THE BODY DOPOMINE IS ALMOST ALWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH STATES OF MOTIVATION PURSUIT AND DRIVE IT HAS A LITTLE BIT OF A AND AF FEEL GOOD ELEMENT TO IT WHICH IS WHY A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK DOPAMING AS ASSOCIATEO WITH REWARD AND PLEASURE BUT IT'S REALLY ABOUT ENERGY MOTIVATION AND DRIVE DOPOMINE AND PROLACTON ARE AS I MENTION BEFORE ANTAGONISTIC TO ONE OTHER THERE SORT OF A PUSH PULL SO PEOPLE WHO TAKE MONOXIDIL SPECIALL IF THE VERY SENSITIVE TO ITOR THEY TAKE DOSAGES THAT ARE TOO HIGH WILL EXPERIENCE INCREASES IN PROLACTIN THAT IN TURN CAN CAUSE THINGS LIKE REDUCTIONS IN LEBIDO REDUCTIONS IN OVERALL FEELINGS OF WELL BEING APATHY AND IN SOME CASES WHERE THE ELEVATIONS IN PROLACTON ARE MORE EXTREME THEY CAN EXPERIENCE OF FOR INSTANCE INCREASE IN MAL BREAST TISSUE GANA COMASTIA OR EVEN SMALL BITS OF MILK LET DOWN THINGS OF THAT SORT IN WOMEN WHO TAKE MONOXIDIL THI SIDE EFFECTS ARE MUCH LIKE THE ONES IN EXPERIENCED IN MEN SO THERE CAN BE SWELLING EDIMA OF THE TISSUES AN BECAUSE IF YOU GET TOO MUCH VASE OF DILATION AND TO TOO MUCH LOWERING OF BLOOD PRESSURE THAT'S NOT GOOD HEADACHES DIZZINESS AND SO ON SEDOSING O MONOXDIL IS REALLY IMPORTANT IF SOMEBODY'S GOING TO USEMONOXIDIL IN ORDER TO TRY IN SLOW OR REVERSE HAIR LOSS AND AGAIN IT MAINLY IS GOING TO BE USED TO SLOW RATES OF HAIRLOSS NOT TO ACTUALLY REVERSE HAIR LOSS THE REALLY KEYTHING IS TO GET THAT DOS A DRY SO THE RANGES OF MONOXIDIL THAT YOU'LL SEE SUGGESTED AND THAT PEOPLE USE OUT THERE ARE VAST AND I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THAT THEIRE TOO MAJOR ROUTES BY WHICH PEOPLE GET MONOXIDIL TO THE HEIRPOLICAL ONE IS TO TAKE IT SYSTEMICALLY AS A PILL WHERE GOES INTO THE GENERAL CIRCULATION THE OTHER IS TO TAKE IT TOPICALLY AS A CREAM THERE ARE PRESCRIPTION AND NONPRESCRIPTION FORMS OF MINOXIDIL JUST A FURTHER COMPLICATE THINGS BUT THE RANGES OF ORAL MONOXIL THAT YOU'LL SEE OUT THERE AND THAT PEOPLE TAKE RANGE ANYWHERE FROM ZERO POINT TO FIVE MILIGRAMS ALL THE WAY UP TO FIVE MILIGRAMS PER DAY SO THAT'S AN ENORMOUS RANGE IS AKE A TWENTYFOLD RANGE THE TOPICAL MONOXIDIL IS ALSO FOUND IN VARIOUS CONCENTRATIONS THE TYPICAL CONCENTRATION IS GOING TO BE A FIVE PER CENT CONCENTRATION THAT PEOPLE USE ONCE PER DAY TOPICAL TREATMENT WITH MONOXIDIL AT FIVE PER CENT CONCENTRATION IS THOUGHT TO JUST STAY AT THE SCALP BUT WE NOW KNOW THAT IT CAN GO SYSTEMICALLY CAN GET INTO THE GENERAL BLOODSTREAM WHY THAT IS SHOULD MAKE COMPLETE SENSE TO YOU BECAUSE WHEN YOU PUT SOMETHING ON YOUR SCALP I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT HEU'S LITTLE PITS ON THESE LL TUBES THAT GO DOWN TO THOSE BULB REGIONS A BELOW THE SKIN THAT HAVE DIRECT ACCESS TO THE BLOOD SUPPLY SO WHEN YOU MASASH SOMETHING INTO YOUR SCALP IT NOT ONLY HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET INTO YOUR GENERAL CIRCULATION IT OFTEN DOES ESPECIALLY IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S VERY WATER SOLUBLE AND THAT WAY CAN GET INTO THE CAPOLARIES AND INTO THE GENERAL BLOODSTREAM ALTHOUGH TOPICAL TREATMENTS OF WHICH WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS A NUMBER OF THEM TO DAY DON'T TEND TO GET INTO THE GENERAL CIRCULATION AS ROBUSLEY AS TAKING SOMETHING BY WAY OF PILL OR CAPISAL O CASE OF MONOXYDAL WORKS BY WAY OF INCREASING BLOOD FLOW TO THE STEMSEL NICHE BELOW THE HAIR THE DOSAGE RANGES OF THE ORALMONOXIL ARE TREMENDOUS POINT TO FIVE MILIGRAMS ALL THE WAY UP TO FIVE MILIGRAMS ONCE PER DAY THE DOSAGE RANGE OF THE TOPICAL SOLUTIONS TENDS TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE CONFINED TYPICALLIES OF FIVE PER CENT SOLUTION AND IT'S RECOMMENDED AT PEOPLE USE AT ONE TIME DAILY MAY BE TWICE DAILY IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT BY THE WAY IF YOUARE GOING TO TAKE THIS ROUT THAT YOU ACTUALLY LEAVE THAT SOLUTION ON THE SCALP FOR THREE TO FIVE MINUTES THIS IS IMPORTANT AND SHOULD MAKE COMPLETE SENSE AS TO WHY ITS IMPORTANT UCANCIOUS RUB THE STUFF IN YOUR HEAD AND THEN RINTS IT OFF AND EXPECTED TO BE ABSORBED AT ACTIONES TO SEEP DOWN INTO THOSE HAIRFOLICALS AND AXIS THE NICHE HOW DO PEOPLE ARRIVE AT THE CORRECT DOSAGE FOR MONOXIDIL WELL FOR BETTER FOR WORSE REALLY IN SOME CASES IT'S ACCOMPLISHED BY FINDING OUT THAT YOU HAVE AN UNWANTED SIDE EFFECT LIKE DIZZINESS OR SWELLING OF YOUR ANKLES OR EDIMA OR I WOULD HOPE THIS WOULDN' BE THE CASE BUT SOMETHING THAT SUGGEST THEIRE'S HYPER PROLACTONEMIA YOU COULD GET A BLOOD TEST TO MEASURE PROLACTON OR O U PERHAPS NOTICE A DROP IN LEBIDO OR SOME LETHARGY ON THESE SORTS OF THINGS THAT ARE COMMON TO REDUCE LEVELS OF DOPOM AN INCREASE LEVELS OF PROLACTON I WOULD HOPE THAT IF PEOPLE ARE WORKING WITH A PHYSICIAN OR IF THEYRE NOT IN TAKING ANOXIDIL THAT THEY WOULD START WITH THE LOWEST POSSIBLE DOSE SO FOR ORAL MONOXIDIL THAT WOULD BE POINT TO FIVE MILIGRAMS AND THEN INCREASE IT AS NEEDED RATHER THAN JUMPING IN RIGHT AT FIVE MILIGRAMS BECAUSE SOME OF THOSE SIDE EFFECTS IN PARTICULAR THE FLUID RETENSION AND THE HYPEROPROLACTONEMIA CAN BE PRETTY UNCOMFORTABLE AND CAN DESRUPT A LOT OF ASPECTS OF LIFE THAT MOST ALL OF US CONSIDER DESIRABLE O CASE IT WERE REALLY FOCSSING RIGHT NOW ON TREATMENTS THAT RELATE TO THE CRITICAL REQUIREMENT FOR HAIRSTEMSELLS TO RECEIVE BLOOD FLOW IN ORDER TO RECEIVE OXYGEN AND NEUTRIANTS TO GET THE HAIR TO GROW AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT MONOXIDIL IS A BALP IT'S ALSO WHAT ALL OF THOSE ANECDOTES YOU HEAR ARE ALL ABOUT LIKE MASAGING THE SCALP OR PUTTING RED LIGHT ON THE SCALP ALTHOUGH RED LIGHT MIGHT DO SOME OTHER THINGS IN GENERAL HEATING OR LIGHTING OF THE SCALP OR MASAGING OF THE SCALP IS REALLY DESIGNE TO INCREASE BLOOD FLOW TO THE SCALP THE REASON MONOXIDIL WORKS AT ALL IIS BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO INCREASE BLOOD FLOW AROUND THE CLOCK AND THAT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE TAKING A TOPICALLY AND ITS SEEPING INTO THE GENERAL CIRCULATION OR AT LEAST SUSTAINS SOMEWHAT RESTRICTED TO THE HAIRSEL NICHE OR THEIR TAKING OR LY AND IT MAKES IT TO THAT HAIRSELL NICHE A BELOW THE FOLICAL WHEN WE MASAGE OR SCALP HOWEVER THAT'S A TRANSIENT THING YOU I CAN MISSAGE MY SCALPRY NOW I'M NO DOUBT A INCREASING BLOOD FLOW TO CERTAIN AREAS M PRETLY DECREASING BLOOD FLOW TO THE AREASM PUSHING DOWN ON BUT IT'S ALL TEMPORARY I DON'T KNOW MANY PEOPLE THAT CAN MASSAGE THEIR SCALP ENOUGH DURING THE DAY OR LONG ENOUGH DURING THE DAY RATHER THAT IT WOULD SUFFICIENTLY INCREASE BLOOD FLOW WITH THAT SAID IT IS CLEAR THAT INCREASING BLOOD FLOW TO THE SCALP BY WAY OF REDUCING HIGH PRETENSION WHICH IS EFFECTIVELY ACCOMPLISHED BY BROADENING BY EXPANDING THE BLOOD VESSELS AN CAPOLARIES IS IT AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO AT LEAST HOLD ON TO THE HAIR THAT YOU HAVE IS IT GOING TO COMPLETELY HALT HAIR LOSS IF YOU HVE A STRONG GERNETIC BY US TOWARDS HAIR LOSS NO IS IT GOING TO REVERSE HAIR LOSS VERY UNLIKELY THAT IT WILL BUT IT CAN SLOW HAIR LOSS OR EVEN MAINTAIN THE HAIR THAT YOU HAVE SO IF WE WERE TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND ASK OURSELVES WHAT OTHER SORTS OF DRUG TREATNANCE ARE OUT THERE BESIDES MANOXIDIL THAT INCREASE BLOOD FLOW AND THAT MY INCREASE THE RATES OF HAIR GROWTH OR MORE LIKELY INCREASE MAINTENANCE OF HAIR THAT ONE ALREADY HAS BY INCREASING BLOOD FLOW TO THE NICHE AND NOWADAYS THEIRE MORE AND MORE DOCTORS WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH THIS REQUIREMENT FOR BLOOD FLOW UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH MONOXYVILL WORKS AN UNDERSTAND THE VAST DESIRE OUT THERE FOR PEOPLE TO HOLD ON TO THE HIR THEY HAVE AND REGROW HAIR AND THEYRE PROSCRIBING THINGS LIKE LOW DOSE TO DALIFILL SO TWO POINT FIVE MILIGRAM TO FIVE MILIGRAM TO DALIFILL TO DALAFILLE WAS INITIALLY DISCOVERED AS A DRUG TO TREAT PROSTATE HEALTH IT WAS A DRUG THAT WE NOW KNOW CAN INCREASE BLOOD FLOW TOF THE PROSTATE AND THEREBY OFFSET SOME OF THE ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH AN AGING PROSTATE HIGHER DOSES OF TO DALIFILL SOMETIMES ALSO REFER TO AS THE BY ITS BRANDNIME WHICH A SEALUS ARE USED TO TREAT ERECTILE TIS FUNCTION BUT AT THE DOSAGES THAT ARE USED TO INCREASE BLOOD FLOW TO THE PROSTATE AND THAT NOW A NUMBER OF DOCTORS ARE USING TO INCREASE BLOOD FLOW NOT JUST TO THE PROSTRATE BUT TO AL REGIONS OF THE BODY INCLUDING THE SCALP SUCH AS TWO POINT FIVE TO FIVE MELIGRAMS TO DALAPILL SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK DESERVES ATTENTION BECAUSE IT FALLS UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF INCREASING BLOOD FLOW TO THE HAIR DEMSEL NICHE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN HAIR IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT MOST DOCTORS ARE GONG TO BE FAMILIAR WITH AS THE WAY TO REVERSE HAIRLOSS BECAUSE IT WON'T DO THAT BUT THE USE OF LODOS TO DALAPIL TO SLOW RATES OF HAIRLOSS IS VERY MUCH IN A LOGICAL MECHANISTIC SENSE EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE LOGIC OF USING MONOXIDIL TO SLOW RATES OF HEIRLOSS IT'S ALL ABOUT INCREASING BLOOD FLOW TO SUPPORT THE STEMSEL NICHE BELOW THE HERFOLICAL THE CRITICAL REQUIREMENT FOR BLOODFLOW OXYGEN AND NUTRANTS TO THE STEMSEL NICHE IS ALSO WHY YOU HER LOT NOWADAYS ABOUT THE USE OF P R P PLATELET RICH PLASMA FOR TRYING TO OFFSET HAIRLOSS OR EVEN REVERSE HAIRLOSS WE'RE GOING TO DO AN ENTIRE EPISODE ABOUT P R P IT IS PRETTY CONTROVERSIAL IN CERTAIN CIRCLS AND WELL ACCEPTED IN OTHER CIRCLES A COUPLE OF KEYTHINGS TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT P R P FIRST OF ALL IT IS BEING USED IN MULTIBLE TISSUES FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES INDIFFERENT CLENIXS SO FOR INSTANCE BORD CERTIFIED PHYSICIANS IN THE UNITED STATES CANADA AN EUROPE ARE DOING P R P INJECTIONS INTO OVERIES TO TRY AND EXPAND THE NUMBER OF HEALTHY FOLICALS AND EGGS SO THAT PEOPLE CAN CONCEIVE LATER IN LIFE OR EVEN EARLIER IN LIFE IF THEY DON'T HAVE ANY FOLCALS PEOPLE ARE GTTING P R P INJECTIONS INTO THEIR JOINTS IN ORDER TO TRY AND SUPPORT JOINT HEALTH PEOPLE ARE GETTING P R P INJECTIONS INTO JUST ABOUT EVERY TISSUE YOU CAN THINK OF HOWEVER P R P DESPITE WHAT YOU MAY HAVE HEARD IS NOT STEMSELS SOMEBODY TELLS YOU THEIR NJECTING STEMSELLS THERE EITHER OUTSIDE THE U S CANAOR NORTHERN EUROPE OR THEIR INJECTING SOMETHING ELSE SO YOU WANT TO A REALLY LOOK IN TO THAT AND OF THE SAFETY ISSUES THEY ARE ARE THE SUBJECT TOTALLY DESERVING OF AN ENTIRE EPISODE I'M NOT NECESSARILY OPPOSED TO THE A FUTURE OF STEMSELVES AS A TREATMENT BUT KEEP IN MIND THAT STEMSELVES OR SELVES THAT CAN GIVE RISE TO LOTS OF OTHER SELL TYPES AND THEY ARE SELLS THAT DIVIDE AND REPLICATE AND THERE'S A NAME FOR THAT WHEN IT HAPPENS IN THE ADULT BODY WHEN YOU DON'T WANT THAT AND THAT'S CALLED CANCER TUMORS ARE OVER PRODUCTION OF SELLS FROM STEMSELLS WHEN THOSE STEMSELLS ORDINARILY SHOULD BE QUIESCENT C SO KEEP IN MIND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STEMSELVES AND P R P P R P PLATELETLICH PLASMA AGAIN IS LEGAL IN THE U S IN MANY OTHER PLACES BECAUSE IT INVOLVES DRAWING SOMEBODY'S BLOOD SPINNING IT DOWN IN A PARTICULAR SPEED WHICH SEPARATES OUT DIFFERENT COMPONENTS WITHIN THE BLOOD THEN TAKING THE PLATELETS AND REINJECTING THOSE IN A SOLUTION BACK INTO THE PERSONS BODIS SO PLATELET RICH PLASMA OR P R P IS PLALET ENRICHED PLASMA FROM THAT PERSON BUT THE BASIS OF P R P IS REALLY TO INCOURAGE NEUTREENT DELIVERY TO A PARTICULAR REGION IN THE BODY USING SOMEBODY'S OWN PLATELETS BECAUSE THOSE PLATELETS ARE ENRICH FOR VARIOUS NEUTRIANTS SO PEOPLE ARE GETTING P R P INJECTIONS INTO THEIR SCALP THOSE ARE NOT STEMSELL INJECTION SO AS ARE P R P INJECTIONS INTO THE SCALP WITH SOME MODERATE SUCCESS THESE ARE VERY EXPENSIVE TREATMENTS THEY TEND TO BE TRANSIENTLY SUCCESSFUL I'M SURE THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE GOING TO SAY P R P WORK FABULOUSLY WELL FOR ME THAT MAYT BE THE CASE I'M NOT GOING TO DISPUTE THAT AND AM HAPPY FOR YOU ALTHOUGH THERE ARE NOT SUFFICIENT CLINICAL DATA TO SUGGEST P R P AS A TREATMENT RIGHT NOW ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE COST MANY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS MANY MANY TREATMENTS IT'S ALSO THE CASE THAT THE P R PANJECTIONS WHEN THEY WORK MIGHTE WORK FOR REASONS INDEPENDENT OF THE PLATELETS WHEN I MEAN BY THAT WELL SOON WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT A DIFFERENT TYPE OF TREATMENT WHICH IS A MECHANICAL MANIPULATION OF THE HAIR POLICAL TO PRCLY ON THE SCALP THATS TYPICALLY WHERE PEOPLE WANT A REGROW HAIR I DON'T KNOW MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO MAINTAIN OR A ACCELERATE OR REGROW THEIR BACK HAIR FOR INSTANCE THEY MIGHT BE OUT THERE BUT I DON'T THINK THE'RE A LOT OF EM OR THEIR LEG HAIR AFOR THAT MATTER ALMOST ALWAYS ITS GOING TO BE SCALP PAIR AND ONE WAY THAT PEOPLE ARE DOING THAT IS THROUGH MECHANICAL STIMULATION OF THE HAIRPHOLICAL AND THE STEMSEL NICHE USING WHAT'S CALLED MICRO NEEDLING MICRO NEEDLING AS THE NAME SUGGESTS IS TAKING A BUNCH OF LITTLE NEEDLES EITHER IN A LITTLE SCAMP SO LITTLE SQUARE OR NOWADAYS TYPICALLY IT'S A ROLLER LOOKS LIKE A A PAINT ROLLER ACCEPT ITS A GOTTONS OF LITTLE NEEDLES IN ROWS ALL OVER THAT ROLLER THOSE NEEDLES RANGE IN LENGTH FROM HALF A MILLIMETER TO TWO POINT FIVE MILL MILLIMETERS MILLIMETERS AND ONE ROLLS THAT OVER THE SCALP AND IF YOUTHINKING OUCH THAT PROBABLY HURTS INDEED THEY CAN HURT A LITTLE BIT OR A LOT DEPENDING ON THE THICKNESS AND THE LENGTH OF THOSE NEEDLES MICR NEEDLING HAS BEEN SHOWN TO DO TWO THINGS IT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REACTIVATE SEMI QUIECENT POPULATIONS OF STEMSELLS THAT ARE IN THAT TEELOGEN PHASE PUTTING THEM BACK IN ANAGEN PHASE AND THEREBY STIMULATE MORE HAIR GROWTH IT HAS ALSO AND THIS IS I THINK THE BEST USE OF MICRO NEEDLING IT HAS ALSO BEEN SHOWN TO BE A VERY EFFECTIVE AGMENT FOR SOME OF THE HORMONE BASED HAIR REGROWTH TOOLS AND PHARMACOLOGY THAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IN A FEW MINUTES SO MICRO NEEDLING AND PIER P HAVE SOMETHING VERY CRITICAL IN COMMON WHICH IS THE NEEDLE THE ACTUAL INJECTION INTO THE SKIN AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE HEARING THIS AND THINKING WHY WOULD DESRUPTING THE SKIN WITH NEEDLES ACTUALLY SUPPORT HAIR GROWTH OR REGROWTH WOULD THAT JUST DAMAGE THE PHOLICAL THIS GETS INTO SOME OF THE A I THINK INTERESTING IF NOT FASCINATING ASPECTS OF OUR BIOLOGY WHICH IS THAT ALL OF THE CELLS IN OUR BODY REALLY CAN RESPOND TO BOTH CHEMICAL AND MECHANICAL CUES AND WHEN WE HER NEEDLE INJECTED IN THE SKIN WE THINK A THAT MUST JUST BE DAMAGING EVERYTHING CAUSING ALL SORTS OF INFLAMMATION BUT TURNS OUT THAT LOW LEVELS OF INFLAMMATION CAUSE BY THINGS LIKE MICRO NEEDL ING OR P R PE INJECTIONS OR EVEN THE INTRODUCTION OF ANY KIND OF FLUID MY FOR INSTANCE SALING FLUID INJECTED INTO A REGION KAN CAUSE CHANGES IN THE CELLS IN THAT REGION CAUSING FOR INSTANCE STEMSEL POPULATIONS THAT WERE WANING TO REACTIVATE AGAIN CAUSING TILLEGEN PHADES PHOLICALS THAT HAVE MALANOCITES AND STEMCELLS THAT ARE DYING OFF BUT NOT COMPLETELY GONE TO RE ENTER THE CELL CYCLE SO MICRO NEEDLING PROCEDURES P R P INJECTIONS THINGS LIKE MONOXIDIL THEY ALL KIN OF CENTERE ROUND THIS SAME GENERAL THEME OF INCREASING BLOOD FLOW INCREASING OXYGEN DELIVERY OF NEUTRIANS OR IN THE KCASE OF MICRO NEEDLING INCREASING INFLAMMATION JUST ENOUGH AT THAT LOCAL SIHTE THAT CERTAIN CASCADES OF BIOLOGICAL FUNCTION THAT RELATE TO PRELIFERATION OF STEMCELLS OR MAINTENANCE OF STEMCELL POPULATIONS ARE KICKED OFF IT'SO LIKE REMINDING THE CELLS IN THAT AREA THAT THEY NEED TO STAY ALIVE IN ORDER TO REPLENISH WHATEVER IS LOST SO SOMETIMES A WOUND CAN ACTUALLY INDUCE SOME KEALING ALTHOUGH I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE MICRO PART OF MICRO NEEDLING IS ABSOLUTELY KEY AND THIS SHOULD BE OBVIOUS TO YOU WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT SCARS I NON NOW ABOUT YOU BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN A SCAR WITH HAIR GROWING OUT OF IT OR IF THERE WAS IT WAS PRATHRLY ONE HAIR BUT IF YOU'VE EVER SEEN A SCAR FOR IT SOME ONE HAD THEIR APPENDIX OUT OR SOMEONE HAD A BRAIN SURGERY YOU SEE THAT SCAR BECAUSE THERE IS NO HAIR GROWING OUT OF IT SO THE MICRO PORTION OF MICRO NEEDLING IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT CAUSING SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO A TISSUE IN ORDER TO ACUVATE THAT STEMCELL POPULATION WERE TALK ABOUT CAUSING MICRO DAMAGE AND MICRO LEVELS OF INFLAMMATION TO STIMULATE GROWTH FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE INTERESTED IN USING MICRO NEEDLING OR MICRO NEEDLING IN COMMINATION WITH CHEMICAL TREATMENTS LIKE MONOXIDIL OR SOME OF THE OTHER TREATMENTS WILL TALK ABOUT IN A BIT LIKE FANASTERIDE AND KAFENE YES BELIEVE R NOT CAFINE IS BEING USED TO REGROW HAIR VERY INTERESTING GETTIN TO THAT MOMENT BUT IF YOUR INTERESTED IN USING MICRO NEEDLING ALONE OR IN COMBINATION WITH SOME OF THESE OTHER TREATMENTS THERE'S A WONDERFUL REVIEW THAT WAS JUST PUBLISHED THIS LAST YEAR WONDERFUL BECAUSE IT'S VERY COMPREHENSIVE NOT SO WONDERFUL NOT TO THE FAULT OF THE AUTHORS BECAUSE MOST OF THE STUDY IS OUT THERE ON MICREO NEEDLING ARE NOT SUPERB THERE ARE WAYS OF GAUGING THE STRENGTH OF A STUDY MAINLY RELATE TO THEIR DURATION WHETHER NOT THERE WERE CONTROL GROUPS ET CETERA BUT THE REVIEW ITSELF AS EXCELLENT THE TITLE OF THE REVIEW IS MICREO NEEDLING AND ITS USE IN HAIRLOST DISORDERS A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WE WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO THIS IN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS AND THIS REVIEW DID A VERY GOOD JOB OF HIGHLIGHTING BOTH THE STRENGTHS AND DRAWBACKS OF THE VERIOUS STUDIES LOOKING AT MICRO NEEDLING IT ALSO EXPLORED THE USE OF MICRO NEEDLING IN BOTH MEN AND WOMEN AND OF VARIOUS AGES AND IT DOES APPEAR TO BE THE CASE THE MICRO NEEDLING SHOWS SOME POSITIVE BENEFIT IN BOTH MEN AND WOMEN REGARDLESS OF AGE ESPECIALLY WHEN USED IN COMBINATION WITH THE VERIOUS OTHER TREATMENT THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT I WAS ALSO ABLE TO GLEAN FROM THIS REVIEW IN SOME OF THE PAPERS DESCRIBED WITHIN IT THAT NEEDLE LENGTHS OF ABOUT ONE MILLIMETER TO TWO POINT FIVE MILLIMETERS SEEM TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE THEN SHORTER NEEDLE LENGTHS SO IF YOU ARE SCARED OF THE NEEDLES AND THE NEEDLE LENGTHS KEEP IN MIND THAT DONE PROPERLY MICHRO NEEDLING SHOULDN'T BE TOO PAINFUL SOME PEOPLE EXPERIENCE A BIT MORE PAIN THAN OTHERS BUT IT'S NOT CONSIDERED A VERY PAINFUL PRECEDURE IT IS HOWEVER A PRECEDURE THAT CAN CAUSE SOME BLEEDING OF THE SCALP AND THAT BLEEDING O THE SCALP CAN BE VERY APPARENT ESPECIAYIF I'S IN THE FRONT OF THE HEAD I SUPPOSED O ON THE TOP OF THE HEAD AND HIDDEN BY SOME HAIR OR IF YOUARE ALREADY I QUITE BALD IN A GIVEN REGION A SO KEEP THAT IN MIND I SUPPOSE ONE COULD WEAR AHAT OR A WHIG OR SOMETHING THAT SORT IF THEY WERE REALLY SELF CONSCIOUS ABOUT IT BUT THE MICRE NEEDLING ITSELF IS CAUSING A PHYSICAL DISRUPTION TO THE SCALP SOME DEGREE OF BLEEDING INFLAMMATION AND AGAIN ALL OF THAT IS PART OF THE PROCESS BY WHICH MICRO NEEDLING CAN ACTUALLY IMPROVE HAIR GROWTH AND OF COURSE THERE'S HEALING THAT OCCURS OF THE BLEEDING AND THE DAMAGE OF THE PHOLICAL THIS IS A TRANSIENT THING BUT UNDERSTANDING THE COSMATIC IMPLICATIONS IN THE SHORT TERM AS WELL AS IN THE LONG TERM IS CERTAINLY WORTH KNOWING ONE THING THAT'S VERY CLEARS THAT THE COMBINATION OF MICRO NEEDLING AND MONOXYDIL TREATMENT TOGETHER IS FAR MORE EFFECTIVE THAN EITHER OF THOSE TREATMENTS ALONE IN ADDITION THE COMMINATION OF MICRO NEEDLING AND MONOXYDIL HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN RECOVERING WHAT ARE CALLED DEAD ZONES SO THESE ARE REGIONS OF THE SCALP THAT ARE EITHER COMPLETELY BALLD OR MOSTLY BALLD FOR WHICH THERE IS ESSENTIALLY NO STEMSEL POPULATION THERE AND THE COMBINATION OF MONOXYDIL PLUS MICRO NEEDLING IS SOMEHOW ABLE TO RECOVER THOSE STEMSEL POPULATIONS AND ALLOW NEW HAIR TO GROW ALTHOUGH THE GROWTH OF THAT HAIR IN THOSE DEADZONE REGIONS CAN TAKE A VERY LONG TIME THIRTY TO EVEN FIFTY WEEKS NEITHER MONOXYDIL TREATMEN ALONE NOR MICRO NEEDLING ALONE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN RECOVERING THESE SO CALLED DEAD ZONES WHEN THOSE TREATMENTS ARE DONE SEPARATELY SO THIS I WOULD SAYIS A STRONG REASON TO CONSIDER COMBINING MICRO NEEDLING AND MONOXYDIL AS SUPPOSED TO JUST DOING MONOXYDIL OR JUST MICRO NEEDLING I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THAT MONOXYDIL TREATMENT IF YOU PURSUE IT IS LIKELY SOMETHING THAT YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DO FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE IF YOU WANT TO HOLD ON TO THE HAIR GROWTH THAT YOU OBTAIN WITH MONOXYDIL OR IF YOU WANT TO MAINTAIN THE HAIR THAT YOU ARE ALREADY MAINTAINING WITH MONOXYDIL SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN TAKING MONOXYDIL MAINTAINING SOME HAIR GROWTH OR EVEN STIMULATING SOME HAIR GROWTH AND THEN COMING OFF MONOXYDIL BUT MOST EVERYONE WHO GOES ON MONOXYDL HAS TO STAY ON MONOXDIL BECAUSE WHEN THEY CEASE TAKING MONOXYDIL EVEN IF THEY'RE DOING OTHER TREATMENTS THEY LOSE THE HAIR THAT THEY GAINED WITH MONOXYDIL SO THAT IS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION THE DECISION TO GO ON MENOXYDIL IS LIKELY A DECISION TO BE ON MONOXDIL FOR THE REST TOF YOUR LIFE SO AS YOU'RE PROBABLY STRYING TO REALIZE THERE'S A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MECHANICAL STIMULATION OF THE PHOLICAL AND BLOODFLOW BOTH OF WHICH TURN OUT TO BE CRITICAL FOR MAINTAINING HAIR AND FOR STIMULATING HAIR GROWTH NOT SURPRISIN NGLY THEN AN INCREASINGLY COMMON TREATMENT FOR HAIRLOSS IS BOTOC BOTOCS IS THE BRAND NAME FOR WHAT IS OTHERWISE KNOWN AS BOCHELINUM NEROTOCIN WHAT IS BOCHELINUM NEROTOCIN WELL BOCHELINUM NEROTOXINS SOMETIMES JUST CALLED BOCHELINUM FOR SHORT IS A TOXIN THAT'S A BACTEREAL TOCIN THAT SERVES TO CUT THE PROTINE THAT LEADS TO SYNAPTIC VESICAL RELEASE WHAT IN THE WORLD DID I JUST SAY WELL WHEN YOUR NERVE CELLS COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER THEY DO THAT BY WAY OF ELECTRICITY BUT THE ELECTRICITY WITHIN THOSE NERVE CELLS THOSE NURONS TRIGGERS THE RELEASE OF CHEMICALS FROM NURONS INTO THE SCYNAPSLL GAP BETWEEN NURONS AND THE RELEASE OF THOSE CHEMICALS ALLOWS THE NEXT NERON TO BE CHEMICALLY ACTIVE OR IN SOME CASES IT WILL SUPPRESS THE ELECTRIC ELECTIVITY OF THAT NEXT NURON BOCHELINUM NEROTOCXIN SERVES TO CUT A PROTINE PRESENT IN NURONS SO THAT NURONS CANNOT RELEASE THE CHEMICALS THAT CAUSE OTHER NURONS TO BE ACTIVE SO THIS ACTUALLY IS PRETTY SERIOUS IF YOU WERE TO GET BOCHELINUM NEROTOXAN INJECTED INTO YOUR MUSCLE YOU WOULD BE PERALYZE BECAUSE THE NERVES THAT CONTROL CONTRACTION OF THE MUSCLES WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE RELEASE OF THAT CHEMICAL ON TO THE MUSCLE WHICH MAKES IT CONTRACT BOCHELINUM NEROTOCIN IS COMMONLY USED IN WHAT'S CALLED BOTOC BOTOCS IS SOMETHING MOST PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH BECAUSE PEOPLE GET IT INJECTED IN AND AROUND THEIR WRINKLES BECAUSE MANY WRINKLES ARE TRIGGERED BY NOT JUST LOSS OF TENSILE STRENGTH IN THE SKIN BUT RATHER THE NERVES AROUND THE SKIN AND IN THE SKIN AR HYPER CONTRACTED WHICH CAUSES WRINKLES SO FERINC I HAVE CRO'S FEET I LIKE TO THINK THAT'S BECAUSE I'VE LAUGHED A LOT AND SMILE U LOT AND IT'S POBLY ALSO BECAUSE IVE SQUINTED A LOT IN MY LIFETIME I HAVE CROS FEET BECAUSE THE NERVES THERE HAVE PINCH THE SKIN ON EITHER SIDE OF MY EYES AND THAT'S GIVEN ME LITTLE CREASES THERE THAT ARE SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS CRO'S FEET BOTOCS INJECTIONS CAN BE APPLIED TO THE SK ALP IN ORDER TO RELIEVE TENSION OF THE SCALP AND IN HEARING THAT IT SHOULD BE OBVIOUS WYBOTOK AS BEING USED TO TRY IN OFFSET HAIRLOSS IT'S DECREASING THE SQUINTING IF YOU WILL OR THE TENSILE NATURE OF THE SCALP SKIN SO THAT MORE BLOOD FLOW CAN ARRIVE AT THAT STEMSELPHOLICAL AREA SO BOTOCKS TREATMENT TO THE SCALP IS ACTUALLY BECOMING PRETTY COMMON THERE ARE COUPLE REQUIREMENTS WITH THIS BOTOCS TREATMENT FIRST OF ALL HAS TO BE DONE BY SOMEBODY WHOSE REALLY SKILLED THERE ARE NUMEROUS IMAGES ON LINE AND WEBSIDES ON LINE OF SO CALLED BOTOKS FAILS WHERE PEOPLE HAVE GOTTEN TOO MUCH BOTOCKS OR THE INJECTIONS OF BEEN DONE TOO DEEP ER NOT AT THE CORRECT LOCATIONS ON PEOPLE'S FACE OR SCALP THAN IT CAN GIVE THEM DROOPY SCALP OR DROOPY EYES ALL SORTS OF YOF COSMETIC NIGHTMARES CAN OCCUR WITH BOTOCKS THE SECOND THING TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT BOTOCKS DOES EVENTUALLY WEAR OFF THAT BOCHALIN OF NARRATOX AND DOESN'T STICK AROUND FOREVER AND PROVIDED IT'S DONE CORRECTLY AT THE CORRECTDOSAGES IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY KILL THE NURANS THAT CAUSE THAT TENSION OF THE SKIN SO BOTOCS INJECTIONS HAVE TO BE DONE REPEATEDLY THE EFFICACY OF BOTOCKS FOR OFFSETTING HEIRLOSS IS NOT CLEAR THEIR ARN'T A LOT OF LARGE SCALE CLINICAL STUDIES ON THIS JUST YET BUT IT DOES SEEM TO BE AT LEAST ONE REASONABLY SAFE ALTERNATIVE TO THINGS LIKE MONOCKIDIL ALTHOUGH I THINK IF ONE WERE TO JUST WANT TO INCREASE BLOOD FLOW TO THE SCALP THINGS LIKE LODOSE TO DALAFILL WHICH DOESN'T SEEM TO CARRY ANY THE SIDE EFFECTS THAT MONOXIDO CAN CARRY WE TALKED ABOUT THOSSIDE EFFECTS EARLIER THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE THE BETTER ALTERNATIVE BOTOC AS A FAIRLY INVASIVE PROCEDURE BUT SOME PEOPLE OP FOR BOTOC TREATMENT IN FACT THERE IS A CYNDRUM CALLED CUTUS VERTICUS GIRATA SOME OF YOU HAVE PROBABLY SEEN THATS IT'S MORE TYPICAL THAN MEN ALTHOUGH IT DOES OCCUR IN WOMEN IT LITERALLY MEANS A LUMPING OF THE SKIN ON THE SCALP OR GIRI OF THE SCALP AN GYRY OR GYRIS PRETAINS TO THE LATIN WORD KNEE SO IT MEANS BUMP OR KNEE AM AND SO AT ANY TIME YOU HEARTHE WERE GIRA A IN NORO SCIENCE OR N BIOLOGY YOU TALC ABOUT A BUMP SOMETIMES SEE PEOPLE HAVE RIDGES IN THE BACK WHERE IT LOOKS AS IF THE SKIN WAS PUSHED TOGETHER CAN LIKE THE A SHARPAY DOG BUT ON THE SCALP PEOPLE WITH CUTOUS VERTICOUS GIRADA ALMOST ALWAYS EXPERIENCE PATTERN HAIR LOSS NOW PART OF THE REASON FOR THAT IS CUTICOUS VERTICOUS GIRADA IS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH SOME ANDROGEN OR TESTASTRONE RELATED HORMONE ISSUES THAT WILL TALK ABOUT IN A LITTLE BIT BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT RELIEVING SOME OF THOSE GIRADA BY INJECTIONS OF BOTOCKS TO ALLOW THOSE FOLDS TO SIT FLATTER AY IS EFFECTIVE IT CAN LEAD TO LESS OF THOSE GIRI THOSE BUMPS AND CAN IMPROVE HAIR GROWTH IN THOSE REGIONS EVEN IF THOSE PEOPLE DON'T TAKE ON ANY ADDITIONAL TREATMENTS TO ADDRESS THE HORMONE ISSUES  THAT'S REALLY HOW PEOPLE ARRIVED AT THIS UNDERSTANDING THAT BOTOCKS MIGHT BE A GOOD TREATMENT IN GENERAL FOR REDUCING THE AN KIND OF SQUINTING OF THE SCALP O THAT CAN OCCUR AND THE RESULTING HAIR LOSS IN THOSE REGIONS I NOW LIKE TO TURN OUR ATTENTION TO THE CHEMICAL VARIABLES THAT CONTROL THE DURATION F THE GROWTH PHASE OF HAIR THE DURATION OF THAT CATTAGENPHASE WHICH IS WHEN THAT HAIR ESSENTIALLY RECEDES FROM THE INSIDE OUT AND THE QUIESCENTER SEMA QUIESCENT TELOGENT PHASE THERE ARE A COUPLE OF KEY CHEMICAL PLAYERS HERE THAT WE SHOULD ALL BE AWARE OF FIRST OF ALL THE GROWTH FACTOR I G F ONE INSOLENT GROWTH FACTOR ONE WHICH IS PRODUCED BY THE LIVER BUT THAT RECEIVE STIMULATION FROM THE BRAIN AND PETUITARY TO BE RELEASED IS A STRONG REGULATOR OF HAIR GROWTH AND WE CAN THINK OF IT AS THE ACCELERATOR ON HAIR GROWTH SO IT DOES THAT BY EXTENDING THAT ANAGEN OR GROWTH PHASE FOR LONGER IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY SPEED UPGROWTH BUT IT EXTENDS IT FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME IN ADDITION CYCLIC A M P WHICH IS PART OF WHAT'S CALLED A SECOND MESSENGER PATHWAY IN FACT CYCLIC AMPE IS A SECOND MESSENGER IS ALSO A KE PLAYER IN STIMULATING GROWTH OF THE HAIR FOLICAL NOW CYCLIC AMP DOES MANY DIFFERENT THINGS IN MANY DIFFERENT CELL TYPES IN THE BODY IT REALLY ACTS AS THE NAME SUGGESTS AS A MESSENGER BETWEEN SIGNALS THAT ARRIVE AT THE SURFACE OF CELLS AND TRANSMITTING OR CONVEYING THOSE SIGNALS TO THINGS THAT HAPPEN DEEP WITHIN THE CELLS SUCH AS THE TURNING ON AND OFF OF VARIOUS GENES SO WHEN HERE SECOND MESSENGER DON'T LET THAT CONFUSE YOU OR OVERWHELM YOU JUST UNDERSTAND THAT THE WHOLE PROCESS OF GETTING SIGNALS FROM THE OUTSIDE OF CELLS INTO THE CENTER OF CELLS AND CONTROLLING GENE EXPRESSION FOR INSTANCE CAUSING A STEM CELL TO CONTINUE TO GIVE OFF DATTER CELLS ERE CAUSING A HAIR CELL TO CONTINUE GROWING FOR LONGER THAT WHOLE PROCESS IS A BIT LIKE A BUCKET BRIGADE OF HANDING OFF WATER OR A BUCKET FROM ONE A COMPONENT TO THE NAXT ARE ALONG A CHAIN IT'S LIKE AN ASSEMBLY LINE I THING THAT'S PROBABLY THE SIMPLEST WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT SO FOR SAKE OF THIS DISCUSSION I G F ONE IS KNOWN TO INCREASE THE GROWTH OF HAIR BY EXTENDING THAT ANAG IN PHASE AS IS CYCLICA M P SO THOSE ARE GOING TO BE CONSIDERED THE ACCELERATORS AT LEAST IN THIS CONVERSATION THE BREAKS ON HAIR GROWTH ARE GOING TO BE THE THINGS THAT EITHER SHORTEN THE ANAGIN PHASE OR THAT EXTEND THE CATTAGIN PHASE OR THIS QUIESCENT PHASE WHICH IS THE TILLIGEN PHASE AND THE TWO MAJOR BREAKS ON HAIR GROWTH THAT WE WANT TO THINK ABOUT ARE P D E WHICH IS A PHOSPHO DIESTERACE ANY TIME YOU HEARE ACE IT'S LIKELY TO BE AN ENSINME AND T G F BADA TOO SO THIS IS A PARTICULAR GROWTH FACTOR THAT SOMEWHAT COUNTER INTUITIVELY DOESN'T STIMULATE GROWTH IT ACTUALLY STIMULATES LACK OF GROWTH OR SHORTEN'S GROWTH SO WITH ALL OF THAT IN MIND AND PLEASE DO ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO REMEMBER ALL THOSE SPECIFIC TERMS JUST UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE SOME FACTORS LIKE INSELLING GROWH FACTOR ONE THAT ACT AS EXCELERATORS ON GROWTH AND THERE ARE FACTORS THAT ACT AS BREAKS ON GROWTH WE CAN START TO THINK ABOUT WY FOR INSTANCE HALF OF ALL PEOPLE BY AGE FIFTY START TO LOSE THEIR HAIR WELL THEY START TO LOSE THEIR HAIR BECAUSE OF SOMETHING CALLED ANDROGEN RELATED ALOPICIA WHICH TRANSLATED TO ENGLISH MEANS TESTAOSTERON AND TESTOSTERON DERIVETED INDUCED HERLOSS THIS IS TRUE IN MEN AND WOMEN SO HEARING THAT YOU SHOULD PROBABLY BE WONDERING THE FOLLOWING THING YOUNG MEN HAVE HIGHER LEVELS OF TESTOSTERON THAN OLD MEN RIGHT WELL THE ANSWERS YES ALTHOUGH SOME OLDER MEN IN THEIR FORTIES FIFTIES EVEN EIGHTIES MAINTAIN TESTOSTERONE LEVEL SIMILAR TO MANY MEN IN THEIR TWENTIES BUT MOST DON'T IT'S A DOWNWARD SLOPE STARTING AT ABOW AGE FORTY HOW STEEP THAT DOWNWARD SLOPE IS DEPENDS WOMEN TOO HAVE TESTOTRON IN FACT WOMEN HAVE HIGHER LEVELS OF TESTOSTERON THAN THEY DO ESTROGEN THAT'S RIGHT A HEALTHY WOMAN HAVE HIGHER LEVELS OF TESTOSTERON THAN SHE DOES ESTROGEN HOWEVER WOMEN ON AVERAGE HAVE LOWER TESTOSTERON THAN MOST MEN SO THEY STILL HAVE FAR MORE ESTROGEN AND FAR LESS TESTOSTRON THAN MOST MEN BUT THE LEVEL OF TESTASTRN THAT THEY HAVE WITHIN THEIR BODY IS HIGHER THAN THE LEVEL OF ESTROGEN THEY HAVE ANDROGENS SUCH AS TESTOSTERON AND ITS DERIVITIVS SUCH AS DIHYDRO TESTOSTRON WHICH WILL BE MUCH THE TOPIC OF WHAT WE'RE GTTING INTO NEXT IN HIBOT IGIF ONE AND CYCLICE AN P AGAIN ANDROGEN SUCH AS DIHYDRO TESTOSTERON INHIBOT PREVENT THE ACTION OF IGIF ONE AND CYCLICAAN P WHICH YOU JUST LEARNED A FEW MOMENTS AGO ACT TO EXTEND THE ANAGENER GROWTH PHASE OF HAIR WHICH THEN RAISES THE QUESTION WELL IF YOUNG PEOPLE BOTH MALE AND FEMALE HAVE HIGHER LEVELS OF TESTOSTERON THAN THEY DO WHEN THEIR OLDER WHY WOULD PEOPLE LOSE THEIR HAIR WHEN THEIR OLDER AND NOT YOUNGER AH THE ANSWER LIES IN THE CONVERSION OF TESTASTERON TO DIHYDRO TESTOSTRON TESTOSTERON MOST PEOPLE HAVE HEARD OF DIHYDRO TESTOSTRON OR H T IS MADE FROM TESTOSTRON THERE'S AN ENZIME CALLED FIVE ALFORDUCTES THE CONVERTS TESTOSTRONE INTO DIHYDR TESTOSTRONE IN BOTH MEN AND WOMEN DIHYDRA TESTOSTRONE BINDS TO THE ANDROGEN RECEPTOR AT FIVE TIMES THE AFFINITY OF TESTSTRONE SO IT IS THE MOST POWERFUL ANDROGEN IN HUMANS AND IT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WE ALL REALLY WANT AND LIKE SUCH AS MENTAL VIGOR PHYSICAL VIGOR STRENGTH HEALING CAPACITY DRIVE LEBIDO AND ON AND ON SO D H T ITSELF IS NOT BAD SO IF WE TAKE A STEP BACK AND WE ACKNOWLEDGE TESTOSTRONE LEVELS ARE HIGHER IN MALES AND FEMALES AT YOUNGER AGES AS A POS T OLDER BUT AS THEY GET OLDER THERE IS MORE FIVE ALF OR REDUCTAS ACTIVITY WHICH IS CONVERTING MORE OF THAT TESTOSTRON TO DIHYDR TESTOSTRNE AND DIHYDR TESTOSTRONE INHIBITS HAIR GROWTH BY REDUCING IGEIF ONE ENCYCLIC AMP WEL THEN WE SHOULD ALL BE ABOARD WHY IT IS THAT BY GE FIFTY ABOUT FIFTY PER CENT OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCE PATTERN HAIR LOSS THAT IS ANDROGEN DEPENDENT ALOPITIA BUT TRANSLATED TO NORMAL ENGLISH IS PATTERN HAIR LOSS AND IN A MOMENT YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHY SOME PEOPLE LOSE THEIR HAIR FROM THE CROWN REGEN AM IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD OR BACK AND TOP OF THE HEAD WHEREAS OTHER PEOPLE LOSE THEIR HAIR IN THE FRONT OF THEIR HEAD IN THE FLANKS RIGHT ON EITHER SIDE OF THE MIDLINE OR MAY BE IN THE MIDLINE IN FRONT ALTOGETHER AND THAT'S BECAUSE DIFFERENT PEOPLE DEPENDING ON THEIR GENETIC LINEAGE HAVE DIFFERENT PATTERNS OF ANDROGEN RECEPTORS ON THEIR SCALP AND THE PATTERN OF ANDROGEN RECEPTORS THAT YOU INHERIT INDEED DOES COME FROM YOUR MOTHER'S SIDE AND SO THIS IS WHAT GAVE RISE TO THE THE MYTH THAT IF YOU WANT TO KNOW IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO BALD OR NOT JUST LOOK AT YOUR MOTHER'S FATHER DOESN'T QUITE WORK THAT WAY IN FACT IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE LOGIC YOU SHOULD REALLY LOOK AT YOUR MOTHER'S MOTHER IF YOU WANT TO KNOW YOUR PATTERN OF ANDROGEN RESCEPTORS ON YOUR SCALP HOWEVER MOST WOMEN DON'T LOSE AS MUCH HAIR FROM THEIR SCALP OR THEY HAVE WAYS OF COVERING UP THE HAIR LOSS IN THEIR SCALP BECAUSE THEIR HAIR IS JUST GENERALLY LONGER OR THEIRE USING OTHER APPROACHES SO THAT YOU NEVER REALLY GET A CLEAR PICTURE OF WHAT THE ANDROGEN DEPENDENT HAIR LOSS WAS IN YOUR GRANDMOTHER  NOW WE DON'T WANT TO GO TOO FAR DOWN THE GENETIC'S RABBIT HOLE BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T SELECT YOUR PARENTS ANYWAY BUT IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY FOR INSTANCE I'M LOSING A BIT OF HAIR ON EITHER SIDE OF THE MIDDLINE IN THE FRONT IT ALMOST SCERTAINLY HAS TO DO THE FACT THAT I'VE A HIER DENSITY OF ANDROGEN RECEPTORS THERE AS SUPPOSED TO SAY ON THE CROWN OF MY HEAD WERE FOR WHATEVER REASON MY HAIRS SEEMS TO GROW THICKEST OTHER PEOPLE LOSE HAIR ON THE CROWN IN THE BACK AND TOP BUT NOT IN THE FRONT AND SOME PEOPLE LOSE IT ALL OVER NOW YOU UNDERSTAND WHY HAIR LOSS OCCURS IN CERTAIN REGIONS OF THE BODY YOU SHOULD ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THE ANDROGEN RECEPTORS ON THE FACE ARE ALSO WHAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR BEARD GROWTH AND THIS IS WHERE IT CAN GET A LITTLE BIT TRICKY BUT A LOT OF THINGS WILL TART TO MAKE SENSE IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THIS AND INTERNALIZE THIS IF YOU HAVE A HY DENSITY OF ANDROGEN RECEPTORS ON YOUR FACE WELL THEN AS YOUR DEH TA LEVELS GO UP WITH AGE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO GROW A THICKER IN THICKER BEARD IN FACT IT IS RARE TO SEE SOME ONE WHO CAN GROW A THICK BEARD IN THEIR YOUTH BUT NOT SO MUCH AS THEY GET OLDER IN FACT THE REVERSE TENS TO BE TRUE SO THE PATTERN OF ANDROGEN RECEPTORS DIFFERS BETWEEN THE SCALP AND THE FACE AND THE BACK AY ON YOUR BACK YOU HAVE ANDROGEN RECEPTORS AND THEIR DEH T STIMULATES HAIR GROWTH SO IF YOU KNOW SO ONE WHO HAS A VERY HAIRY BACK OR IF YOU HAVE A VERY HAIRY BACK I MEAN YOU HAVE A HYDENSY OF ANDROGEN RECEPTORS ON YOUR BACK FYOU HAVE A BEARD AND THAT BEARD IS THICK WELL THEN YOU HAVE A HYDENSITY OF ANDROGEN RECEPTORS ON YOUR FACE HOWEVER A HYDENSITY OF ANDROGEN RECEPTORS ANYWHERE ON YOUR SCALP IS GOING TO PREDISPOSE THOSE REGIONS TO ANDROGEN DEPENDENT ALAPESHA OR HAIR LOSS IN THOSE PARTICULAR REGIONS WHICH IS GOING TO ALLOW US TO UNDERSTAND WHY ALL THE REST OF THE TREATMENTS FOR HOLTING HAIR LOSS AND FOR STIMULATING HAIR GROWTH ALMOST ALL OF THOSE CENTER ON INHIBITING EITHER D H T DIRECTLY OR FIVE ALFOR ADUCTAES THE CONVERSION OF TESTASTERONE TO D H T SO NOW I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS THE WAYS THAT ONE CAN CHEMICALLY ADJUST CERTAIN THINGS WITHIN THE HAIR GROWTH PATHWAY THINGS LIKE IG F ONE P DE E T C ABADA ET CETERA IN ORDER TO STIMULATE HAIR GROWTH OR HULT HAIR LOSS THE FIRST THING ON THIS LIST IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE PRETTY SURPRISING TO A NUMBER OF VOW AND THAT'S KAFFINE WE ALL THINK OF KAFFINE IS A STIMULANT THAT WE DRINK I CERTAINLY DRINK COFFEE AND URBAMATE OCCASIONAL ENERGY DRINK THINGS OF THAT SORT KAFFINE DOES MANY THINGS BESIDES STIMULATE OUR CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM AND MAKE US FEEL LESS SLEEPY HOWEVER ONE OF THE THINGS THAT KAFINE DOES IS IT IS A FAIRLY POTENT P D E INHIBITER BY BEING A POTENT P D  INHIBITER IT INDIRECTLY STIMULATES IG F ONE WHY WELL BECAUSE P D E CAN SUPPRESS IG F ONE AND BY INGESTING KAFFINE OR BY APPLYING TOPICAL KAFFINE OINTMENT OR CREAM TO THE SCALP YOU CAN SUPPRESS P D E SUFFICIENTLY ENOUGH TO INCREASE IG F ONE AND INCREASE SOME HAIR GROWTH OR AT LEAST MAINTAIN HAIR GROWTH IN THAT REGION THIS MAY COME AS IT SHOCK IT MIGHT SEEM A LITTLE BIT ESOTERIC REAVING OUTSIDE THE MARGINS OF TYPICAL TREATMENTS BUT HEAD TO HEAD TOPICAL KAFFINE APPLICATION CAN BE AS EFFECTIVE AS MONOXIDIL APPLICATION WITHOUT ACTUALLY LOWERING THINGS LIKE BLOOD PRESSURE AND POTENTIALLY INCREASING PROLACTIN AND SOME OF THE OTHER NEGATIVE IT'S CALL THEM NEGATIVE BECAUSE THEY ARE SIDE EFFECTS OF MONOXIDO SO KAFFINE OINTMENTS AND KAFFINE PRESENT IN VARIOUS HAIR TREATMENTS AND CREAMS ET CETERA IS STARTING TO BECOME A MORE PROMINENT FEMALE THERE I WILL INCLUDE A REFERENCE TO KAFFINE AND ITS USES FOR OFFSETTING HAIR LOSS KEEP IN MIND THAT TOPICAL KAFINE OINTMENTS SHOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE APPLIED EVERY SINGLE DAY SO THIS IS THE SORT OF THING YOU MIGHT DO THREE TIMES A WEEK THE CONCENTRATION OF KAFF INE AND IFFERENT OINTMENTS VARIES TREMENDOUSLY MOST OF THE STUDIES OF KAFFINE ON THE STEMSEL NICHES THAT CONTROL HAIR GROWTH AN EXTENSION OF THE ANAGEN PHASE OF HAIR GROWTH HAVE BEEN PERFORMED IN VETRO IN A DISH ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME CLINICAL STUDIES EXPLORING THIS THEY ARE NOT NEARLY AS EXTENSIVE IN NUMBER OR DURATION AS THE STUDIES OF MANOXIDIL BECAUSE THIS APPROACH JUST HASN'T BEEN AROUND QUITE AS LONG HOWEVER WHEN COMPARING SIDE EFFECTS OF MINOXDIL COST OF MINOXIDIL COMPARING THE EFFICACY OF KAFFNE AND MANOXIDIL I THINK KAFFINE AS A TOPICAL TREATMENT FOR OFFSETTING HEIRLOSS STANDS AS A PRETTY GOOD CHOICE IF YOURE GOING TO START EXPLORING THIS PATHWAY AND THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK THAT IF YOU WERE TO TRY THE KAFFIN OINTMENT AND IT DIDN'T WORK FOR YOU OR YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT FOR SOME REASON OR YOU NEEDED TO STOP IT FOR SOME REASON THAT YOU COULDN'T STOP IT SAFELY BECAUSE IT DOESN'T CARRY ALL THE OTHER AND A BLOOD PRESSURE RELATED AFFACTS AND PROLACTONEMIA EFFECTS THAN MANOXIDIL DOES SO F YOU LOOK OUT THERE INTO THE HERE MAINTENANCE AND HAIR REPLACEMEN LITERATURE YOU LOOK AT THE TREATMENTSTHAT ARE BEING SOLD DON'T BE SURPRISED TO SEE KAFFINE THERE AND ALSO DON'T BE SURPRISED WHEN I TELL YOU WHATI'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU NOW WHICH IS NO YOU CAN'T SIMPLY JUST DRINK MORE KAFFINE IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH A THE GOAL OF OFFSETTING HAIR LOSS IT IS TRUE THAT WHEN YOU INJEST KAFFINE IT GOES SYSTEMICALLY HOWEVER YOU HAVE SO MANY A DENISINE RECEPTORS THROUGHOUT YOUR BODY THOSE A DENISINES RECEPTORS AND THE PARKING OF KAFFINE IN THOSE A DENISINE RECEPTORS IS THE MAIN WAY IN WHICH KAFFINE EXERTS ITS STIMULATORY EFFECTS MAKING FEEL LESS SLEEPY SO IT DOES THAT BECAUSE THEN A DENIZINE CAN'T HAV ITS EFFECTS WHICH R TO MAKE YOU SLEEPY WELL THOSE A DENIZINE RECEPTORS SOAK UP SO MUCH OF THE KAFFINE THAT YOU WOULD INJEST ORALLY THAT VERY VERY LITTLE WOULD MAKE IT TO THE SCALP AND TO THE HEIRFOLICALS AT THE CONCENTRATIONS THAT YOU WOULD WANT SO THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE TO RELY ON THE APPLICATION OF THESE KAFFINE OINTMENTS ABOUT THREE TIMES A WEEK KEEP IN MIND THAT NO ONE HAS REALLY EXPLORED THE DOSAGES OF KAFFINE IN THESE OINTMENTS IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY WE ARE STILL IN THE EARLY STAGES OF ALL THIS BUT I DO THINK IT'S IMPORT NTO MENTION KAFFINE BECAUSE OF THE LOWER INCIDENTS OF SIDE EFFECTS AT LEAST FOR P ORDED SIDE EFFECTS AND THE GENERAL SAFETY MARGINS END THE HEAD TO HEAD ESSENTIALLY COMPARABLE EFFICACY WITH MONOXIDIL BECAUSE MONOXIL HAS A BUNCH OF OTHER ISSUES NOW KEEP IN MIND THAT BOTH MONOXIDIL AND KAFFINE BARE GENERALLY USED AS A PREVENTATIVE FOR REDUCING HAIR LOSS OVER TIME THEY ARE NOT EXPECTED AND THEY DO NOT AS FAR AS WE KNOW CREATE NEW HAIR GROWTH TO ANY SUFFICIENT DEGREE IF ANY OF YOU HAVE USED KAFFINOINTMENTS OR MONOXIDIL AND OBSERVE NEW HAIR GROWTH THAT WAS ROBUST PLEASE PUT THAT IN THE COMMENT SECTION I BE CURIOUS ABOUT THOSE EXPERIENCES BUT AS FAR AS I KNOW AND FROM THE CLINICAL LITERATURE THAT I READ THERE'S NO EXAMPLES OF THAT ONE OTHER POINT ABOUT KAFFINE IT DOES APPEAR THAT KAFFINE CAN NOT ONLY INDIRECTLY STIMULATE IGEF ONE IN THE ENAGEN PHASE OF HAIR SELL GROWTH BY WAY OF REDUCING PT AN T G AF FETA BUT IT ALSO SEEMS TO REDUCE APOTOSIS WHICH IS NATURALLY OCCURRING SELL DEATH OF THAT STEMSELL NICHE WE BEN TALKING LOT ABOUT THE ENAGENOR GROWTH PHASE OF HAIR WE ALSO TALKED BY THE CATTIGEN WHERE THE RECESSION OF THAT HAIR FROM THE INSIDE OUT BUT REMEMBER THAT THIRD PHASE THE TILIGEN PHASE WHERE THAT WHOLE BULB DOWN AT THE BOOM THE BULGES ITS CALLD GETS PINCHED OFF AND HOLDING DIES AND TAKES THE STEMSELLS OFF TO THE GRAVE WITH IT IT APPEARS THAT KAFFINE CAN OFFSET THE DEATH OF THAT NICHE AND POTENTIALLY MAINTAIN THE STEMSELL POPULATION LONGER MAKING KAFFIN A REALLY GOOD CHOICE TO THINK ABOUT IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE VARIOUS CHEMICAL TREATMENTS AIMED AT DIRECTLY ATTACKING THE D H TEA PATHWAY THAT WILL TALK ABOUT NEXT SO THERE'S ONE VERY DIRECT WAY TO INCREASE HAIR GROWTH AND MAINTAIN THE HAIR THAT YOU HAVE ON YOUR HEAD AND THAT'S TO INCREASE IGEF ONE THAT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHE THROUGH PRESCRIPTION DRUGS SUCH AS GROWTHORMONE AND THINGS THAT STIMULATE THE RELEASE OF GROWTHORMON AND IGF ONE KEEP IN MIND GROWTHORMONA'S RELEASED FROM THE ANTERO POTUITORY DURING THE FIRST HOURS OF SLEEP ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVENG EATEN ANYTHING FOR THE TWO HOURS PRIOR TO SLEEP AND ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU GET REGULAR BEDTIMES YES THIS IS A REAL THING IF YOU ARE RE GOING TO SLEEP AT VARIABLE BEDTIMES ESPECIALL IF YOU GO TO SLEEP MUCH LATER THAN YOUR USUAL HABITUAL BEDTIME YOU WILL MISS THAT GROWTH HORMON PULSE THAT NORMALLY OCCURS IN THE FIRST TWO TO THREE HOURS OF SLEEP THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU NEED TO BE NEURODIC ABOUT GETTING TO SLEEP AT THE EXACT SAME TIME EVERY NIGHT TIS PRUBLIC PLUSERMINS THIRTY MINUTE WINDOW AND IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU CAN'T STAY OUT LAID OR HAVE A BAD NIGHT SLEEP EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE OR GET WOKEN UP YOUR HAIR ISN'T CAN FALL OUT MY THAT STORY NOTWITHSTANDING YOUR HAIR ISN'T CAN ALL FALL OUT BECAUSE OF THAT BUT YOU DO WANT TO TRY AND GET THAT NATURAL GROWTH HORMONE RELEASE EACH NIGHT AND AS I MENTION THERE ARE PRESCRIPTION APPROACHES AND THOSE ARE GROWTH HORMONE ITSELF AND THINGS LIKE SIRMORELLEN WHICH IS A PEPTIDE THAT INCREASES GROWTH HORMONE IT'S ACTUALLY A SECRETE A GOG IT CAUSES THE SECRETION OF GROWTH HORMONE AND THEREBY INCREASES IN IGEIF ONE THIS IS WELL DOCUMENTED BOTH GROWTH HORMONE AND IGEIF ONE AS I MENTION ARE AVAILABLE BUT PRESCRIPTION THEY ARE NOT WITHOUT THEIR SIDE EFFECTS SO THEY DO CAUSE GROWTH OF ALL TISSUES THEY DO INCREASE HEIGHT IN CHILDREN THEY INCREASE BONE MASS AND DENSITY THEY CAN INCREASE MAINLY FAT LOST NOT SO MUCH MUSCLE SIZE BUT THEY CAN INCREASE LEANNESS AND THEY INCREASE HAIR GROWTH THEY CAN INCREASE TURN OVER OF SKIN THEY CAN MAKE SKIN LOOK MORE YOUTHFUL ALL THESE THINGS SOUND WONDERFUL AND YET THEY ALSO HAVE PROBLEMS BECAUSE THEY CAN INCREASE GROWTH OF SMALL TUMORS THAT NORMALLY MIGHT BE ELIMINATED SO THERE IS AT INCREASED CANCER RISK WITH GROWTH HORMONE TREATMENTS IN IGEIF ONE OR ANYTHING THAT INCREASES IGI ONE SUCH AS SIRMORELL AND IPREMOROLAN ANY OF THE PEPTIDES THAT YOU HEAR ABOUT NOWADAYS THAT SAID A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE USING SIRMORELLAN AS AN INDIRECT WAY TO INCREASE IGIF ONE AND THEREBY TO INCREASE HAIR GROWTH IT DOES SEEM TO BE FAIRLY EFFECTIVE IN DOINGTHAT ESPECIALLY WHEN DONE IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER TREATMENTS THAT WILL TALK ABOUT BUT KEEP IN MIND THESE ARE PRESRIPTION DRUGS AND THEY DO CARRY THEIR OWN RISKS THE OTHER THING ABOUT STIMULATING THE NATURAL PRODUCTION OF IGEIF ONE IS THAT AS ITS NAMES SUGGESTS INSOLEN GROWTH FACTOR ONE IT IS INSOLEN DEPENDENT IN MANY WAYS IF NOT FOR ITS SECRETION THAN FOR ITS ACTION AT THE HAIR PHOLICAL AND STEMSELL SO ONE OF THE THINGS YOU REALLY WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO IS TO AVOID BEING INSOLEN RESISTANT OR RATHER YOU WANT TO TRY TO BE INSOLENT SENSITIVE SO IFYOUR CARRYING A LOT OF EXCESS BODY FACT YOUR OBEES OR IF YOU HAVE TYPE TO DIABETIES MEAN YOUR INSOLENT RESISTANT YOURE GOING TO WANT TO DEAL WITH THAT THEIR NUMBER PRESCRIPTION TREATMENTS TO DEAL WITH THAT NOWADAYS PEOPLE ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT ALL THE GEOL P ONE AGONIS BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT REGULAR CARDOFASCULAR EXERCISE AND RESISTANCE EXERCISE MAKING SURE THAT YOUR BODY FAT PERCENTAGE IS NOT IN EXCESS OF WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE AND EVERYONE HAS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT IDEA OF WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE BOTH COSMETICALLY AND FOR HEALTH SO THAT'S A CONVERSATION BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR DOCTOR AND YOU AND YOU FRANKLY BUT YOU WANT TO AVOID BEING INSOLENT RESISTANT BECAUSE BEING INSOLENT RESISTANT AND BEING OBEES CAN INDEED LEAD TO HEIRLOSS AND THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE OUT THER WHO ARE NOTO BEES WHO NONE THE LESS ARE EXPERIENCING HEIRTHINING AND HEIRLOSS BECAUSE THEY ARE INSOLENT RESISTANT BY WAY OF REDUCED IGEIF ONE ACTIVITY THERE ARE A FEW SUPPLEMENTS SO THESE ARE OVER THE COUNTER SUPPLEMENTS SUCH AS MAYOAND OCITAL TAKEN AT DOSAGES OF ABOUT NINE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS BEFORE SLEEP WHICH BY THE WAY CAN ALSO ASSIST IN SLEEP OR THINGS LIKE BERBERING OR MET FOREMEN WHICH ARE KNOWN TO IMPROVE INSOLEN SENSITIVITY EACH IN EVERY ONE OF THESE HAS ITS OWN PROFILE OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EFFECTS THE LOWEST NUMBER OF SIDE EFFECTS IS ASSOCIATED WITH NINE HUNDRED MILIGRAM MIOANOCITAL TAKEN ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES BEFORE SLEEP MOST BECAUSE IT CAN MAKE PEOPLE LO IT DROWSY AND IT DOES AID SLEEP IN SOME RELY GREAT WAYS BUT REALLY EXERCISE IN MAINTAINING A HEALTHY NUTRITIONAL PROGRAM ARE ALSO GOING TO BE KEY YOU JUST CAN'T DISCARD THOSE BERBERINE WHICH IS A SUBSTANCE MADE FROM TREE BARK IS SOMETIMES CALL THE POOREMAN'S MET FOREMAN MET FOREMAN BEING THE EQUALLY EFFECTIVE PRESCRIPTION VERSION OF BERBERING OR PUT DIFFERENTLY BERBERING IS THE NON PRESCRIPTION BUT EQUALLY EFFECTIVE VERSION OF MET FOREMAN KEEP IN MIND THAT BOTH BERBRING AND MET FOREMAN DRAMATICALLY REDUC S BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS AND SO IF YOU'RE NOT KING TO TAKE THEM WITH CARBAHIDRAS IT CAN LEAD TO SOME FEELINGS OF DISCOMFORT THAT'S WHY I'M NOT A FAN OF THEM BUT IF YOUR GOAL IS TO REALLY IMPROVE INSOLENT SENSITIVITY THEY ARE CONSIDERED VERY POTENT TOOLS ON THE LIST OF THINGS THAT CAN DO THAT THE OTHER THING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR MAINTAINING PROPER HAIR GROWTH THIS ANAGEN PHASEIS THAT YOU NEED SUFFICIENT IRON THIS IS BECAUSE IRON AND FARITAN PLAY A KEY ROLL IN THE SELLGROWTH PATHWAYS THAT GO FROM THE STEMCELLS TO THE STIMULATION OF CARITON WITHIN THE HAIR ITSELF DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO INTO THIS PATHWAY AND A LOT OF DETAIL BUT YOU CAN HAVE YOUR BLOOD LEVELS OF IRON MEASURED STURNS OUT TO BE PRETTY IMPORTANT BECAUSEYOU DON'T JUST WANT TO START POPPING IRON SUPPLEMENTS BECAUSE TOO MUCH IRON CAN BE TOXIC TOO LITTLE INS YOUR ANEMIC FOR WOMEN THE LEVELS OF IRON THAT YOU WANT ARE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND ONE HUNDRED AND FOR MEN SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THIRTY AND ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FORTUNATELY THE TESTS OR THE BLOOD TESTS FOR IRON ARE USUALLY A VERY INEXPENSIVE ADD TO YOUR CURRENT BLOOD PANEL SO IF YOU'RE GOING IN FOR A BLOOD PANEL FOR EL DEL H DEEL AN A TYPICAL THINGS OR IF YOURE DOING THE MORE ELABORATE HORMONE TESTING WHICH I DO E RECOMMEND PEOPLE DO IF THEY CAN AFFORD IT OR IF THEIR INSURANCE COVERS IT DO ASK FOR AN IRON TEST AS WELL AND IF YOUR IRON IST LOW YOU MAY NEED TO SUPPLEMENT YOUR IRON IF YOUR IRON IS TOO HIGH THAT'S NOT GOOD EITHER BUT IRON PLAYS A KEY ROLL IN THE ANAGEN PHASE OF HAIR GROWTH SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU AT LEAST HAVE SUFFICIENT IRON AND IF YOU DON'T YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE GETTING IT FROM NUTRICION AND OR SUPPLEMENTATION O CASE O EARLIER WE WERE TALKING ABOUT DY HYDROTESTOSTRONE DIHYDR TESTOSRONE JUST TO JOG YOUR MEMORY IS A FORM OF TESTOSTRONE THAT CAN BIND THE ANDROGEN RECEPTOR AT FIVE TIMES THE AFFINITY OF REGULAR TESTOSTRONE BOTH MEN AND WOMEN HAVE A LOT OF TESTOSTRON RELATIVE TO ASTERGEN JUST SO HAPPENS THAT MEN TEN TO HAVE MORE TESTOSTRONE THAN WOMEN DO OVER ALL BUT BOTH MEN AND WOMEN AS THEY AGE CONVERT MORE OF THE TESTOSTRONE THEY HAVE TO DIHYDR TESTOSTRNE AND DIHYDR TESTOSTRONE DOES TWO THINGS THAT ARE BAD FOR HAIR MAINTENANCE AND HAIR GROWTH FIRST FO F ALL IT SHORTENS THE ANAGEN PHASE THAT GROWTH PHASE SO WHATEVER HAIR IS GOING TO GROW IS GOING TO OCUR OVER A SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME SECOND OF ALL BECAUSE OF THE PRESENCE OF ANDROGEN RECEPTORS ON THE STEMSEL NICHE AREA AND AROUND IT IT ACTUALLY MINIATURISES THE FALICAL AND THE STEMSELNICHE IN OTHER WORDS IT MAKES THE POPULATION OF CELLS THAT GIVE RISE TO MORE HAIR PROTINE SMALLER AND CAN ELIMINATE IT ALTOGETHER AND THAT IS WHY ANYTHING THAT REDUCES FIVE HAL FOR REDUCTES IS GOING TO REDUCE THE H T IS GOING TO MAINTAIN OR EXTEND THE GROWTH PHASE THE ANGEN PHASE OF HAIR GROWTH AND IS GOING TO OFFSET OR PEVENT SOME OF THE TILIGEN PHASE THE PINCHING OFF AND THE REMOVAL OF THAT STEM SEL NICHE NOW ONE SUBSTANCE THAT WE KNOW CAN INHIBIT FIVE AL FOR A DUCTES ALTHOUGH IT DOES IT PRETTY WEAKLY IS SAL PALMETTO WHICH IS AN EXTRACT OF THE SALPALMETTO BERRY TO BE HONEST I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS WAS INITIALLY DISCOVERED IF ANY ONE KNOWS PLEASE PUT IN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS WHEN I LOOKED ON LINE I FOUND A BUNCH OF CONFLICTING STORIES ABOUT WHO WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO START EXTRACTING THE AEXTRACT OF THE SALPALMETTOBERRIES SO I H'VE NO IDEA WHICH ONE THOSE IS TRUE MAYBE SOMEBODY CAN TELL ME THE GOD THING ABOUT SALPALMETTO TREATMENT IS THAT IT IS KNOWN TO HAVE VERY FEW IF ANY SIDE EFFECTS THERE MAYHT BE SOME SIDE AFFECTION ABOUT ONE PER CENT OF PEOPLE BUT IT'S NOT ASSOCIATE WITH A LOT OF SIDE EFFECTS IT'S ALSO KNOWN THAT WHEN TAKEN AT ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS PER DAY AND HERE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT STRICT MOST O THE STUDIES THAT I EXPLORED INVOLVED TAKING ANYWHERE FROM TWO HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF SALPALMTTO BUT MOST OF THEM FOCASED ON ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF SALPALMETTO PER DAY DIVIDED INTO TWO OR THREE DOSES WHY WELL AS A RELATIVELY SHORT HALF LIFE MEANING IT'SGOING TO GET CLEARED FROM THE BLOOD STREAM AND MORE IMPORTANTLY IT'S BIOLOGICAL ACTION AS CAN BE VERY SHORT LIVED SO IF YOU CAN GET A HOLD OF FIFTY OR A HUNDRED MILIGRAM CAPSILS OR TABLETS OF SALPALMETTO AND DIVIDE THOSE UP TAKING THEM IN THE MORNING AFTERNOON AN EVENING OR EVEN JUST IN THE MORNING AND EVENING TO ACHIEVE A TOTAL OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MELEGRAMS PERDAY THAT'S GOING TO VERY LIKELY HELP YOU HOLD ON TO SOME OF THE HAIR THAT YOU WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE LOST MAY BE EVEN GROW SOME NEW HAIR AND I SAY MAYBE GIVE YOU SOME NEW HAIRGROWTH BECAUSE SALPALMETTO IS NOT KNOWN TO BE A PARTICULARLY ROBUST TREATMENT FOR THE REVERSAL OF HAIRLOS IT'S KNOWN TO HAVE SOME EFFECT BUT IT'S GENERALLY TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH A BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS AND SO IT'S REALLY HARD TO TEASE OUT JUST WHAT AMOUNT OF HAIR GROWTH OR PREVENTION OF HAIR LOSS IS DUE TO SAL POMMETOR SPECIFICALLY BUT I MENTION IT HERE BECAUSE THE MECHANISM OF ACTION IS LOGICAL AND FAIRLY WELL KNOWN WHICH IS THIS WEAK EFFECT IN REDUCING FIVE ALFOREDUCTASTAN THEREBY REDUCING T H T AGAIN BECAUSE IT HAS RELATIVELY LOW SIDE EFFECTS EVEN TOUGH IT'S NOT SUPEREFFECTIVE AND BECAUSE IT'S FAIRLY LOW COST AND ITS AVAILABLE OVER THE COUNTER ELT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE NOW AS SOON AS PEOPLE HERE THINGS LIKE SALPALMETTO BERRY THERE PROBABLY ALSO THINKING OBOI HEROR COMALL THE ERBALES NOW KEEP IN MIND THAT THERE ARE SOME ERBAL COMPOUNDS THAT HAVE PRETTY ROBUST BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS TALK BEFORE IN ARE OPTIMIZING TO STOSTRONE EPISODES ABOUT THINGS LIKE TONGAALI AND FIDOGIAGRASTIS WHICH TAKEN IN CORRECT DOSAGES AND IN THE CORRECT WAY CAN BE PRETTY POTENT FOR INCREASING LUTINIZING HORMONE AND FREE TESTOSTRON I CAN HAVE HUGE EFFECTS NOT LIKE TAKING EXOPTIONS ANABOLIC STEROIDS BUT THEY CAN HAVE REAL EFFECTS AND SO ERBAL COMPOUNDS CAN BE POTENT HOWEVER I DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEREIS A VAST MARKET OUT THERE OF ERBAL COMPOUNDS AND PLANTBASE COMPOUNDS THAT PEOPLE ARE ARGUING MUST LEE THE PEOPLE WHO SELDOM ARE ARGUING CAN INCREASE HAIR GROWTH AND THERE ARE SOME DECENT STUDIES OF THESE THINGS THE HARD PART ABOUT STUDYING THESE ERBAL COMPOUNDS AND THESE PLANT DERIVE COMPOUNDS FOR INCREASING HAIR GROWTH IS THAT THEY ARE OFTEN TAKEN IN COMMINATION WITH ONE ANOTHER IN FACT MOST OF THE HAIR GROWTH SUPPLEMENTS THAT IN VALL THESE ERBAL COMPOUNDS AND PLANT COMPOUNDS INCLUDE FIVE OR TEN SOMETIMES EVEN MORE THINGS ALTOGETHER SO TEASING OUT WHICH ONES ARE EFFECTIVE IN WHICH DOSAGES ARE EFFECTIVE IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE THEY'RE JUST TOO MANY VARIABLES SO YOU WILL HEAR FOR INSTANCE THAT GREEN T EXTRACT RACY MUSHROOM PUMPKIN OIL ZINC KIRKUMAN THAT ALL OF THESE THINGS CAN INCREASE HAIR GROWTH PERHAPS THE ONLY THING ON THAT LIST THAT MAKES LOGICAL SENSE WITH RESPECT TO THE BIL CHEMISTRY IS THAT KIRKUMAN IS KNOWN TO IN SOME PEOPLE BE A POTENT INHIBITER A FIVE FAL FOR A DUCTAST AND D H T SO MUCH SO THAT I CAN PERSONALLY SAY FOR ME I ONCE TOOK KIRKUMAN TUMERIC IT'S ALSO CALLED IN HY DOSAGE AS ABOUT A GRAM TO TWO GRAHAM CAPSILS AND I FELT ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE I MAN JUST DREADFUL I DON'T CARE IF IT ALLOWED ME TO KEEP MY HAIR FOREVER I'D RATHER LOSE ALL MY HAIR THREE TIMES OVER LIKE AS THAT MEANS IT WOULD HAVE GROWN BACK I'D RATHER LOSE ALL MY HAIR WAT'S JUST PUT IT THAT WAY THEN EVER TAKE KIRKUMEN OR TUMERIC AND HIGH DOSAGES AGAIN AND IN SAYING THAT I KNOW THAT MANY PEOPLE TAKE TUMERIC AN KIRKUMEN AND REALLY LIKE ITS ANTI INFLAMATORY PROPERTIES AND DON'T EXPERIENCE ANY SIDE EFFECTS I JUST HAPPEN TO BE PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE TO KIRKUMEN BY WAY OF THIS D H T PATHWAY AND I KNOW THIS BY WAY OF BLOOD WORK SO I'M NEVER GOING NEAR THAT STUFF AGAIN THAT SAID A LOT OF THESE ERBALE COMPOUNDS AND COCKTAILS PROBABLY WILL HAVE SOME MINOR MARGINAL INFANTISIMILY SMALL SOMEWHERE IN THAT RANGE A FACT ON MAINTAINING HAIR GROWTH OR IN STIMULATING NEW HAIR GROWTH IS JUST THAT THEIR REALLY AREN'T CLINICAL STUDIES TO SUPPORT ANY ONE OF THEM AND THAT'S WHY I SINGLED OUT SALPALMETTO IS ONE OF THE FEW FOR WHICH THE BILE CHEMICAL PATHWAY OF IN HIBITING FALFAL FOR REDUCTAS AND THE LOW INSTANCE OF SIDE EFFECTS AND THE FACT THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE USED IT WITH SOME DEGREE OF SUCCESS MAKES IT A STAND ALONE I WOULD'T SAY RECOMMENDATION BUT A CONSIDERATION ANOTHER COMMONLY DISCUSSED AND USE COMMERCIAL COMPOUND FOR OFFSETTING HAIR LOSS AND STIMULAING HAIR GROWTH IS QUEITO CONNISSAL SOMETIMES THIS IS KNOWN AS NISARALL WHERE NISAR ALL IS THE BRANNAME OF A CHAMPOO QUETO CONNISAL IS AN ANTI FUNGL THAT WAS INITI LLY DEVELOP TO TREAT DANDREFF AND SEVERE SERIASIS SO QUITO CONNISOL HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN INCREASING HAIR NUMBER IT'S ALSO BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN INCREASING HAIR DIAMETER WHICH IS SOMEWHAT SURPRISING BECAUSE ONE OF THE COMMON SIDE EFFECTS OF QUITO CONNISOL IS DRAYING HINNING AND BRITTLE HAIR SO WHAT'S GOING ON THERE IS A LITTLE ON CLEAR WILL RETURN TO THAT IN A MOMENT THE MECHANISM OF ACTION FOR QUITO CONNISOL'S PRETTY INTERESTING REMEMBER EARLIER WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE SABACIOUS GLAND IN THE PRODUCTION OF SEEBAM THAT OILY STUFF WHOSE VERY NAMES SEEMS TO EVOKE DISCUST IN CERTAIN PEOPLE WELL QUITO CONNAISOL CAN DESRUPT SOME OF THE FUNGAL GROWTH THAT FRANKLY WE ALL HAVE ON OUR SCALP ALL THE TIME I KNOW THIS IS A SURPRISE TO MANY OF YOU BUT YOU ARE CONSTANTLY BOMBARDED WITH VIRASES BACTERIA AND FUNGASES ALL THE TIME BUT WE MANISH A BATTLE THOSE OFF WITH OUR AMUNE SYSTEM EITHER BY PHYSICAL BARRIER SUCH AS AN OIL BARRIER LIKE THE SEEBAM OR THROUGH ANTEMACROBIAL ACTION SO CHEMICAL APPROACHES OUR MUN SYSTEM THE SEBAM ET CETERA QUTO CONNISOL ACES AN ANTIFUNGAL THAT IN SOME WAY SEEMS TO REINFORCE THE PROPERTIES OF SEEBAM AT KEEPING OUT OTHER FUNGAL INFECTIONS AND THE NET OF FACT AT LEAST AS FAR AS WE KNOW IS A MILD REDUCTION IN D H T NOW EXACTLY HOW THIS HAPPENS ISN'T IT REALLY CLEAR WHAT IS CLEAR IS THAT THE USE OF QUITO CONNISOL CHAMPOOS TWO TO FOUR TIMES PER WEEK WITH A SCALP CONTACT TIME OF ABOUT THREE TO FIVE MINUTES HAS BEEN SHOWN TO GIVE ABOUT AN EIGHTY PER CENT RESPONSORY OF MAINTAINING HAIR THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE LOST SO THAT'S PRETTY DRAMATIC EIGHTY PER CENT WHAT IS LESS CLEAR IS WHETHER NOT QUITO CONNISL CHAMPOO CAN ACTUALLY STIMULATE NEW HAIR GROWTH BUT AS YOUR PROBABLY TRYING TO REALIZE THIS IS ALWAYS A BIT OF A TOUGH THING TO DISENTANGLE MAINTENANCE OF HAIR THAT YOU WOULD HAVE LOST VERSES NEW HAIR GROWTH CERTAINLY THAT'S AN EASY THING TO DISIMBIGUATE IF YOU HAVE A PATCH OF SCALP WHERE THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO HAIR ES A SO CALLED DEAD ZONES THAT YOU CAN RESURRECT WITH CERTAIN TREATMENTS B UT WHAT ABOUT AREAS OF YOUR SCALP WHERE T HAIR IS THINNING SO FOR INSTANCE ON THE TOP YOUR HEAD IS WHERE MANY WOMEN WILL FIRST EXPERIENCE A PATTERN HAIR LOSS ALOPICHA IS A RIGHT AT THEIR MIDLINE YNO IF ESPECIALY IF THEY HAVE A PART RIGHT THERE THEY'LL START TO NOTICE THAT UNDER VERY BRIGHT LIGHT FLORESCENT LIGHTS IND PARTICULAR THEY'LL NOTICE THE THING OF THEIR HAIR THERE OR IN THE FOREHEAD REGION THEYLL START USING QEITO CONNISOL CHAMPOO AGAIN THE TYPICAL RECOMMENDATION IS TWOTOFOUR TIMES PER WEEK ITHE SCALP CONTACT TIME OF THREETO FIVE MINUTES AND REALLY RUBBING IT IN AND THEN RENSING IT OUT YOU DON'T NE T BE SUPERVIGOROUS BUT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT GETS DOWN INTO THE PHOLICAL AND AROUND THE PHOLICALS NOT JUST SITTING ON TOP OF THE HAIR WHICH IS GOING TO BE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE HAVE LONG HAIR TO REALLY MISAGE IT IN WELL THEY WILL EXPERIENCE A GROWTH OF HAIR IN THAT PARTICULAR REGION THAT ALMOST CERTAINLY WERE DUE TO MINIATURIZATION OF THE HEIRFOLICAL AND REDUCTION OF THE TOTAL POPULATION OF STEMSELLS IN THAT PHOLICAL AS SUPPOSED TO COMPLETE LOSS OF THE STEMSOL POPULATION THE REASON WE SAY THIS IS THAT THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK THAT QUEITO CONNISOL CAN ACTUALLY STIMULATE IGEIF ONE OR ACT IF A GROWTH ITSELF IT'S PROBABLY OFFSETTING SOME OF THE REDUCTIONS IN THE ENAGENPHASE AND SOME OF THE EXASCERBATION OF THE TILLIGEN PHASE NOW IF YOU DECIDE TO USE QUTO CONNISOL AS AN APPROACH TO OFFSETTING HAIR LOSS IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU GET A HOLD OF A CHAMPOO THAT AT LEAST TWO PER CENT CONCENTRATION OF QUEITO CONNISSOL THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE A LOT OF THE ONESTHAT ARE AVAILABLE OUT THERE ESPECIALLY ON LINE ARE GOING TO BE ONE PER CENT OR LOWER SO YOU WANT TO TRY ND OBTAIN A QETO CONNISOL SCHAMPOO OF TWO PER CENT OR HIER CONCENTRATION OF QUTOCONISSOL CAS AS OTHER THINGS IN IT OF COURSE I SHOULD MENTION THAT THERE ARE OCCASIONAL SIDE EFFECTS WITH QUEITOCONNISSOL THE RATES OF SIDE EFFECTS FROM THE METANALSES AND REVIEWS THE DIRED WERE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ONE AND EIGHT PER CENT OF PEOPLE WILL EXPERIENCE SOME SIDE EFFECTS BUT THOSE SIDEIFFECTS TEND TO BE PRETTY MILD THINGS LIKE IRRITATION OF THE SCALP THINGS LIKE FINNING AND BRITTLENESS OF THE HAIR THAT SOMETIMES CAN BE OFFSET BY USING CHAMPOOS THAT CONTAIN THINGS LIKE BIATON I KNOW MANY PEOPLE ARE PROTY CURIOUS ABOUT BIATIN WHICH IS A PROTINE THAT CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO THE CARITON A WHETHER OR NOT DIFFERENT BIATON IN RICH CHAMPOOS CAN REALLY ENHANCE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF BIATON THAT GETS INCORPORATED INTO THE HAIR IS 'N CLEAR BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT HAVING SUFFICIENT BIATON AROUND IS IMPORTANT SO IF YOU GET A LOBEDEXTRA FROM YOUR CHAMPOO CAN IMAGINE HOW THAT WOULD QUITICO TAP OFF THE AMOUNT OF BIATAN IN THAT HAIR AND THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE SAYING THAT BIATON IN RICH CHAMPOOS HAVE DONE WONDERS FOR THEM WHO KNOWS I I'M NOT GOING TO DISPUTE THEIR EXPERIENCE SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE KEITOCONIZOL KEEP IN MINE THAT THE MORE TYPICAL BRANNAMES THAT ARE OUT THERE YOU KNOW WICH ONES THEY ARE OFTENTIMES DON'T HAVE TO PER CENT OR IF THEY DO HAVE TWO PER CENT THEY CAN BE VERY DRAWING AND LEAD TO BRITTLE HAIR THERE ARE NEWER AND NOW FORTUNATELY A GREATER VARIETY OF KEITACONIZOL CONTAINING SHAMPOOS WE IS A PODCAST AND I DON'T HAVE ANY AFFILIATION TO ANY OF THESE BUT I WILL PROVIDE A LINX TO A COUPLE OF THE MORE PROMINENT ONES THAT ARE KNOWN TO HAVE TWO PER CENT CONCENTRATION OF KITOCONIZOL AS WELL AS SOME OTHER THINGS IN THEM KNOWN TO OFFSET SOME OF THAT DRYNESS AND BRITTLENESS THAT KEETO CONISAL CHAMPOOS CAN TRIGGER SO BY NOW I THINK IT WILL BE ABUNDANTLY CLEAR WHY INHIBITING FIVE ALFOR REDUCTAS AND THEREBY REDUCING TH H T SHOULD INCREASE HAIRGROWTH BECAUSE OF THE NEGATIVE IMPACT THAT D H T HAS ON THE HAIRFOLICAL THE MAJOR PLAYER IN THIS WHOLE STORY AROUND INHIBITING FIVE ALFOREDUCTAS AND REDUCING T H  TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE HAIR GROWTH IS GOING TO BE FINASTERIDE AND ITS CLOSE COUSIN DO TASTERIDE FINASTERIDE IS EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING TH H T BECAUSE OF ITS ACTIONS IN REDUCING THE TYPE TOO ISO AND ZIME OR ICAFORM OF FIVE ALFOR REDUCTAS IT TURNS OUT THEIR'S THREE DIFFERENT ICIFORMS ARE WHAT ARE SOMETIMES CALLED ISOENZIMES OF FIVE ALOREDUCTES THIS IS GETTING PRETTY FAR DOWN IN THE WEEDS WHAT I THINK MOST OF YOU JUST NEED TO KNOW IS THAT FINASTERIDE REDUCES D H T THAT'S THE NET PRODUCT OF FINASTERIDE AND IN DOING SO IT CAN INCREASE HAIR COUNT BY AS MUCH AS TWENTY PER CENT PRETTY REMARKABLE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IN ADDITION FINASTERIDE TREATMENT DONE PROPERLY WHICH WILL DEFINE IN A MOMENT CAN REDUCE HAIR LOSS IN NINETY PER CENT OF ALL PEOPLE THAT TAKE IT THAT IS IAM A NEAR STAGGERING MEND THERE AREN'T MANY FARMASUITACLES OUT THERE THAT HAVE THAT KIND OF EFFICACY REALLY DRAMATIC AND IN ADDITION IT'S KNOWN TO INCREASE HAIR THICKNESS BY ABOUT TWENTY TO THIRTY PER CENT OVER ALL ZONOCIOUS CREATE NEW GROWTH OF HAIRS AND THICKER HAIRS BUT WHATEVER HAIR YOU DO HAVE 'ND HAVE ON YOUR HEAD IT CAN FURTHER THICK IN THOSE SO THE FINASTERIDE STORY IS ONE I THINK OF GENERAL SUCCESS I MEAN IT REALLY SEEMS TO IMPROVE HAIR GROWTH AND HELP YOU HOLD ON TO THE HAIR THAT YOU HAVE THE ISSUE WITH FINASTERIDE IS TWOFOLD FIRST OF ALL IT IS KNOWN TO HAVE SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT SIDE EFFECTS IF IT'S NOT DOSED PROPERLY END IN PARTICULAR POPULATIONS OF PEOPLE AND THIS IS BECAUSE THERE IS A WIDE VARIATION IN THEN AMOUNT OF THE DIFFERENT ISO ENZIMES THAT PEOPLE MAKE I SIS WH I BROUGHT UP THE ISEWENZIMES EARLIER SOME PEOPLE MAKE MORE OF ISOWEN ZIME ONE AND THREE SOME PEOPLE MAKE MORE OF ISO ENZIME TWO AND THREE AND EVERY VARIATION THEREOF SO WHEN PEOPLE TAKE FINASTERIDE SOME PEOPLE ARE VERY STRONG RESPONDERS AND THEY ACHIEVE REALLY EFFECTIVE HAIR REGROWTH AND MAINTENANCE OF HAIR OTHER PEOPLE LESS EFFECTIVE ALTHOUGH STILL PRETTY IMPRESSIVE BUT THE CATALOGUE OF CIDE EFFECTS THAT PEOPLE EXPERIENCE ATA GIVEN DOSE VARIES WIDELY SO THERE'S A LOT OF TRIAL AN ERROR THAT HAS TO TAKE PLACE ALSO SHOULD POINT OUT THAT FINASTERIDE COMES IN TWO MAJOR FORMS THERE'S AN ORAL FORM AND THERE'S A TOPICAL FORM SO THIS IS NOT UNLIKE OUR DISCUSSION OF MONOXIDEL EARLIER TOPICAL FINASTERIDE IS TYPICALLY TAKEN IN ONE PER CENT SOLUTION OR OINTMENT AND RUBBED INTO THE HEAD SOMETIMES IT'S NOW ALSO INCORPORATED INTO SCHAMPOOSE BUT TYPICALLY IT'S PUT INTO A SOLUTION THAT PEOPLE RUB INTO THEIR HEAD AND IT IS THOUGHT THAT THE ONE PER CENT SOLUTIONS ARE EQUIVALENT TO ONE MILIGRAM OF SYSTEMIC FINASTRIDE I WE NEED TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND ASK WHY WAS FINASTORIDE DEVELOPED IN THE FIRST PLACE WHILE FINASTORIDE AS A BARELY POTENT FIVE ALPHORDUCTA IN HIBITOR IT'S GREAT AT LOWERIN D H T IT WAS DEVELOPED FOR TREATMENT OF PROSTATE ENLARGEMENT AND VARIOUS ISSUES OF THE PROSTATE THAT ARE ASSOCIATE WITH ELEVATE  H T THAT OCCURS WITH AGE THE TOPICAL FINASTORIDES WERE DESIGNED WITH THE HOPE THAT THE FINASTRIDE WOULD MAKE IT INTO THE HEIRPHOLICAL AND WOULD INHIBIT D H T THERE AND ALLOW FOR MORE GROWTH OF THE HAIR WHICH APPARENTLY T DOES BUT NOT MAKE IT INTO THE SYSTEMIC CIRCULATION OR AT LEASNOTIC CONCENTRATION SUFFICIENT ENOUGH TO CAUSE AS MANY SIDE EFFECTS AS WITH THE ORAL DOSING NOW THE PROBLEM IS IT DOES MAKE IT INTO SYSTEMIC CIRCULATION THE ISSUE IS ALSO THAT TOPICAL APPLICATION OF FINASTRIDE IS HARDER TO DOSE THAN ORAL FINASTORIDE NOT SAYING YOU SHOULD BE TAKING ORAL RATHER THAN TOPICAL FINASTRIDE BUT KEEP IN MIND THAT THE DOSAGES OF FINASTRIDE THAT HAV BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR INDUCING HAIR GROWTH COVER AN ENORMOUS RANGE SO AS LOW AS POINT ZERO ON MILIGRAMS PER DAY AND AS HIGH AS FIVE MILIGRAMS PER DAY WHICH IS A JUST STAGGERING RANGE NOW IN TRYING TO SIMPLIFY THE PROBLEM OF HOW MUCH FINASTRIDE TO TAKE EITHER BY WAY OF ORAL TABLET OR BY WAY OF TOPICAL SOLUTION WE CAN GET A BIT OF LEVERAGE ON THIS BY THINKING ABOUT HOW MUCH D H T REDUCTION OCCURS AS A FUNCTION OF DOSE AND THERE FINASTRIDE SHOWSS THIS REALLY INTERESTING WHAT'S CALLED LOGERHYTHMIC DISTRIBUTION WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT FOR A DOSAGE OF POINT ZERO ON MILIGRAMS OF FINASTRIDE YOU'RE GOING TO ACHIEVE APPROXIMATELY FIFTY PER CENT REDUCTION IN D H T AND THAT SYSTEMIC D H T SO THIS IS A BLOODRO MEASURING YOUR D H T THAN TAKING POINT ZERO ON MILIGRAMS OF FINASTRIDE AGAIN POINT ZERO ONE VERY LODOSE OF FINASTORIDE REPEARED A COUPLE WEEKS MEASURE PEOPLE'S D H T IN THEIR BLOOD AGAIN YOU SE THAT IT'S REDUCED BY FIFTY PER CENT HOWEVER AT INCREASING DOSAGES OF POINT TWO MILIGRAMS ONE MILIGRAMS FIVE MILIGRAMS OF ORAL FINASTERIDE PER DAY OVER THE SAME PERIOD OF TIME THE INCREASE OR I SHOULD SAY THE REDUCTION IN DIHYDRO TO STOSTERONE DOESN'T INCREASE LINEARLY IT'S NOT THAT YOU GO FROM FIFTY PER CENT TO SIXTY PER CENT TO SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT TO A HUNDRED PER CENT WITH EACH INCREASING DOSE IT TAPERS OFF IT CAN FLATTENS OUT IT TENDS TO INCREASE A LIBIT BUT ITS SORT OF A GRADUAL SLOPE INCREASING AS YOU HAD FROM POINT TO MILIGRAMS OUT TO FIVE MILIGRAMS SO WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT GIVEN THAT REDUSING THE H T CAN CAUSE VERY SIDE EFFECT SEXUAL SIDE EFFECTS REDUCTIONS IN EITHER SEXUAL FUNCTION OR SEXUAL DRIVE AS WELL AS OVERALL DRIVE AND MOTIVATION SOMETIMES EVEN SOME DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS THAT EVERYTHING POINTS TO TAKING THE LOWEST EFFECTIVE DOSE OF FINASTERIDE AND STARTING WITH A VERY LO DOSE OF FINASTERIDE BECAUSE LODOSEIS OF FINASTERIDE EVEN AT THAT POINT ZERO ONE MILIGRAMS TAKE AN ORLY DAILY ARE ALREADY LEADING TO A FIFTY PER CENT REDUCTION IN DIHYDRA TOSTOSTERONE AND THEREBY TAKEN FOR A LONG ENOUGH PERIOD OF TIME SHOULD OFFSET HAIRLOSS AND STIMULATE HAIR GROWTH ONE OF THE PROBLEMS HOWEVER IS THAT PEOPLE WILL START TAKING FINASTERIDE AT A LO DOSE U KNOW POINT ONE MILIGRAMS OR POINT TWO MILIGRAMS MAYBE EVEN POINT ZERO ONE MILIGRAMS AND THERE WILL BE A REDUCTION IN THEIR DH T BUT BECAUSE OF THE LONG DURATION OF THAT ANAGEN PHASE THEY DON'T SEE A LOT OF CHANGE IN HAIR GROWTH IN THE FIRST MONTHOR EVEN TWO MONTHS AND SO WHAT THE END UP DOING IS INCREASING THEIR DOSAGE AND THEN THEY START TO SEE HAIR GROWTH BUT THEN THEY START TO EXPERIENCE MORE SIDE EFFECTS NOW THE SIDE EFFECTS OF ORALPHINASTERIDE ARE SERIOUS ENOUGH AND COMMON ENOUGH IN PEOPLE AT TAKE FINASTERIDE THAT THE TOPICAL SOLUTIONS WERE DEVELOPED BUT THEIR TWO ONE NEEDS TO EXERCISE CAUTION BECAUSE IF WE ARE GOING TO TRANSLATE BETWEEN TOPICAL FINASTERIDE AN ORALPHINASTERIDE WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT TOPICAL FINASTERIDE CAN AC CTUALLY MAKE IT INTO THE SYSTEMIC CIRCULATION WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT'S BEEN SHOWN IN CLINICAL STUDIES WHICH IS THAT FOR INSTANCE TAKING ONE MILI LEADER OF POINT TWO FIVE PER CENT FINASTORIDE APPLID TO THE SCAUP THIS IS A VERY TYPICAL RECOMMENDATION TRANSLATES TO THE SAME THING THAT WOULD BE ACHIEVED WITH TWO POINT FIVE MILIGRAMS OF ORAL FINASTORIDE AND WHEN I SAY TRANSLATES TO THE SAME THING WHAT I MEAN AS IT LEADS TO THE SAME CONCENTRATIONS IN THE BLOOD NOW CONSIDER THAT POINT TWO MILIGRAMS POINT TWO MILIGRAMS A FINASTORIDE IN THE BLOOD IS KNOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN GENERATING NEW HAIR GROWTH AND MAINTAINING HAIR THAT ONE ALREADY HAS WHEN THEY START THE TREATMENT SO IF YOU THINK THAT THE TOPICAL FINASTORIDES ARE ACTUALLY CREATING LOWER OVER ALL SYSTEMIC CONCENTRATIONS OF FINASTORIDE THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE AGAIN ONE MILI LEADER OF TOPICAL FINASTRDE AT POINT TWO FIVE PER CENT LEADS TO EIGHT TWO POINT FIVE MILIGRAM CONCENTRATION IN THE BLOOD WHEN THE EFFECTIVE DOSE WITHIN THE BLOOD STREAM BY TAKING IT ORALY AS A PILL IS POINT TWO MILIGRAMS THAT MIGHT NOT SEEM LIKE A BIG DEAL TO YOU ALTHOUGH IT IS A BIG DEAL RIGT RE ICING TWO POINT FIVE MILIGRAMS VERSES POINT TO BUT IT IS A HUGE DEAL WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT THE SIDE EFFECTS A FINASTORIDE INCREASE AS YOU INCREASE THE CONCENTRATION OF FINASTORIDE IN THE BLOOD STREAM SO WHERE DOES THIS LEAVE US SHOULD PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN TAKING FINASTRIDE TAKE THE ORAL FORM AT LODOSE OR TAKE THE TOPICAL FORM AND SIMPLY TRY AND APPLY IT LESS OFTEN OR GUESS AT WHAT THEIR SYSTEMIC CONCENTRATION OF FINASTORIDE IS WELL IT'S GOING TO VARY FROM PERSON AF PERSON SOME PEOPLE ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO FINASTORIDE AND NOT IN THE GOOD SENSE THE SIDE EFFECTS JUST REALLY SHOW UP QUICKLY AND THEY TEND TO BE DRAMATIC OTHER PEOPLE NOT SO MUCH THE DOSAS RECOMMENDATIONS THAT I WAS ABLE TO ARRIVE AT BASED ON THE CLINICAL STUDIES AND FRANKLY IN DISCUSSION WITH SOME DOCTORS WHO PRESCRIBE FINASTORIDE WE'RE THE FOLLOWING POINT FIVE MILIGRAMS TO ONE MILIGRAM OF FINASTE RIDE AS A TABLET PER DAY SEEMS TO BE AN EFFECTIVE AND PRETTY SAFE STARTING PLACE FOR MOST PEOPLE NOW SOME PEOPLE WILL FIND THAT EVEN THAT POINT FIVE MELEGRAM DOSAGE IS JUST GOING TO CASSIDE EFFECTS THAT ARE NOT GOING TO WORK FOR THEM AND THEY'RE GOING TO EITHER AFTER REDUCE THEIR DOSAGE OF FINASTERIDE OR MOVE TO THE TOPICAL OR MAY BE CEASE TAKING FINASTERIDE ALTOGETHER BUT FOR MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT'S GOING TO BE PRETTY WELL TOLERATED THE KEYTHING HERE IS THAT ONE IS GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT SOME PERIOD OF TIME TO SEE WHETHER NOT ANY HAIR GROWTH OCCURS IT IS A NAIVE AND FRANKLY FOOLISH APPROACH BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE DURATION OF THAT ANAGEN PHASE OF THE HAIR TO DO ONE OF THESE TREATMENTS WAIT A WEEK OR TWO AND THEN DECIDE TO UP YOUR DOSE NOW IT IS NOT FOOLISH TO REDUCE YOUR DOSE IF YOU'RE EXPERIENCING BAD SIDE EFFECTS BUT TIS SIMPLY INCREASE YOUR DOSE BECAUE YOU'RE NOT GETTING RESULTS QUICKLY ENOUGH THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE BEST APPROACH IE REALLY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO EXPLORE THE FINASTRIDE ROUTE TO THINK OF THIS AS A LONG TERM PROJECT AND TO REALLY RATCHIT UP SLOWLY IF AT ALL STARTING INITIALLY WITH A LOW DOSE TAKEN FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME MAY BE EVEN AS LONG AS TWENTY FIVE WEEKS BEFORE CONSIDERING GOING UP ANY FURTHER CERTAINLY AS I MENTION BEFORE IF YOU NEED TO GO DOWN FURTHER THAT'S NOT GONG TO BE A PROBLEM LEAST NOT IN TERMS OF REDUCING SIDE EFFECTS SHOME YOU'R NOT KINGTO GET ADDITIONAL HAIR GROWTH BUT IS SURENLY NOT GOING TO INCREASE YOUR SIE EFFECTS IF YOU REDUCE YOUR DOSE HOWEVER I WILL TALK A LITTLBIT LATER ABOUT POST FINASTERIDE CYNDRUM WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT'S GETTING INCREASING ATTENTION NOWADAYS THAT SOMETHING THAT OCCURS AFTER PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN FINASTERIDE FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME NOW SOME OF YOU OF PERHAPS HEARD AND I'LL JUST TELL YOU RIHT HERE THAT THE TOPICAL FORMS OF FINASTERIDE ARE ASSOCIATED WITH FAR LESS SIDE EFFECTS NOW THAT MIGHT COME AS SURPRISING GIVEN THAT TOPICAL APPLICATION OF FINASTERIDE CAN LEAD TO SYSTEMIC DISTRIBUTION OF FINASTRIDE BUT THE NUMBERS THAT ARE OUT THERE RIGHT NOW IT'S THAT TOPICAL FINASTRIDE IS ASSOCIATED WITH THIRTY TO FIFTY PER CENT FEWER SIDE EFFECTS OR THIRTY TO FIFTY PER CENT LESS SEVERE SIDE EFFECTS THAN ORAL FINASTORIDE NOW THEY'RE SEVERAL THINGS PROBABLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT ONE IS THAT PEOPLE TEND TO RACHUT UP THEIR DOSE OF ORAL FINASTERIDE PRETTY QUICKLY BUT KEEP IN MIND THAT THE EFFECTIVE DOSE OF FINASTERIDE IN THE BLOOD IS POINT TWO MILIGRAMS NOW EARLIER I SAID THE TYPICAL TOPICAL FINASTERIDE SOLUTIONS ARE POINT TO FIVE PER CENT PEOPLE TAKEN ONE MIL OF IT THAT IT TWO POINT FIVE MILIGRAMS AND SO IT SEEMS LIKE A MASIVE OVERDOSING AH BUT HERE'S THE DISCREPANCY AND HERE'S WHERE WE CAN ARRIVE AT SOME REASONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS IF YOU DECIDE THAT FINASTERIDESRITE FOR YOU YOU GET A PRESCRIPTION I WOULD HOPE THAT YOUR MONOR DURING YOUR D H T LEVELS AND OTHER HORMON LEVELS THAT WOULD BE IDEAL AND WORKING WITH A DOCTOR PLEASE POINT FIVE MILIGRAMS TO ONE MILIGRAM PER DAY OF ORAL FINASTERIDE SEEMS TO BE THE BEST STARTING PLACE FOR TOPICAL FINASTERIDE IT'S GOING TO BE THAT ONE MIL LEADER A POINT TWO FIVE PER CENT THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER BUT THAT'S TAKEN ONLY ONE TIME PER WEEK AND YOU CAN FULLY EXPECT THAT RIHTE AFTER THE APPLICATION YOU WILL HAVE HIGHER LEVELS O FINASTERIDE IN YOUR BLOODSTREAM AND THEREFORE LOWER LEVELS OF T H T AND THAT THAT WILL ALTER ACROSS THE WEEK MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO MEASURE THEIR D H T ON A DAY BY DAY OR EVEN WEEKLY BASIS IS JUST TO EXPENSIVE AND LABOR INTENSIVE BUT I THINK THOSE DOSING REGIMENTS OUGHT TO GET PEOPLE INTO MOR OR LESS THE SAME CATEGORY OF OPTIMIZING HAIR MAINTENANCE AND HAIR GROWTH WHILE MINIMIZING FINASTERIDE SIDE EFFECTS ONE POINT ABOUT FINASTERIDE TAKEN EITHER ALONE OR IN COMMINATION IS THAT IN RECENT YEARS REALLY IN THE LAST FIVE OR SO YEARS THERE'S BEEN INCREASING DISCUSSION ABOUT SO CALLED POST FINASTERIDE CINDRUM NOW POST FINASTRIDE CINDRUM IS INDEED A NEW PHENOMENON IN THE SENSE THAT FINASTERIDE HAS BEEN PERSCRIBED FOR A VERY LONG PERIOD OF TIME FOUR TREATMENT OF THE PROSTATE AT DOSAGES OF ABOUT FIVE MILIGRAMS PER DAY THAT'S A VERY HIGH DOSE SOMETIMES LOWER BUT AS HIGH AS FIVE MILIGRAMS PER DAY AND FOR MANY YEARS THERE WAS NO DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS POST FINASTERIDE CINDRUM WHAT IS POST FINAS STRIDE CYNDRUM POST FINASTRIDE CYNDRUM IS WHEN TYPIALLY ITS MALES THIS IS WHERE IT'S BEEN DESCRIBED WILL TAKE FINASTRIDE AT ANY RANGE OF DOSAGES FROM ONE MELIGRAM TO FIVE MELIGRAMS PER DAY THEIRE EITHEIR DOING THIS FOR PROSTATE OR MORE LIKELY THEIR DOING IT TO OFFSET HAIRLOSS AN INCREASE HAIR GROWTH AND THEN THEY STOP TAKING FINASTORIDE FOR WHATEVER REASON FINANCIAL OR WASN'T WORKING FOR THEM WHERE THE SIDE EFFECTS WERE NOT TO THEIR LIKING AND THEY START TO EXPERIENCE SOME VERY SEVERE WHAT CAN ONLY BE CALLED CYNDRUM EF FACTS SUCH AS VERY REDUCED LEBIDO VERY REDUCED ERECTILE FUNCTION VERY REDUCED MOOD TO THE POINT OF DEPRESSION EVEN SUICIDAL DEPRESSION SO THIS IS PRETTY SCARY STUFF ESPECIALLY SINCE IT'S OCCURRING AT AN AGE WHEN MOST OF THESE THINGS ARE NOT TYPICALLY OCCURRING IN MALES THEY CANICER BUT THEY'RE NOT TYPICAL OF YOUNGER MALES AN THEIR TWENTIES AND THIRTIES AND EARLY FORTIES SO WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES WHAT'S GOING ON HERE AFTER ALL PEOPLE V TAKEN FINASTRIDE FOR THE PROSTATE AND FAIRLY HYDOSAGES WITHOUT THIS POSTFINASTRIDE CYNDRUM WHEN THEY'VE STOPPED NOW THESE YOUNG MALES ARE TAKING FINASTORIDE THEIR OMING OFFINASTRIDE IN THEIR GETTING THIS VERY SEVERE VERY DEBILITATING POSTFINASTRIDE CYNDRUM THIS HAS BECOME A KIND OF HOT TOPIC ENOUGH SO THAT MEDICAL DOCTORS WHOAVE BEEN PRESCRIBING FINASTRIDE FOR VERY LONG TIME HAVE BEEN FORCED TO ADDRESS THIS I THINK AT FIRST THEY WERE SOR PERPLEXED AN THOUGHT I DON'T KNOW THIS MIGHT BE PSYCHOSEMATIC WHENEVER THAT MEANS M AS THE NORCIENTIST WHO WORKS ON MIND MIDY CONNECTION WE KNOW THAT NOTHING IS TRULY PCYCHOSANATIC EVERYTHING IS OF THE MIND AND BODY BUT THE POINT IS THAT ENOUGH MEDICAL ATTENTION HAS BEEN PLACED ON POSTFINASTORIDE CYNDRUM AND TRYING TO UNRAVEL EXACTLY WHAT THAT IS WHERE THERE ARE NOW A FEW GENERAL CONCLUSIONS ABOUT WHAT MIGHT BE GOING ON FIRST OF ALL IT SEEMS THAT YOUNGER MALES TAKING FINASTRIDE IN PARTICULAR HYDOSAGES TO IMPROVE HAIRGROWTH OR OFFSET HAIRLOSS SEEMS TO BE ONE OF THE KEY VARIABLES WERE NOT SEEING THIS POSTFINASTRIDE CYNDRUM AS MUCH IN OLDER MALES IN FACT IT SEEMS TO OCCUR MORE IN MALES AND THEIR TWENTIES AND THIRTIES THAN MALES IN THEIR FORTIES AND OLDER SO THAT'S ONE THING IN IT MAY RELATE TO THE WAYS IN WHICH DIHYDROTISTOSTRONE WE KNOW HAS A VERY KEY ROLL IN EARLY EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT ITS ATUU WHAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MALE GENITALIA IT'S ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR CERTAIN THINGS IN FEMALE DEVELOPMENT BUT MAINLY IN UTERO ITS RESPONSIBLE FOR MALE DEVELOPMENT AND DEVELOPMENT THE PENUS IN PARTICULAR AND THEN A ROUND THE TIME OF PUBRITY DIHYDROTISTOSTRONE ACTS AGAIN IN WHAT'S CALLED ITS ACTIVATING EFFECTS TO FURTHER INCREASE GROWTH OF THE GENITALIA INCREASE THE MUSCULATURE BONE GROWTH ET CETERA ND INCREASED LEBEDO AND A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS IT'S PROBABLY ALSO INVOLVED IN THE ACTIVATION OF PUBERITY IT CERTAINLY NOT THE ONLY HORMONE INVOLVED IN THE ACTIVATION OF MALE PUBRITY BUT IT' CERTAINLY ONE OF THE KEY PLAYERS SO DIHYDRATISTOSTRONE HAS THESE KNOWN EARLY ROLLS IN EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT AND IMPUBERTY BUT WHAT POSTPHINASTRIDE CYNDRUM SEEMS TO INDICATE IS THAT DIHYDROTISTSTRONE IS LIKELY HAVING FURTHER EFFECTS ON MALE MATURATION IN PARTICULAR NATURATION OF THE HYPOFHALMUS AND AREAS OF THE BRAIN THAT CONTINUE WELL INTO ONE'S TWENTIES AND MAY BE EVEN ONE'S THIRTIES AND HERE I JUST WANT EVERYONE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT WE TEND TO THINK ABOUT DEVELOPMENT AS CHILDHOOD TEEN AE YEARS YOUNG ADULOPHOOD ADULTHOOD BUT REALLY DEVELOPMENT NEVER STOPS DEVELOPMENT AS SOMETHING THAT STARTS AT CONCEPTION AND BIRTH OF COURSE AND THEN EXTENDS ALL THE WAY OUT INTIL THE  POINT WHEN WE DIE SO EVEN IF WE LIVE TO BE IN OUR LATE NINETIES ORE ACHIEVE A HUNDRED YEARS OF AGE DEVELOPMENT IS A CURRING THAT ENTIRE TIME AND THESE DIFFERENT HORMONES SUCH AS DIHYDROTISTOSTRONE ARE HAVING DIFFERENT IMPACT FOR ACROSS THE LIFE SPAN AND IN DIFFERENT WAYS ACROSS THE LIFE SPAN SO THERE ISN'T A CLEAR CONCLUSION ABOUT WHAT POST FANASTERIDE CYNDRUM IS REALLY ALL ABOUT BUT IT POINTS TO THEFACT THAT D H C IS LIKELY TO BE INVOLVED IN DEVELOPMENT OF THE BRAIN N THE BRAIN TO GENITAL AXIS BECAUSE I MENTION THAT BECAUSE SO MANY OF THE SIDE EFFECTS THAT AR ASSOCIATE WITH THIS POSTFINASTRISED INTRUM SEEM TO CENTER ON SEXUAL SIDE EFFECTS ALTHOUGH THEIR ALSO THE DEPRESSIVE SIDE EFFECTS OF COURSE THOSE CAN BE RELATED TO ONE ANOTHER IN EITHER DIRECTION SO WHILE I DO UNDERSTAND THAT LOSS OF ONE'S HAIR OR POTENTIAL LOSS OF ONE'S HAIR CAN BE PARTICULARLY TROUBLING AND ANXIETY PROVOKING EVEN CAUSE DEPRESSION IN SOME CASES I AM SENSITIVE TO THAT YOU ALSO ON TO BE SENDS ITIVE TO THE FACT THAT SOME OF THESE TREATMENTS SUCH AS FIANASTORIDE CAN CARRY VERY SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS EVEN IF YOU COME OFF THEM H A A POSTPINASTORIDE CINDRUM AS LONG AS WE'RE TALK ABOUT FINASTORIDE AND THIS GENERAL PATHWAY OF FIVE ALOREDUCTASTE IN IBITION AND THEREBY D  C INIBITION  ON ON TOPICS AND THEMES AND NOMINCLATURE YOU ARE NOW VERY FAMILIAR WITH WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT DO TASTORIDE DO TASTORIDE IT IS YET ANOTHER MOLECULE SIMILAR TO FINASTORIDE BUT REMEMBER THOSE THREE ICAFORMS OF THE FIVE ALFOREDUCTA SENS ON WELL IT INHIBITS ALL THREE MAINLY TYPE ONE INTYPE TWO BUT ALSO TYPE THREE AND IT DOES IT VERY POTENTLY SO AS A CONSEQUENCE THE TYPICAL DOSAGE OF ORL DO TASTORIDE GET THIS POINT FIVE MILIGRAMS TO TWO POINT FIVE MILIGRAMS TAKEN ORDERLY WORKS TWO TO FIVE TIMES FASTOR THEN TYPICAL FINASTORIDE AT INDUCING HAIR REGROWTH AND REDUCES D H T BY GET THIS NINETY FIVE PER CENT  JUST NEAR FLAT LINES D H T AND THAT CAN OCCUR AT CONCENTRATIONS AS LOWAST POINT FIVE MILIGRAMS ALTHOUGH YOU WILL SEE PRESCRIPTIONS AND PEOPLE TAKING DO TASTORIDE ANYWHERE FROM POINT FIVE MILIGRAMS ALTHEGH AY TO TWO POINT FIVE MILIGRAMS ORALY NOW NOT SURPRISINGLY DO TASTORIDE IS ASSOCIATED WITH A LOT OF SIDE EFFECTS RELATE TO THE D H T PATHWAY SO THINGS LIKE REDUCTION IN SECT STORIVE REDUCTION AND OVER ALL DRIDE IT ALSO TENDS TO IMPACT OTHER HORMONE PATHWAYS SO INCREASES AN ESTUOGEN PROLACTIN THAT'S WHY GANOCHOMNASTIA MAL GROWTH OF MAL BREAST TISSUE SOMETIMES OCCURS WHEN PEOPLE TAKE DO TASTORIDE AND SO YOU'RE PROBABLY ASKING WHY WOULD ANY ONE TAKE DO TASTORIDE WHY NOT JUST TAKE FINASTORIDE AND WAIT FOR THAT HAIR GROWTH WELL ANSER IS THAT PEOPLE ARE OFTEN VERY IMPATIENT AND IT TURNS OUT THAT DO TA STERIDE WORKS ABOUT TWO TO FIVE TIMES FASTER THAN FINASTORIDE SO SOME PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO WEIGHT O FULL THIRTY WEEKS OR FORTY WEEKS OR FIFTY WEKS OR MORE IN ORDER TO GROW THEIR HAIR BACK AND THEIR VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE HIR LOSS THAT'S OCCURRING SO THEY WILL TAKE WHAT I HOPE WOULD BE A VERY LOW DOSE OF DO TASTORIDE I REALIZE THAT THERE ARE ARWAYS TO TAKE DUTASTRIDE THAT CAN BE SAFER OFFSET SOME OF THESE SIDE EFFECTS BUT BY MY READ OF THE LITERATURE IF ONE IS GOING TO TRY TO MILDLY INHIVIT THAT H H T PATHWAY THINGS LIKE SAL PALMETTO THINGS LIKE TOPICAL CAFFINE WHICH HAS SOME EFFECT ON THE ANDURGEN PATHWAY BUT AS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER TICKLES OTHER PATHWAYS THINGS LIKE QITOCONISAL MILD REDUCTION IN ANDURGEN RECEPTOR PATHWAYS IN THE PHOLICAL AND VERY DIRECT BECAUSE IT SUPPLY DIRECTLY THE SCALP THINGS LIKE THAT ARE GOING TO BE THE BASTOROUT FOR MILD REDUCTIONS IND H T AS AN ATTEMPT TO MAINTAIN HAIR OR GROW HAIR WHEREAS IF ONE REALLY WANTS A POTENT STIMULUS FOR INCREASING HAIR GROWTH THAT'S VERY LIKELY GOING TO BE FINASTORIDE AND HOPEFULLY LOW ENOUGH DOSEGES OF FINASTORIDE AND HOPEFULLY A PATIENT ENOUGH PATIENT PERSON THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO WAIT THE DURATION OF TIME REQUIRED FOR THAT HAIR GROWTH TO COME BACK BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THAT ANURGEN PHASE TAKE SOME TIME NOW THE HOLY GRAIL OF ALL THIS HAIR STUFF IS IN UNDERSTANDING THAT NO ONE SPECIFIC TREATMENT IS MAGIC AND IN FACT THERE ARE NOW A NUMBER OF GOOD MEDAANALYSIES COMPARING THE VARIOUS TREATMENTS WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY ALONE OR IN COMBINATION AND WE CAN SUMRISE THAT PRETTY EASILY BY SAYING THAT COMMINATION TREATMENTS THAT INVOLVE A MECHANICAL STIMULUS AND A CHEMICAL STIMULUS ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE BETTER THAN EITHER ONE ALONE AND WITHIN THE MECHANICAL CATEGORY THE STIMULUS THAT SEEMS TO WORK BEST IS MICRO NEEDLING SO THE COMMINATION OF MICRO NEEDLING AND FINASTORIDE CAN LEAD TO SOME PRETTY ROBOST AND IMPRESSIVE HAIR REGROWTH SO MUCH SO THAT PEOPLE THAT WERE I CA WE'D ONLY DESCRIBE THEM AS PRETTY BALD OR BALD CAN REGROW SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF HAIR I'VE NEVER SEEN EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE WHO WERE COMPLETELY BALLED MEANING LACKING ALL SCAL HAIR TO GROW BACK A FULL HEADE OF HAIR BUT THE COMMINATION OF MICRO NEEDLING AND FINASTERIDE IS PROBABLY THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO GO AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT THERE'S NO REASON WHY YOU COULDN'T ALSO USE K TO CONOSAL SHAMPOO COULD ALSO U SALT PALMETTO THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK THAT THESE THINGS COLLIE WITH ONE ANOTHER ALTHOUGH ANY TIME YOU'RE INHIBITING A D H T PATHWAY OR WHETHER NOT YOUR INCREASING OR DCREASING ANY HORMONE PATHWAY FOR THAT MATTER YOU ANE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT LAYERING IN TOO MANY DIFFERENT TREATMENTS BECAUSE YOU DO'T WANT YOUR  H  LEVEL TO GO TOO LOW AND LET'S KEEP IN MIND THAT EVEN IF YOU TAKE A VERY LODOSE OF FINASTERIDE AND REDUCE YOUR D H T AND DON'T HAVE SIDE EFFECTS MAYBE JUST THE MERE EDITION OF SAL PALMETTO WHICH LEADS TO A SLIGHT REDUCTION IN D H T COMBINE WITH SOME CAFFINE OINTMENT WOULD BE SUFFICIENT ENOUGH TO START INDUCING SOME OF THE LO D H T ASSOCIATED SIDE EFFECTS SO YOU REALLY HAVE TO C FOR YOU AND THAT'S ONE OF THE MAJOR ISSUES IN THIS WHOLE FIELD OF HAIR GROWTH AND REGROWTH IS THAT PEOPLE ARE HIGHLY INDIVIDUAL IN THEIR RESPONSE AND IN THEIR SIDE EFFECT PROFILE TO THESE VARIOUS TREATMENTS BOT THERE'S AN ENORMOUS RANGE THERE AND UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S NO WAY TO KNOW A PRIORI BEFORE DOING THESE TREATMENTS WHAT YOUR RESPONSE IS GOING TO B IN TERMS OF SIDE EFFECTS O YOUR SIMPLY CAN HAVE TO EXPLORE AND I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU WOULD EXPLORE STARTING WITH MINIMAL POSSIBLE EFFECTIVE DOSAGES AND TO DO THAT INCORDINATION WITH A MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS SO YOU COULD REALLY EVALUATE THESE THINGS THAT THE LEVEL OF BLOOD AND COSMATIC CHANGES AND IN FACT THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD MODEIV AITOR FOR THINKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENT TREATMENTS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY EVERYTHING FROM MECHANICAL TREATMENTS A SIMPLE AS MISSAGE WHICH WEVE ALL HURT ABOUT BUT FOR WHICH THE REALLY AREN'T A LOT OF DATA FOR SUPPORTING HAIR GROWTH BUT CERTAINLY THINGS LIKE MICRO NEEDLING WHICH IS A MECHANICAL STIMULUS FOR WHICH THERE ARE PRETTY GOOD DATA THAT IT CAN IMPROVE HAIR GROWTH ALSO THINGS LIKE SAL PALMETTO A WEAK D H T ANTAGONIST ALSO THINGS LIKE KITOCANOSAL CHAMPOO WHICH AGAIN IS A WEAK T H T ANTAGONIST AND OPERATES THROUGH SOME OTHER PATHWAYS IS WELL TO STIMULATE HAIR GROWTH MY SUGGESTION IS THAT ANY ONE YOUNG OLD MALE FEMALE WHOE THINK ING ABOUT EMBARKING ON VARIOUS TREATMENTS FOR OFFSETTING HAIR LOSS AND STIMULATING HAIR GROWTH CONSIDER BOTH MECHANICAL APPROACHES END THE APPROACHES THAT ATTACK THE CHEMICAL PATHWAYS THAT CAN STIMULATE HAIR GROWTH AND CAN INHIBIT THE INHIBITORS OF HAIR GROWTH IN FACT THAT'S THE REASON WHY WE SPEND SO MUCH TIME ON THE BIOLOGY OF HAIR GROWTH AND WHAT SHUTS DOWN HAIR GROWTH EARLY ON INTO DAY'S EPISODE AND THEN SYSTEMATICALLY WENT THROUGH EACH OF THE VARIOUS TREATMENTS THAT RELIES ON AND IN SOME CASES INGES ENTIRELY ON EITHER A MECHANICAL STIMULUS OR A CHEMICAL STIMULUS IN ORDER TO EXERT ITS EFFACTS MY GOAL TODAY WAS NOT TO OVERWHELM YOU WITH A TON OF BIOLOGY ABOUT HAIR ALTHOUGH WE DID COVER A LOT OF BIOLOGY OF HAIR AND STEMSELS AND HAIR GROWTH MY GOLAN DESCRIBING ALL THAT WAS REALLY FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO HEARABOUT VARIOUS TREATMENTS BUT THEY'RE NOT ITS LAZERS OR P R P OR FINASTERIDE DO TASTERIDE OR WHATEVER IS COMING NEXT THAT WERE SURE TO HEARABOUT SOON ON LINE AND FROM THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY AND TO BE ABLE TO PLACE THOSE INTO BINS RELATED TO THEIR KNOWN OR POTENTIAL MECHANISMS AND THEN TO BE ABLE TO STEP BACK AND EVALUATE

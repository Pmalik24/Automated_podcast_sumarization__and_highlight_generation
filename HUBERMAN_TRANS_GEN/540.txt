WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LAPONCAS T  A SCIENCE SCIENCE PACE TO  FOR  I MANDUR HUBERMEN AND I'M A PROFESSOR OF NEUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FOR MY TEACHING IND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AN EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTOC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC ALONG THOSE LINES I WANT TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TODAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS ATH LETIC GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND IN TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THE REASEN I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS ON TH REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIGRENS ONCE OR TWICE TO DAY IS THAT HELPS ME COVER ALL OF MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGH HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH OUR VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GOP MICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WIH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSENTALLY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITHOUT LETIC GREENS I GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED AND THE PROBICS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIOM IF YOU LIKE TO TRY ATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY'LL IVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TOO THERE ARE TON OF DAT AND OW SHOWING THAT VITEMEND THREE IS ESSENSIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH EVEN IF WOR GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICIENT INVITEMEN D THREE AND K TOO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CARVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FIVFREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TO TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR AVE TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLE OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLITES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AND ORGANE SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIU MAGNESIUM IND POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOES ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEM CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLITES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IF HYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOU'RE GETTING THE PROPARATIOS OF ELECTROLITES IF YU LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMENT DOK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND YOU'LL GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THEI'RE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT A TRY ELEMEN YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMEN TE DOTCAM SLASH HUBERMEN OKE LET'S GET STARTED TODAY IS EPISODE THROUGH THE PODCAST AND IT IS OFFICE HOURS OFFICE HOURS AS MANY OF YOU KNOW WHERE STUDENTS COME TO THE OFFICE OF THE PROFESSOR SIT DOWN AND ASK QUESTIONS REQUESTING CLARIFICATION ABOUT THINGS THAT WERE CONFUSING OR TO SIMPLY GO DOWN THE ROUT OF EXPLORING A TOPIC WITH MORE DEPTH TAN DETAIL I ASKED FOR YOUR QUESTIONS TO BE LISTED IN THE COMMENT SECTION OF THE PREVIOUS TWO EPISODES OF THE PODCAST ON YOU TWOB AS WELL AS ON INSTROGRAM AND I FIRST OF ALL JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE MANY QUESTIONS THEY ARE EXCELLENT WE READ THEM ALL WE DISTILLED FROM THAT LARGE BACH OF QUESTIONS TO TWO TYPES OF QUESTIONS QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED VERY OFTEN AND WE'RE LIKE VERY OFTEN WITH THELE THUMS UP LIKE TAB AS WELL AS QUESTIONS THAT WE THOUGHT COULD REALLY EXPAND ON THE TOPICS THAT WEVE COVERED PREVIOUSLY AND TO DAY WERE WE ARE GOING TO COVER BOTH OF THOSE IF WE DID NOT GET YOUR QUESTION PLEASE A DON'T DESPAIR WE WILL KEEP TRACK OF THOSE AND WE HAVE SEVERAL MORE EPISODES DEVOTED TO THIS TOPIC OF SLEEP AND WAKEFULNESS AND LEARNING DURING THE MONTH OF JANUARY MAYBE EVEN A OU NO LEAKING OVERLOBIT INTO THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY SO WE HAVE TIME THAT'S ONE OF THE UNIQUE FORMATS OF THIS PODCAST IS THAT WE HAVE TIME FOR DIALOGUE WE HAVE TIME FOR YOUR QUESTIONS AND WE HAVE TIME TO REALLY GO DEEP INTO THESE TOPICS IT'S OFFICIAL COSTELLO SLEEPING IN THE BACKGROUND SO IF YOU HEAR SNORING UM COSTELLO IS GOINGTO BE KEEPING TIME A WITH IS A DEEP AND MELODIC SNORING THERE GOES SO THE QUESTIONS THAT WE RECEIVED I BATCHED CRUDELY INTO A COUPLE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES LIGHT EXERCISE SUPPLEMENTATION TEMPERATURE LEARNING PLASTICITY AND MOVD AND SORT OF MOOD RELATED DISORDERS THE RELOTIC QUESTIONS ABOUT THOSE BEFORE WE BEGIN ANY OF THIS I WANT TO POINT OUT SOMETHING THAT I I ALWAYS SAY IT SOUNDS LIKE BOILER PLATE BUT IT'S IMPORTANT NOTJUS TO PROTECT ME BUT TO PROTECT YOU WHICH IS THAT I AM NOT A PHYSICION I'M NOT A MEDICAL DOCTOR I DON'T PROSCRIBE ANYTHING INCLUDING BEHAVIOR O PROTOCOLS I'M A PROFESSOR SO I PROFESS A LOT OF THINGS BASED ON QUALITY PURE REVIEWED STUDIES YOU SHOULD TAKE THAT INFORMATION YOU SHOULD FILTER IT THROUGH WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU CURRENTLY HAPPEN TO BE DEALING WITH WHETHER NOT THAT'S HEALTH OR ILLNESS YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH A LICENHELF CARE OF PROFESSIONAL BEFORE YOU ADD OR REMOVE ANYTHING FROM YOUR DAILY LIFE PROTOCOL I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR HEALTH YOU ARE SO BE SMART WITH THIS INFORMATION AND BE A STRINGENT FILTER AS WE SAY OK VERY WELL LET'S GET STARTED ON THE ACTUAL MATERIAL SOMEBODY ASKED WHAT IS THE ROLL OF MOONLIGHT AND FIRE AM PRESUMING THEY MEAN FIREPLACE OR CANDLE OR THINGS OF THAT SORT IN SETTING CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS IS IT O K TO VI OU MOONLIGHT AT NIGHT OR WILL THAT WAKE ME UP WILL A FIRE IN MY FIREPLACE OR USING CANDLE LIGHT BE TOO MUCH LIGHT GREAT QUESTION ALSO OFFERS ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH YOU WHAT I THINK AS A QUITE BEAUTIFUL DEFINITION OF WHAT LIGHT IS IN A QUANTITATIVE SENSE SO I'VE MENTION A FEW TIMES THE USE OF OF APS AND LIGHT METERS AND THINGS TO MEASURE THINGS LIKE LUCKS WHICH SOMETIMES ARE ALSO DESCRIBED IN TERMS OF TENDELLAS SO THOSE OFE THE TWO UNITS FOR MEASURING LIGHT INTENSITY TYPICALLY LUCKS ELL YOU ACTS IS IT IS THE UNIT AND SO BEFORE WE GO FORWARD AND DISCUSS THIS MANY LUCKS OR THAT MANY LUCKS I WANTED JUST TELL YOU WHAT A LUCKS IS BECAUSE IT RELAHTES TO THIS QUESTION ONE LUCKS EQUALS THE ILLUMINATION OF ONE SQUARE METER SURFACE AT ONE METER AWAY FROM A SINGLE CANDLE BUT THAT I SO SOMEBODY ACTUALLY DECIDED AT SOME POINT THAT THE AMOUNT OF ILLUMINATION AT ONE SQUARE METER SURFACE ONE METER AWAY FROM A SINGLE CANDLE THAT EQUALS ONE LUCKS SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SIX THOUSAND LUCKS OF LIGHT INTENSITY OR TEN THOUSAND LUCKS OF LIGHT INTENSITY NOW YOU HAVE A KIND OF REFERENCE ARE A FRAME WORK THAT WOULD BE THE EQUIVALENT OF YOU COULD THINK OF IT AS SIX THOUS IN CANDLES ALL WITH THEIR LIGHT INTENSITY SHOWN ON ONE SQUARE METER FROM ONE METERS DISTANCE AWAY OR OF COURSE IF IT WAS A DIFFERENT NUMBER OF LUCKS IT WOULD B A DIFFERENT NUMBER OF CANDLES SO YOU GET THE IDEA HERE'S THE GREAT THING TURNS OUT THAT MOONLIGHT CANDLE LIGHT AND EVEN A FIREPLACE IF YOUHAV ONE OF THESE ROARING FIRES GOING IN THE FIREPLACE DO NOT RESET YOUR CIRCADEAN CLOCK AT NIGHT IN TRICK YOUR BRAIN INTO THINKING THAT ITS MORNING EVEN THOUGH IF YOU'VE EVER SAT CLOSE TO A FIREPLACE OR EVEN A CANDLE THAT LIGHT SEEMS VERY BRIGHT AND THERE TWO REASONS FOR THAT THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT THE FIRST ONE IS THAT THESE NURONS IN YOUR EYE THAT A DISCUSS IN THE PREVIOUS EPISODE THESE MELONOPS AN GANGLIAN CELLS ALSO CALLED INTRINSICALLY PHOTOSENSITIVE GANGLIAN CELLS THOSE CELLS ADJUST THEIR SENSITIVITY ACROSS THE DAY AND THOSE CELLS RESPOND BEST TO THE BLUE YELLOW CONTRAST PRESENT IN THE RISING AND SETTING SUN SO CALLD LOSOL OR ANGLE SUN ALSO DISCUSSED IN THE PREVIOUS EPISODE BUT THOSE CELLS ADJUST THEIR SENSITIVITY SUCH THAT THEY WILL NOT ACTIVATE THE THE TRIGGERS IN THE BRAIN THAT CONVEY DAYTIME SIGNALS WHEN THEY VIEW MOONLIGHT EVEN A FULL MOON ARE REALLY BRIGHT MOON OR FIRE NOW THIS DOES RAISE AN INTERESTING KIND OF THOUGHT POINT WHICH IS TAT YOU KNOW LOT OF PEOPLE TALK T ABOUT LUNACE IN THE FACT THAT WHEN THERE'S A FULL MOON OUT PEOPLE ACT DIFFERENTLY AND BEHAVE DIFFERENTLY AH THERE'S A LOT OF LORE AROUND THAT THERE'S ACTULY A LITTLE BIT OF QUALITY SCIENCE AROUND THAT THAT MAY WE CAN ADDRESS IN THE FUTURE BUT YOU KNOW MOONLIGHT IS TYPICALLY NOT GOING TO WAKE US UP TOO MUCH EXCEPT MAYBE IF THE MOON IS IS REALLY FULL AND REALLY BRIGHT THERE'S POSSIBILITY FOR THAT SO PROVIDING Y N NOCKING TO BURN DOWN THE STRUCTURE YOU'REIN AND I CAN BURN DOWN THE FOREST ENJOYYOR YOUR FIREPLACES ENJOYYOR A YOUR LIGHTS FROM CANDLES AND THOSE ARE PERFECTLY SAFE WITHOUT DISTRUPTING YOUR CIRCATIANG RHYTHM BECAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT JUST HOW CRUCIAL IT IS TO AVOID BRIGHT LIGHTS BETWEEN THE HOURS OF ABOUT TEN PIM AND FOR IM EXCEPT WHEN YOU NEED TO VIEW THINGS FOR SAKE OF SAFETY WORE A OR WORK OR SO AND SO FORTH I'L SO RECEIVED A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT RED LIGHT W I THINK I WAS ASKED THOSE QUESTIONS BECAUSE RED LIGHT IS USED IN A NUMBER DIFFERENT COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS WHERE THESE PRODUCTS TAN TO INCLUDE A SHEET A VERY BRIGHT RED LIGHTS THAT ONE IS SUPPOSED TOF VIEW EARLY IN THE DAY AND THERE ARE VARIOUS CLAIMS ATTACHED TO THESE RED LIGHT DEVICES THAT THEY IMPROVE MY TO CONDREAL FUNCTIONIN THAT THEY IMPROVE MENTABOLISM THERE'S A I'MAN TO BE REALLY HONEST A AND I CANT NAME BRANS AND I A NOT CIN TAE NAME PARTICULAR STUDIES CAUSE WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY ABOUT THESE STUDIESES AM NOT PARTICULARLY AM UNKIND BUT LET'S JUST SAY THAT NONE OF THE STUDIES THAT I'VE SEEN EXCEPT FOR ONE THAT I'LL TALK ABOUT A MOMENT POINTING TO THE PAUSIVE EFFECTS OF RED LIGHT ON THE VISUAL SYSTEM ARE PUBLISHED IN BLUE RIBBON JOURNALS THEY TEND TO BE PUBLISH IN JOURNALS THAT A IDO WORK HARD TO FIND AM I'M NOT SURE WATH THE PURE REVIEW IN STRINGENCY LEVEL IS NOW THAT'S NOT TO SAY RED LIGHT IS IN BENEFICIAL BECAUSE THERE IS ONE STUDY IN PARTICULAR THAT CAME FROM GLEN JEFFREY'S LAB AT THE UNIVERSYA COLLEGE LONDON IT WAS PUBLISHD LAST YEAR GLEN IS SOMEBODY I HAPPEN TO KNOW ITHE EXCELLENT REPUTATION EXCELLENT VISION SCIENTISTS WHAT THI STUDY ESSENTIALLY SHOWED AND AGAIN THIS IS A STUDY THAT I I VERY MUCH LIKE THE DATA AND THINK IT WAS DONE VERY HIGH STANDARDS WHAT THE STUDY SHOWS IS THAT VIEWING RED LIGHT FOR A FEW MINUTES EACH MORNING CAND HAVE POUSIVE EFFECTS ON MITA CONDRIA IN A PARTICULAR RETINAL CELL TYPE THAT TENDS TO DEGENERATE OR DECLINING FUNCTION WITH AGE IN HUMANS AND THAT SELLTYPE IS THE PHOTO RECEPTOR THE PHOTO RECEPTER IS A TYPE OF CELL IN YOUR EYE THAT SITS AT THE BACK OF THE EYTS AND OF SOME DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE GANGLING CELLS AND IT'S THE THE SELL THAT CONVERTS LIGHT INFORMATION INTO ELECTRICAL SIGNALS THAT THE REST OF THE RETINA AND BRAIN CAN UNDERSTANMD THESE ARE VITALLY IMPORTANT CELLS WITHOUT THEM PEOPLE ARE BLIND AND MANY PEOPLE'S VISION GETS WORSE WITH AGE IN PARTICULAR AGERLE MACULAR DEGENERATION BUT ALSO RELATED TO SOME OTHER FACTORS INCLUDING PHOTORIS RECEPTOR A FUNCTIONALITY JUS GAIN WORSE WITH TIME AND WHAT GLEN SHOWED WAS THAT RED LIGHT FLASHES DELIVERED IN PARTICULAR EARLY IN THE DAY BUT NOT LATE IN THE DAY CAN HELP REPAIR THE MITOCHONDREA NOW THIS STUDY NEEDS MORE A SUPPORT UM FROM ADDITIONAL STUDIES OF COURSE A THEY ARE DUING A CLINICAL TRIAL THEY DID REPORT ON WHAT I I THINK IT WAS TWELVE PATIENTS AM AND SO THE WORK IS ON GOING BUT THAT WAS VERY INTERESTING A AND IT POINTS TO SOME PERTENTIALLY REALLY USEFUL THINGS ABO UT RED LIGHT HOWEVER MOST OF THE QUESTIONS I GOT ABOUT RED LIGHT FOR SAKE OF OFFICE HOURS WERE ABOUT THE USE OF RED LIGHT LATER IN THE DAY SO HERE'S THE DEAL INPRINCIPLE RED LIGHT WE'LL NOT STIMULATE THE MELENOPS IN RETINAL NURONS THAT WAKE UP THE BRAIN AND CIRCADEAN CLOCK AND SIGNAL DAYTIME HOWEVER MOST OF THE RED LIGHTS IN PARTICULAR THE RED LIGHTS THAT COME ON THESE SHEETS OF THESE PRODUCTS THAT PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO VIEW THEM A IN ORDER TO AC ESS A NUMBER OF A YOU KNOW PROCLAIMED HEALTH EFFACTS THOSE ARE WAY TO BRIGHT AND WOULD DEFINITELY WAKE UP YOUR BODY IND BRAIN SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE THOSE PRODUCTS AND I'M NOT SUGGESTING YOU DO OR YOU DON'T BUT IF IF THAT'S YOUR THING YOUWOULD WON'T USE THOSE EARLY IN THE DAY WHO KNOWS YOU MIGHT EVEN DERIVE SOME BENEFIT ON MITACHONDREO FUNCTION IN THESE PHOTORECEPTORS BUT IF YOU WERE THINKING ABOUT RED LIGHT FORSAKE OF AVOIDING THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF LIGHT LATER IN THE DAY AND AT NIGHT THEN YOU WANT THAT RED LIGHT TO BE VERY VERY DIM CERTAINLY MUCH DIMMER THAN IS ON MOST OF THOSE COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS NOW DO YOU NEED RED LIGHTS NO ALTHOUGH RED LIGHTS ARE RATHER CONVENIENT BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE PRETTY WELL WITH THEM ON BUT IF THEI'RE DIM THEY WON'T WAKE UP THE CIRCADEAN CLOCK THEY WON'T HAVE THIS DOPOMEN DISRUPTING THING THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE PREVIOUS PODCAST SO THERE'S A ROLL FOR RED LIGHT POTENTIALLY EARLY IN THE DAY AND FOR MYTOCONDRUAL REPAIR IN THE PHOTORECEPTERS THERE'S A ROLL FOR DIM RED LIGHT LATER IN THE DAY AND AT NIGHT SERE STARTING TO NOTICE A THEME HERE WHICH IS THAT THERE'S NO IMMEDIATE PRESCRIPTION OF LOOK AT THESE LIGHTS IT'S LOOK AT THESE LIGHTS POTENTIALLY IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO DO AT PARTICULAR TIMES OF DAY N WAT PARTICULAR INTENSITIES AND BRINGS US BACK TO THE BLUE LIGHT ISSUE WHICH IS SO MANY PEOPLE ARE OBSESSED WITH AVOIDING BLUE LIGHT BE AS SHOU WANT ATON OF BLUE LIGHT EARLY IN THE DAY AND THROUGHOUT THE DAY SO DON'T WEAR YOUR BLUE BLOCKERS THEN OR MAYBE HAM DON'T WEAR THEM AT ALL AND AT NIGHT IT DOESN'T MATTER FFF BLUE BLOCKERS ON IF THE LIGHTS ARE BRIGHT ENOUGH THEN YOU'RE STILL CAN BE ACTIVATING THESE CELLS AND MECHANISMS I JUST WANT TA ADD SOMETHING UM SINCE ABOUT THE SCIENCE BEHIND THE BLUE BLOCKER OM CONFUSION SO THESE MELENOPS IN RETINAL CELLS DO REACT TO BLUE LIGHT THAT IS THE BEST STIMULUS FOR ONE OF THESE MELENOPS AND CELLS WHICH LED TO THE BELIEF THAT BLUE LOCKERS WOULD BE A GOOD THING FOR PREVENTING RESETTING OF THE CIRCADEAN CLOCK AT NIGHT AND DILITARIOUS EFFECTS OF SCREENS ET CETERA HOWEVER THE PEOPLE THAT MADE THESE PRODUCTS FAIL TO ACTUALLY READ THE PAPERS START TO FINISH OR IF THEY DID THEY DIDN'T COMPREHEND A CRITICAL ELEMENT WHICH IS THAT MOST OF THOSE PAPERS EARLY ON TOOK THOSE NURONS OUT AND PUT THEM IN A DISH AND WHEN THEY DID THAT THEY DIVORCED THOSE NURONS FROM THEIR NATURAL CONNECTIONS IN THE EYE TURNS OUT IN YOUR EYE AND EY EYE RIGHT NOW AS THAT'S WHAT WE CARE ABOUT THESE CELLS EXIST AND THESE CELLS RESPOND TO BLUE LIGHT BUT ALSO TO OTHER WAVE LENGTHS OF LIGHT BECAUSE THEY NOT ONLY RESPOND DIRECTLY TO LIGHT AS THEY DO IN A DISH THEY ALSO RESPOND TO IN PUT FROM PHOTORECEPTORS SO IF YOU TALK TO ANY ONE IN THE CIRCADIAN BIOLOGY FEELD THEY'LL TELL YOU OYA TIS BLULIGHT THING IS REALLY GOT AN AT A CONTROL BECAUSE PEOPLE ASSUME THAT BLUE LIGHT IS THE CULPERATE BECAUSE BLUE LIGHT IS THE BEST STIMULUS THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT BLUE LIGHT IS THE ONLY STIMULUS THAT WILL TRIGGER THESE CELLS OK SO LIKE MANY THINGS A SCIENTIFIC PAPER CAN BE ACCURATE WITHOUT BEING EXHAUSTIVE IN A LOT OF CLAIMS ABOUT PRODUCTS CAN BE ACCURATE BUT NOT EXHAUSTIVE SO BLUE LIGHT DURING THE DAY IS GREAT GET THAT SCREEN LIGHT GET THAT SUNLIGHT ESPECIALLY GET OVERHEAD LIGHTS I TALK ABOUT ALL IS IN THE PREVIOUS PODCASTS BUT AT NIGHT YOU REALLY WANT AVOID THOSE BRIGHT LIGHTS AND IT DOESN'T MATTER IF ITS BLUE LIGHT OR SOMETHING ELSE AND SODE THERE WAS A REAL CONFUSION ABOUT THE THE PAPERS AND AND THE DATA AM WHEN MOST OF THOSE PRODUCT RECOMMENDATIONS WERE MADE O K WHILE WE'RE ON THAT TOPIC LET'S TALK ABOUT LIGHT IN OTHER ORIFICES OF THE BODY I MADE A KIND OF A JOKE ABUT THIS THE LAST POD GAS EPISODE BUT A COUPLE BEAL WROAT TO ME AND SAID WELL I'VE SEEN SOME CLAIMS THAT LIGHT DELIVERED TO THE EARS INTO THE EARS OF THE ROOF OF THE MOUTH OR UP THE NOSE CAN BE BENEFICIAL FOR CIR CET SETTING CIRCATIAN RHYTTHMS A YE NO A NOT DIRECTLY ANYWAY AND THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN WHAT IS COMMONLY CALLED THE PLOCIBO EFFECT BUT A MORE IMPORTANT WAY TO THINK ABOUT ANY MANIPULATION BEHAVIOR OR OTHERWISE THAT YOU MIGHT DO IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MODULATION AND MEDIATION THERE ARE LOT OF THINGS THAT WILL MODULATE YOUR BIOLOGY PUTTING A COUPLE LIGHTS UP YOUR NOSE PLEASE DON'T DO THIS MIGHT MODULATE YOUR BIOLOGY BY WAY OF THE STRESS HORMONE THAT'S RELEASED WHEN YOU STUFF THOSE THINGS UP YOUR NOSE MEMBER EARLIER A PREVIOUS PODCAS I SAID THAT VIRTUALLY ANYTHING WILL FACE SHIFTS YOUR CIRCATIAN RHYTHM IF IT'S DIFFERENT AND DRAMATIC ENOUGH SO IT THE QUESTION IS IS IT THE LIGHT DELIVERED UP THE NOSE OR THROUGH THE EARS OR SOME OTHER ORIFICE THATS MEDIATING THE PROCESS IS IT ACTUALLY TAPPING INTO THE NATURAL BIOLOGY OF THE SYSTEM THAT YOUR TRYING TO MANIPULATE AND THIS IS WHERE I LIGHT TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN REAL BIOLOGY AND HACKS I DON'T LIKE THE WORD HACK OR FRANKLY NARROW HACKING OR BIO HACKING I JUST DON'T LIKE THE TERM BECAUSE A HACK IS IS USING SOMETHING FOR IT PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT WAS NOT INTENDED RIGHT BUT WHERE YOU CAN KIND OF IT'S A KIND OF A CHEAT AND THAT'S NOT HOW BIOLOGY WORKS WELL SO I TRY IND DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THINGS THAT REALLY MEDIATE BIOLOGICAL PROCESCES IN THINGS THAT MODULATE THEM THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OF COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS OUT THERE WITH SOME STUDIES ATTACHED TO THEM CLAIMING THAT LIGHT DELIVERED TO THE EARS OR WHEREVER CAN AM A JUST YOUR WAKEFULNESS ARE ADJUST YOUR SLEEP I'VE LOOKED AT THOSE PAPERS AGAIN A YON PRAGAN LOOSSOME FRIENDS BY SAYING THIS BUT MAY BE I'LL GAIN A FEW AS WELL A NOT BLUE RIBBON JOURNALS FRANKLY A OFTEN TIMES READ THE SMALL PRINT THERE WAS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST CLAWSE THERE RELATED TO COMMERCIAL INTERESE IF SOMEBODY DISAGREES WITH ME OUTRIGHT ON THIS AND CONSEND TO ME A PURE REVIEWED PAPER PUBLISH IN A QUALITY JOURNAL ABOUT LIGHT DELIVERED ANYWHERE BUT THE EYES OF HUMANS THAT CAN MEDIATE CIRCATEAN RHYTHMS WAKEFULNESS ET CETERA I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND CHANGE MY WORDS AND STANDS ON THIS AND DO IT PUBLICLY OF COURSE BUT UNTIL THEN UM YOU KNOW I'M GUESSING THAT THE PROPER CONTROLS WERE NOT DONE OF ADJUSTING FOR HEAT THAT COULD BE DELIVERED WHICH CAN DEFILIN SHIFT CIRCATIAN RHYTHMS WERE IN TALK ABOUT TEMPERATURE AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT SO LIGHT TO THE EYES FOLKS IS WHERE UM THESE LIGHT EFFECTS WORK IN HUMANS IN OTHER ANIMALS THEY HAVE EXTROCULAR PHOTORECEPTION INHUMANS KNOW UM AND JUST BE MINDFUL I MEAN I'M NOT TRAINING COURAGE PEOPLE TO AVOID CERTAIN PRODUCTS IN PARTICULAR BUT JUST BE MINDFUL OF THIS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MODULATION AND MEET AND MEDIATION AND MEDY A MEDIATING A PROCESS THROUGH A HARD WIRED OR LONG STANDING BY LOGICAL MECHANISM IS REALLY WHERE YOU UNASEE THE POWERFUL EFFACTS OVER TIME I ALSO AS YOU'VE PROBABLY NOTICED UM I REALLY TEND TO FAVOR BEHAVOURAL TOOLS AND ZEROL COST TOOLS FIRST IN GETTING THOSE DIALED IN BEFORE YOU START UM YOU KNOW PLUGGING AND PLUGGING IN AND SWALLOWING IN YOU KNOW PUTTING THINGS IN VARIOUS PLACES UM JUST TO REALLY FIGURE OUT HOW YOUR BY OLGOU WORKS AND EXPLORE THAT UNLESS THERE'S OF COURSE A CLENICAL MEAD TO TO TAKE A I PRESCRIBE DROGIN WHICH CASE BY ALL MEANS LISTEN TO YOUR DOCTOR OKE A HUGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ASKED ME ABOUT WHAT ABOUT LIGHT THROUGH WINDOWS AND I ASHUED IN INSGRAMPOST ABOUT THIS LOOK SETTING YOUR CIRCATIAN CLOCK WITH SUNLIGHT COMING THROUGH A WINDOW IS GOINGTO TAKE FIFTY TO A HUNDRED TIMES LONGER IF YOU WANT THE DATE ON THAT I'M I BE HAPPY TO SEND YOU TO THE VARIOUS PAPERS THAT WERE DESCRIBED IN THE PREVIOUS PODCAST THAT UM JAME SIZIR FROM STAMFORD AND I HAVE DESCUSSED ALSO ELSEWHERE BUT HERE'S REALLY THE KEY THING WITH THIS DO THE EXPERIMENT YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THE FREE AP LIGHT MEETER YOU CAN HAVE A BRIGHT DAY OUTSIDE OR SOME SUNLIGHT HOLD UP THAT AP TAKE A PICTURE IT'LL TELL YOU HOW MANY LUCKS NOW YOU KNOW IT LUCKS ARE IT WILL TLL YOU HOW MANY LUCKS ARE IN THAT ENVIRONMENT NOW CLOSE THE WINDOW AND IF YOU WANT CLOSE THE SCREEN OR DON'T OPEN THE STREEN YOU CAN DO ALL SORTS OF EXPERIMENTS YOU'LL SEE THAT IT WILL AT LEAST HALF THE AMOUNT OF LUCKS AND IT DOESN'T SCALE LINEARLY MEANING LET SAY I GET A TEN THOUSAND LUCKS OUTSIDE FIVE THOUSAND LOOKING OUT THROUGH AN OPEN WINDOW AND THEN I CLOSE THE WINDOW AND ITS TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED LUCKS IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU JUST NEED TO VIEW THAT SUNLIGHT FOR UM TWICE IS LONG IF IT'S HALF AS MANY LUCKS OKET IS NOT LIKE TWENTY FIVE A HUNDRED LUCKS MEANS YOU NEED TO LOOK FOR TEN MINUTES AND M FIVE THOUSAND LUCKS MEANS YOU LOOK FOR FIVE MINUTES IT DOESN'T SCALE THAT WAY JUST BECAUSE THE BIOLOGY DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY BEST THING TO DO IS TO GET OUTSIDE IF YOU CAN IF YOU CAN'T NEXT BEST THING TO DO IS TO KEEP THAT WINDOW OPEN IT IS PERFECTLY FINE TO WHEARE PRESCRIPTION LENSES AND CONTACTS WHY IS IT OCATETO WHERE PRESCRIPTION LENSES AND CONTACTS WHEN THOSE ARE GLASS ALSO BUT LOOKING THROUGH A WINDOW DIMINISHES THE EFFECT WELL WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT THIS THE LENSES THAT YOU WEAR IN FRONT OF YOUR EYES BY PRESCRIPTION OR ON YOUR E S ARE DESIGNED TO FOCUS THE LIGHT ON TO YOUR NURL RETNA IN FACT THAT'S WHAT NEAR SIGHTEDNESS AS IS AS WHEN THE IMAGE BECAUSE YOUR LENDS DOESN'T WORK QUITE RIGHT THE IMAGE FALLS IN FRONT OF THE NURL RETNA WEARING A PARTICULAR LENDS IN FRONT OF THAT FOCUS AS THE LENDS ON TO YOUR RETNA ON TO THESE VERY NUR ON SO THEY CAN COMMUNICATE THAT TO THE BRAIN IT'S COSTELLOS LOVING IN THIS LI HS DEEP IN SLEEP AND IF WE THAY WE COULD PLAM SOME TONES AND HE'LL REMEMBER IT LATER BASED ON THE STUDIES ORGAN A TALK ABOUT INAWIL BIT UM I DON'T KNOW HOW WE'D KNOW IF YOU REMEMBERED IT OR NOT BUT PRESCRIPTION LENDSES AR FINE IN FACT THERE GREAT FOR THIS REASON THEYRE ACTUALLY FOCUSSING THE LIGHT ON TO THE RETINA SO THINK ABOUT THIS LOGICALLY AND ALL THE SUN IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE YOUR GLASS WINDOW OR YOUR WIND SHIELD OR THE SIDE WINDOW OF YOUR CAR IT ISN'T A IT ISN'T OPTICULLY A PERFECT TO BRING THE IMAGE AND THE LIGHT ON TO YOUR RETNA IN FACT WHAT IT'S DOINGS ITS SCATTERING AND FILTERING LIGHT IN PARTICULAR THE WAY LINTS OF LIGHT THAT YOU WANT SO IF YOU LIVE IN A LOW LIGHT ENVIRONMENT A LOTS OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS WE TALKD ABOUT THIS THE PREVIOUS PODCAST BUT JUST GET OUTSIDE FOR LONGER OR AND OR USE REALLY BRIGHT LIGHTS INSIDE OCASO LET'S THINK ABOUT WY I'M MAKING SOME OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS BECAUSE I THINK IT CAN REALLY IMPOWER YOU WITH THE ABILITY TO CHANGE YOUR BEHAVIOR IN TERMS OF LIGHT VIEWING AND OTHER THINGS DEPENDING ON TIME OF YEAR DEPENDING ON OTHER LIFE STYLE FACTORS IMPORTANT POINT UNDERSTAND IS THAT EARLY IN THE DAY YOUR CENTRAL CIRCADEAN CLOCKS AND ALL THESE MECHANISMS ARE LOOKING FOR A LOT OF LIGHT I MEN THEY DON'T HAVE A MIND TO THEIR OWN BUT IT NEEDS A LOT OF LIGHT TO TRIGGER THIS DAYTIME SIGNAL ALERTNESS ET CETERA AND EARLY IN THE DAY BUT NOT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY YOU CAN SUM OR ADD FOTONS SO THERE'S THIS BRIEF PERIOD OF TIME EARLY IN THE DAY WHEN THE SUN IS LOW IN THE SKY WHEN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY ARE EXPECTING A MORNING WAKE UP SIGNAL WHERE LET'S SAY IT'S NOT THAT BRIGHT OUTSIDE SOME ONE SENT ME A PICTURE OR LO MOVY OF THEIR WALK IN ENGLAND AND IT WAS PRETTY OVERCAST AND THEY WERE USING LIGHT METER AND THEY SAID IT'S ONLY ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED LUCKS OR MAYBE EVEN LESS AND I SAID WELL STAY OUTSIDE LONGER BUT WHEN YOU GET INSIDE TURN ON THE LIGHTS REALLY BRIGHT AND OVERHEAD LIGHTS IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE THOSE WL BE BEST FOR STIMULATING THESE MECHANISMS AND THAT'S BECAUSE AT LEAST FOR THE FIRST FEW HOURS OF THE DAY YOU CONCONTINUE TO SUM OR ADD POTON ACTIVATION OF THESE CELLS IN THE EYE AND THE BRAIN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY ONCE THE SUN IS OVERHEAD OR EVEN IF YOU STAY INSIDE ALL ALL MORNING AND THEN YOU'RE IN THE CIRCADIAN DEDZONE WHICH SOUNDS TERRIBLE AND IT IS TERRIBLE BECAUSE YOU DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU GET A TON OF ARTIFICIAL LIGHT OR EVEN SUNLIGHT YOU'RE NOT CAN A SHIFT YOUR CIRCADIAN CLOCK YOU'RE NOT ONG GET THAT WAKE UP SIGNAL AND THEN IN THE EVENING YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT THIS WHOLE SYSTEM AS BEING VULNERABLE TO EVEN A FEW FOTONS OF L IGHT BECAUSE YOU ARE SENSITIVITY TO LIGHT REALLY GOES UP AT NIGHT AND I TALK THE LAST TIME ABOUT HOW YOU CAN PROTECT AGAINST THAT SENSITIVITY BY LOOKING AT THE SETTING SUN AND WATCHING THE EVENING SUN EVEN OF ITS NOT CROSSING THE HORAZIN AROUND THE TIME OF SUNSET AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT ADJUST YOUR RETINAL SENSITIVITY AND YOUR MELOTONAN PATHWAYS SO THAT LIGHT IS NOT AS DETRIMENTAL TO MELOTONE AND AT NIGHT THINK ABOUT THE AFTERNOON SUNLIGHT VIEWING AS KIND OF A A I THINK OF IT IS KIND OF A NET FLICS INOCULATION IT ALLOWS ME TO WATCH A LITTLE  OF NET FLICTS IN THE EVENING ON L THET'S VERY HARD TO WATCH A LITTLE BIT OF ANYTHING ON THAT FLICKS IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S SOME OTHER NOR BIOLOGICAL PROCES TO GOING ON THERE WHERE I HAVE TO WATCH EPISODE AFTER EPISODE AFTER EPISODE BUT IN ANY CASE YOU CAN PROTECT YOURSELF AGAINST SOME OF THAT BAD EFFECT OF LIGHT AT NIGHT BY LOOKING AT LIGHT IN THE EVENING IT REALLY DOES ATJUST DOWN THE SENSITIVITY OF THE SYSTEM OK I WON'T TALK ABOUT SEASONAL CHANGES IN ALL THESE THINGS AS THEY RELATE TO MOOD AND METABOLISM SO DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE IN THE WORLD NORTHERN HEMISPHERE SOUTHERN HEMISHERE AT THE EQUATOR OR CLOSER TO THE POLES THE DAYS AND NIGHTS ARE GING T BE DIFFERENT LENGTHS THAT JUST MAKE SENSE BUT THAT TRANSLATES TO REAL BIOLOGICAL SIGNALS THAT IMPACT EVERYTHING FROM WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP TIMES BUT ALSO MOOD AND METABOLISM SO HERE'S HOW THIS WORKS NOW AFTER SEEING THE PREVIOUS EPISODE OF THE PODCAST AND PAYING ATTENTION HERE YOU ARE ARMED WITH THE KNOWLEDGE TO REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW IT IS THAT BELIEVE IT ORE NOT EVERY SELL IN YOUR BODY IS TUNED TO THE MOVEMENT OF THE PLANET RELATIVE TO THE SUN SO AS ALL IF YOU KNOW THE EARTH SPINS ONCE EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS ON ITS AXIS SO PART OF THAT DAY WERE BATHED IN SUNLIGHT DEPENDING ON WHERE WE ARE THE OTHER HALF OF THE DAY OR PART OF THE DAY WERE IN DARKNES THE EARTH ALSO TRAVELS AROUND THE SUN THREE HUNDRED SIXTY IVE DAYS IS THE TIME THAT IT TAKES ON YEAR TO TRAVEL AROUND THAT SUN THE EARTH IS TILTED IT'S NOT PERFECTLY UPRIGHT SO THE EARTH IS TILTED ON ITS AXIS SO DEPENDING ON WHERE WE ARE IN THAT THREE HUNDRE AND SIXTY FIVE DAY JOURNEY AND DEPENDING ON WHERE WE ARE IN TERMS OF HEMISPHERE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE SOME DAYS OF THE YEAR ARE LONGER THAN OTHERS SOME ARE VERY SHORT SOMEMARE VERY LONG IF YOT THE AT THE QUATER YOU EXPERIENCE LESS VARIATION IN DAYLENGTHEN THERE FORE NIGHT LENGTH AND IF YOU'RE CLOSER TO THE POLES YOU'RE GING O EXPERIENCE SOME VERY LONG DAYS AND YOUR ALSO GAN EXPERIENCE SOME VERY SHORT DAYS DEPENDING ON WHICH POLE YOUR AT AND WHAT TIME A YEAR IT IS THE SIMPLE WAY TO PUT THIS AS DEPENDING ON TIME OF YEAR THE DAYS ARE EITHE GETTING SHORTER OR GETTING LONGER NOW EVERY SELLING YOUR BODY ADJUST ITS BIOLOGY ACCORDING TO DAYLENGTH EXCEPT YOURE BRAIN BODY AND SELLS DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT DAYLENGTH IT ONLY KNOWS NIGHT LENGTH AND HERE'S HOU IT WORKS LIGHT INHIBITS MELOTONAN POWERFULLY IF DAYS ARE LONG AND GETTING LONGER THAT MEANS MELATONAN IS REDUCED THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF MELATONAN IS LESS BECAUSE LIGHT IS MORE THEIREFORE MELATONAN IS LESS IF DAYS ARE GETTING SHORTER LIGHT CAN'T INHIBIT MELATONAN AS MUCH THROUGH THE SUMMING OF PHOTON MECHANISMS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE AND THAT MELATONAN SIGNAL IS GETTING LONGER SO EVERY CELL IN YOUR BODY ACTUALLY KNOWS EXTERNAL DAY LENGTH AND THEREFORE TIME OF YEAR BY WAY OF THE DURATION OF THE MELATONAN SIGNAL END IN GENERAL IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT IN DIURNAL ANIMALS MEANING ANIMALS LIKE US THAT TEND TO BE AWAKE DURING THE DAYTIME AND NOT NOCTURNAL ANIMALS WHICH TEND TOBE AWAKE AT NIGHT THE LONGER THE MELATONAN SIGNAL THE MORE DEPRESSED NOT INASILLY CLINICALLY DEPRESSED ALTHOUGH THAT CANT HAPPEN BUT THE MORE DEPRESSED ARE SYSTEMS TEND TO BE REPRODUCTION METABOLISM MOOD TURN OVER RATES OF SKINCELLS AND HAIR CELLS ALL TEND TO BE DIMINISHED COMPARED TO THE SPRING AND SUMMER MONTHS FOR SOME NORTHERN HEMOSPHERE SPRING N SEVER MONTHS OR THET TIMES IN WHICH DAYS ARE VERY LONG AND THERE'S LESS MELATONIAN THAT TENDS TO IN ALMOST ALL ANIMALS INCLUDING HUMANS MORE BREEDING MORE HORMONE ELEVATION OF THE HORMONTS THAT STIMULATE BREEDING REPRODUCTION AND AND A AND FERTILITY METABOLISM IS UP LIPID METABOLISM FAT BURNING IS UP PROACHING SYNTHESIS IS UP THESE THINGS TEND TO CORELATE WITH THE SEASONS NOW SOME PEOPLE ARE VERY VERY STRONGLY TIE TO THE SEASONS THEY GET DEPRESSED CLINICALLY DEPRESSED IN WINTER AND LIGHT THERAPIES ARE VERY USEFUL FOR THOSE PEOPLE SOME PEOPLE LOVE THE WINTER AND TEIR HAPPIEST IN WINTER AND THEY FEEL KIND OF DEPRESSED IN SUMMER ALTHOUGH THAT IS FAR MORE RARE THAT DOESN'T MEAN DEPRESSION CANNOT EXIST IN THE SUMMER BUT WHEN WERETIE MOT SEASONAL DEPRESSION THAT TENDS TO BE TRUE ITS MORE DEPRESSION IN WINTER NOW THERE IS OTHER THINGS THAT CORRELATE WITH SEASONALITY SUICIDE RATES TEND TO BE HIGHEST IN THE SPRING NOT IN THE WINTER BUT THAT AS TO DO WITH SOME OF THE A MORE COMPLICATED AND UNFORTUNALY TRAGIC ASPECTS OF SUICIDE WHICH IS THAT OFTENTIMES PEOPLE WILL COMMIT SUICIDE NOT AT THE AT THE VERY DEPTHS OF THEIR ENERGY LEVELS BUT AS THEIR EMERGING FROM THOSE DEPTHS OF LOW ENERGY SO WE'LL TALK ABOUT SUICIDALIDY AND AND MOOD DISORDERS IN A LATER PODCAST SEASON MEANING A MONTH LATER BUT UM FOR NOW JUST T UNDERSTAND THAT EVERYBODY IS GOING THROUGH THESE NATURAL FLUCTUATIONS DEPENDING ON THE DURATION OF THE MELATONAN SIGNAL NOW THIS MIGHT LEAD YOU TO SAY WELL THAN I SHOULD JUST REALLY GET AS MUCH LIGHT AS I CAN ALL THE TIME AND REDUCE MELATONIAN FEEL GREAT ALL THE TIME UNFORTUNE T DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY BECAUSE MELATONAN ALSO HAS IMPORTANT EFFECTS ON THE IMUNE SYSTEM IT HAS IMPORTAN EFFECTS ON TRANSMITTER SYSTEMS IN THE BRAIN ET CETERA SO EVERYBODY NEEDS TO FIGURE OUT FOR THEMSELVES HOW MUCH LIGHT THEY NEED EARLY IN THE DAY AND HOW MUCH LIKE THEY NEED TO AVOID LATE IN THE DAY IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE THEIR MOOD AN METABOLISM T THERE IS NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL PRESCRIPTION BECAUSE THERE IS A RANGE OF MELOTONAND RECEPTERS THERE A RANGE OF O OF EVERYTHING FROM METABOLIC TYPES TO GENETIC HISTORIES FAMILY HISTORIES ET CETERA THERE IS NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL PRESCRIPTION BUT BY UNDERSTANDING THAT LIGHT AND EXTENDED DAYLENGTH AND HIBIT MELOTONAN AND MELATONA ATENDS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH A MORE DEPRESSED OR REDUCED FUNCTIONING OF THESE KIND OF ACTIVITY DRIVING AND A MOOD ELEVATING SIGNALS AN UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU HAVE SOME CONTROL OVER MELOTONAN BY WAY OF LIGHT INCLUDING SUNLIGHT BUT ALSO ARTIFICIAL LIGHT THAT SHOULD EMPOWER YOU I BELIEVE TO MAKE THE ADJUSTMENTS THAT IF YOUR FEELING LOW YOU MIGHT ASK HOW MUCH LIGHT OF I GETTING WHEN AM I GETTING THAT LIGHT BECAUSE SLEEP IS ALSO IMPORTANT FOR RESTORING MOOD RIGHT SO YOU NEED SLEEP YOU CAN'T JUST YOU KNOW JUST CRUSH MELOTONAN ACROSS THE BOARD AND EXPECT TO FEEL GOOD BECAUS THEN YOUR NOT CAN FALL SLEEP AND STAY ASLEEP MELATONAN NOT INCIDENTALLY COMES FROM IS SYNTHESIZED FROM CERATONA CERATONAN IS AN AROTRANSMITTER THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH FEELINGS OF WELL BEING PROVIDEDS AT PROPER LEVELS BUT WELL BEING OF A PARTICULAR KIND WELL BEING ASSOCIATED WITH QOIESCENCE AND CALM AND THE FEELING THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES IN OUR IMMEDIATE CON CONDITIONS IS THE KIND OF THING THAT COMES FROM A GOOD MEAL OR SITTING DOWN WITH FRIENDS OR HOLDING A LOVED ONE OR O CONVERSING WITH SOMEBODY THAT YOU REALLY BOND WITH SERATONAN DOES NOT STIMULATE ACTION IT TENDS TO STIMULATE STILLNESS VERY DIFFERENT THEN THE NORMODULATOR DOPAMINE WHICH IS A REWARD FEEL GOOD NERAMODULATOR THAT STIMULATES ACTION AND ACTUALLY DOPOMINE IS THE PRECURSOR TO EPINEPERANT TO A DRENALINE WHICH ACTUALLY PUTS US INTO ACTION THERE ITSECTALY MADE FROM DOPOMY RIGHT SO YOU CAN STARCH TA THNG ABOUT LIGHT AS A SIGNAL THAT IS VERY POWERFUL FOR MODULATING THINGS LIKE SLEEP AN WAKEFULNESS BUT ALSO SERATONAN LEVELS MELATONAN LEVELS AND I TALK ABOUT THIS PREVIOUSLY BUT ILL MENTION ONCE MORE THAT LIGHT IN THE MIDDLE THE NIGHT REDUCES DOPOMINE LEVELS TO THE POINT WHERE IT CAN START CAUSING PROBLEMS WITH LEARNING A MEMORY AND MOOD THAT'S ONE POWERFUL REASON TO AVOID BRIGHT LIGHT N THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT O SEASONAL RHYTHMS HAVE A NUMBER OF EFFECTS BUT HUMANS ARE NOT SEE PURELY SEASONABLE BREEDERS UNLIKE A LOT OF ANIMALS WE BREED ALL YOUR LONG IN FACT O O THERE'S A AA PREPONDERANCE OF SEPTEMBER BABIES IN MY LIFE A NOT ACTUAL BABIES WEOBLE THER BORNE IN SEPTEMBER WHICH MEANS THAT THEY WERE CONCEIVED IN DECEMBER I WITHOUT KNOWING THE DETAILS WE WE CAN AIRLY ASSUME THAT A AND DECEMBER AT LEAST IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE THAT DAYS TEND TO BE SHORTER AND A YOU DON'T NIGHTS TEN TO BE LONGER SO CLEARLY HUMANS AREN'T SEASONAL BREEDERS BUT THERE ARE SHIFTS IN IN BREEDING AND FERTILITY THAT EXISTING HUMANS BUT ALSO MUCH MORE STRONGLY IN OTHER ANIMALS SO SEASONABLE EFFECTS VARY SOME OF YOU WILL EX PERIENCE VERY STRONG SESONON FECTS OTHERS OF YOU WILL NOT I THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD BE TAKING CARE TO GET ADEQUATE SUNLIGHT AND TO AVOID BRIGHT LIGHT AT NIGHT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR IF POSSIBLE THROUGHOUT THIS PODCAST AND IN PREVIOUS EPISODES I'VE BEEN MENTIONING NEROMODULATORS THINGS LIKE CERATONAN AND DOPOMIN WHICH TEND TO BUY A CERTAIN BRAIN CIRCUITS AND THINGS IN OUR BODY TO HAPPEN AND CERTAIN BRAIN CIRCUITS AND THINGS OUR BODY NOT TO HAPPEN ONE OF THE ONES I'VE MENTION NUMEROUS TIMESS EPINEPHRAN WHICH IS A NEROMODULATOR THAT TENDS TO PUT US IN TO ACTION MAKE US WANT TO MOVE IN FACT WHEN IT'S RELEASED IN HIGH AMOUNTS IN OUR BRAIN AND BODY IT CAN LEAD TO WHAT WE CALL STRESS OR THE FEELING OF BEING STRESSED SEVERAL PEOPLE ASKED ME WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EPINEPHRAN AND A DRENOLIN A DRENALINE IS SECRETED FROM THE ADRENAL GLANDS WHICH SIT RIGHT ABOVE OUR KIDNEYS EPINEPRAN IS THE EXACT SAME MOLECULE EXCEPT THAT ITS RELEASED WITHIN THE BRAIN AND SO PEOPLE USE THESE PHRASES ARE THESE WORDS RATHER INTERCHANGEABLY EPY MEANS NEAR WERE ON TOP OF SOMETIMES AND NEP NEP ANY TIME YOU SEE NEPHRON OR EF IT MEANS KIDNEY SO IT MEANS NEAR THE KIDNEY SO EPINEPRN ECXTUALLY MEANS NEAR THE KIDNEY SO IT WAS USED ORIGINALLY TO DESCRIBE DRENOLIN BUT EPINEPRAN AND DRENALIN AR BASICALLY THE SAME THING AND THEY TTO STIMULATE AGITATION AND THE DESIRE TO MOVE THAT'S WHAT THAT'S ABOUT WHICH BRINGS US TO THE TOPIC OF EXERCISE GOT LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT EXERISE WHAT FORMS OF EXERCISE ARE BEST FOR SLEEPING WELL WHEN SHOULD I EXERCISE ET CETERA THERE'S A LOT OF INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY AROUND THIS BUT I CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT I KNOW FROM THE SCIENCE LITERATURE AND WHAT I HAPPEN TO DO MYSELF THERE ARE BASICLY TWO FORMS OF EXERCISE THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT ALTHOUGH OF COURSE I REALIZE THEIR MANY DIFFERENT FORMS OF EXERCISEERS MUCH WORE NUAUNTS TO THIS BUT WE INDIGE ABOUT CARTY OF ASCULAR EXERCISE WHERE THE IDEAS TO REPEAT A MOVEMENT OVER AND OVER AND OVER CONTINUOUSLY SIVY LIKE RUNNING BIKING ROWING INTHE CYCLING THIS KIND OF THING OR THERE'S A RESISTANCE EXERCISE WHERE YOUR MOVING LIFTING PRESUME WY PUTTING DOWN ALSO A THINGS OF PROGRESSIVELY HAVE YOUR IHAVE YOUR WEIGHT A THAT YOU COULDN'T DO CONTINUOUSLY FOR FOR THIRTY MINUTES A SO CARDY OF ASCULAR EXERCISE IS TYPICALLY THE MORE ROBIC TYPE EXERCISE AND RESISTANCE EXERCISE OF COURSE IS THE MORE INEROBIC TYPE EXERCISE AND YES THEIRES VARIATION BETWEEN THE TWO MOST STUDIES OF EXERCISE HAVE LOOKED AT A ROBIC EXERCISE BECAUSE THAT'S BASICALLY THE THING THAT YOU CAN GET A RAT OR AMOUTS TO DO NWHT'S REALLY WEIRD ABOUT RATS AND MICE THEY L LIKE TO RUN ON WHEELS SO MUCH THAT SOME ONE ISHLY DID THE STUDY WAS PUBLISHED IN SCIENCE THEY PUT A WHEEL A RUNNING WHEEL IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIELD AND MICE RAN TO THAT WHEEL AND RAN ON THE WHEEL THEY TURNS OUT THAT WHAT THEY LIKE IS THE PASSAGE OF THE VISUAL IMAGE OF THE BARS IN FRONT OF THEIR FACE WHICH I FIND A KIND OF A REMARKABLE AND TROUBLING CAUSE IT SEEMS SO LIKE TRIVIAL BUT ANYWAY THEY LOVE A ROBIC EXERCISE AND SO MOST THE STUDIES WERE DONE ON THESE MICE THAT LOVE RUNNING ON WHEELS RES SO FAR AS A IT'S BEEN CHALLENGING TO FIND CONDITIONS IN WHICH MICE REALLY LIKE TO LIFT WAIGHTS OR WILL DO IT IN A LABORATORY SO ANY WAIT BEARING EXERCISE STUDIES REALLY HAVE TO BE DONE IN HUMANS AND SINCE HUMANS ARE WHAT WE'RE INTERESTED ING A THERE ARE SOME STUDIES LOOKING AT THESE TWO THINGS AND WHEN THEY TEND TO WORK BEST NOW YOU WILL SEE SOME PLACES OF ROBIC EXERCISE BEST DONE IN THE MORNING AND WAIGHT TRAINING IS BEST DONE IN THE AFTERNOON I THINK THERE'S FAR MORE INDIVIDUAL VARIATION THAN THAT M I THINK THERE ARE HOWEVER A COUPLE WINDOWS THAT THE EXERCISE SCIENCED LITERATURE AND THE CIRCADIAN LIERTURE POINTS TO AS WINDOWS RELATED TO BODY TEMPERATURE IN WHICH PERFORMANCE INJURY A IN WHICH PERFORMANCEIS OPTIMIZE INJURY IS REDUCED AND SO ON AND THOSE TEND TO BE THIRTY MINUTES AFTER WAKING AND THAT PROBABLY CORRELATES WITH THE INFLECTION IN QUARTUS ALL ASSOCIATED WITH WAKING WHETHER NOT YOU'VE GET IN LIGHT OR NOT THREE HOURS AFTER WAKING WHICH PROBABLY CORRELATES TO THE RISE AN BODY TEMPERATURE SOMETIME RUN AROUND WAKING AND THE LATER AFTERNOON USUALLY ELEVEN HOURS AFTER WAKING WHICH IS WHEN TEMPERATURE TENDS TO PEAKE SO SOME PEOPLE LIKE EXERCISE IN THE MORNING SOME PEOPLE LIKE EXERCISE IN THE AFTERNOON IT REALLY DEPENDS I THINK FOR THOSE OF US WITH VERY BUSY SCHEDULS IT'S A ADVANTAGEOUS TO BE ABLE TO TO DO YOUR TRAINING WHENEVER YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT A UNLESS YOU CAN REALLY CONTROL YOUR SCHADUL AND SO I WOULD NEVER WANT THESE A RECOMMENDATIONS TO SEEM LIKE RECOMMENDATIONS WHAT I'M REALLY DESCRIBING SOME OPPORTUNITIES THIRTY MINUTES AFTER WAKING THREE HOURS AFTER WAKING OR ELEVEN HOURS AFTER WAKING HAS BEEN SHOWN AT LEAST IN SOME STUDIES TO OPTIMIZE PERFORMANCE REDUCE INJURY IN THAT SORT OF THING BE REALLY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WORKS FOR YOU A NOTE ABOUT WORKING OUT FIRT THING IN THE MORNING LAST TIME WE TALKED ABOUT NONPHOTIC FACESHIFTS IF YOU EXERCISE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING YOUR BODY WILL START TO DEVELOP AN ANTICIPATORY CIRCUIT THERE'S ACHALLY PLASTICITY IN THESE CIRCADIAN CIRCUITS THAT WILL LEAD YOU TO WANT TO WAKE UP AT THE PARTICULAR TIME THAT YOU EXERCISE THE PREVIOUS THREE OR FOUR DAYS SO THAT CAN BE A POWERFUL TOOL BUT YOU STILL WANT TO GET LIGHT EXPOSURE BECUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT LIGHT AND EXERCISE CONVERGE TO GIVING EVEN BIGGER WAKE UP SIGNAL TO THE BRAIN AND BODY SOM I WANT O THINK ABOUT THAT SOME PEOPLE FIND IF THE EXERCISE LATE IN THE DAY THEY HAVE TROUBLE SLEEPING IN GENERAL IN TENE EXERCI S DOES THAT WHEREAS THE KIND OF LOWER INTENSITY EXERCISE DOESN'T I FOUND SOME INTERESTING LITERATURE THAT TALKED ABOUT SLEEP NEED AND EXERCISE I FOUND THIS FASCINATING THAT A IF ONE IS WAKING NOT FEELING RESTED AND RECOVERED FROM AND YET SLEEPING THE SAME AMOUNT THAT THEY TYPICALLY HAVE IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE THAT THE INTENSITY OF EXERCISE IN THE PROCEEDING TWO OR THREE DAYS IS TOO HIGH WHEREAS IF ONE CANT A RECOVER NO MATTER HOW MUCH SLEEP THEY GET THEIRE JUST SLEEPY ALL THE TIME IW REALIZE THESE THINGS ARE CORRELATED THAT THE VOLUME OF TRAINING MIGHT BE TOO HIGH NOW I'M NOT AN EXERCISE SCIENTISTS WE SHOULD PRATHLER GET ON ANY GALPIN OR SOMEBODY ELSE ON HERE WHOSE A REALLY AN EXPERT IN THIS KIND OF STUFF I I DO REALIZE AS SOON AS ANY ONE TALKS ABY EXERCISE OR NUTRITION PUBLICLY THERE BASICALLY OPENING THEMSELVES UP TO ALL SORTS OF A CHALLENGES BECAUSE YOU CAN BASELY FIND SUPPORT FOR ALMOST ANY PRO TO CALL IN THE LITERATURE WHAT I'VE LOOKED AT WAS A TWO JOURNALS IN PARTICULAR A INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL CHRONOBIOLOGY AM AND A EN JOURNAL BIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS EXCUSE ME TO A TO ASSESS THESE PERAMETERS THAT I  MENTION JUST JUST A MOMENT AGO BECAUSE THE STUDIES TENDED TO BE DONE INHUMANS THEY WERE FAIRLY RECENT AND THEY CAME FROM AM GROUPS THAT I RECOGNIZED AS WELL AS A KNOWING THAT THOSE JOURNALS ARE PURE REVIEWED MANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS WERE ABOUT NURL PLASTICITY WHICH IS THE BRAING AND NERVOUS SYSTEMS ABILITY TO CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO EXPERIENCE THERE WAS A QUESTION THAT ASKED WHETHER OR NOT THESE REALLY DEEP BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS AROUND WAKEFULNESS TIME OF WAKING SLEEP ET CETERA WERE SUBJECT TO NERAL PLASTICITY AND INDEED THEY ARE SOME OF THAT PLASTICITY IS SHORT TERMIN SOME OF IT IS MORE LONG TERM THERE'S A REALLY GOOD ANALOGY HERE WHICH IS IF YOU HAPPEN TO EAT ON A VERY TIGHT SCHEDULE WHERE EVERY DAY SAY AT ET A M NOON AND SEVEN P M IS WHEN YOU EAT YOUR FOOD NOT SUGGESTING YOU DO THIS BUT THET SAY YOU WERE TO DO THAT FOR A COUPLE DAYS AFTER A FEW DAYS YOU WOULD START TO ANTICIPATE THOSE MEAL TIMES WHERE NO MATTER WHERE YOU WERE IN THE WORLD NO MATTER WHAT WAS GOING ON IN YOUR LIFE ABOUT FIVE TO TEN MINUTES BEFORE THOSE MEAL TIMES YOU WOULD START TO FEEL HUNGRY AND EVEN AGITATED WHICH IS YOUR BODIES WAY OF TRYING TO GET YOU TO FORGE FOR FOOD AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF SOME PEPTIED SIGNALS THAT COME FROM THE PERIFERY FROM YOUR BODY THINGS LIKE HYPOCRET AN ERECTS AN THAT SIGNAL TO THE HYPOTHALEMIS AND BRAIN STEM TO MAKE YOU ACTIVE AND ALERT AND LOOKFOR FOOD AND FEEL HUNGRY SO THERE'S CONE OF AN ANTICIPATORY CIRCUIT THAT'S A CHEMICAL CIRCUIT BUT EVENTUALLY OVER TIME THE NURONS THE NURL CIRCUITS THAT CONTROL HYPOCRETEIN ERECTS AND WOULD GET TUNED TO THE NERL CIRCUITS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN ET ANG AND MAY EVEN SMELL AND TASTE TO CREATE A KIND OF EATING CIRCUIT THAT'S UNIQUE TO YOUR PATTERN TO YOUR RHYTHMS THE SAME THING IS TRUE FOR THESE WAKING AND EXERCISE AND OTHER SCHEDULES INCLUDING ALL TRADIAN SCHEDULS IF YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND START GETTING YOUR SUNLIGHT YOU START EXERCISING IN THE MORNING YOU EXERCISE IN THE AFTERNOON PRETTY SOON YOUR BODY WILL TART TO ANTICIPATE THAT AND START O SECRETE HORMONES AND OTHER SIGNALS THAT PREPARE YOUR BODY FOR THE ENSUING ACTIVITY OF WAKING UP ORE GOING TO SLEEP SO IF YOU GET ON TO A PATTERN OR RHYTHM EVEN IF THAT RHYTHM ISN'T DOWN TO THE MINUTE YOU'LL FIND THAT THERE'S PLASTICITY IN THESE SARCUTS AND IT BECOMES EASIER TO WAKE UP EARLY IF THAT'S YOUR THING OR EXERCISE AT A PARTICULAR DAY IF THAT'S YOUR THING THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF NORAL PLASTICITY A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ASKED WHAT CAN I DO TO INCREASE PLASTICITY AND THAT REALLY COMES IN TO FORMS THERE'S PLASTICITY THAT WE CAN ACCESS IN SLEEP TO IMPROVE RATES OF LEARNING AN DEPTH OF LEARNING FROM THE PREVIOUS DAY OR SO AND THERE'S THIS AN ST AR NON SLEEP DEEP BREAST THAT CAN BE DONE WITHOUT SLEEPING TO IMPROVE RATES OF LEARNING AND DEPTH OF RETENSION ET CETERA SO LET'S CONSIDER THE THOSE BOTH AND YOU CAN INCORPORATE THESE PROTOCALLS IF YOU LIKE AGAIN THESE ARE BASED ON QUALITY PERE REVIEWED STUDIES FIRST LET'S TALK ABOUT LEARNING IN SLEEP THIS IS BASED ON SOME WORK THAT I BUT PROVIDE THE REFERENCE FOR THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL SCIENCE EXCELLENT JOURNAL MATWALK ARE ALSO TALKS ABOUT SOME OF THESE STUDIES M DONE BY OTHERS IN HIS BOOK WHI WE SLEEP THE STUDIES JUST TO REMIND YOU ARE STRUCTURED THE FOLLOWING WAY AN INDIVIDUAL IS BROUGHT INTO A LABORATORY LOOK DOES A SPACIAL MEMORY TASTS O THEIR TENDS TO BE A A SCREEN WITH A BUNCH A DIFFERENT OBJECTS POPPING UP ON THE SCREEN IN DIFFERENT LOCATION SO MIGHT BE A BULLDOG'S FACE THAT MIGHT BE A CAT THAN IT MIGHT BE AN APPLE THAN IT MIGHT BE A PEN INDIFFERENT LOCATIONS AND THAT SOUNDS TRIVIALLY EASY BUT WITH TIME YOU CAN IMAGINE IT GETS PRETTY TOUGH TO COME BACK A DAY LATER REMEMBER IF SOMETHING PRESENTED IN A GIVEN LOCATION WAS SOMETHING YOU'VE SEEM BEFORE AND WHETHER NOT IT WAS PRESENTED N THAT LOCATION ORE DIFFERENT LOCATION YOU HAD ENOUGH OBJECTS AND CHANGE LOCATIONS ENOUGH THIS CAN ACTUL BE QUITE DIFFICULT IN THIS STUDY P THE SUBJECTS EITHER JUST WENT THROUGH THA THE EXPERIMENT OR A PARTICULAR ODOR WAS A RELEASED INTO THE ROOM WHILE THEY WERE LEARNING OR A TONE WAS PLAYED IN THE ROOM WHILE THEY WERE LEARNING AND THEN JURING THE SLEEP OF THOSE SUBJECTS THE FOLLOWING NIGHT AND THE FOLLOWING NIGHT HSO WAS DONE REPEATEDLEP FOR SEVERAL NIGHTS THE SAME ODOR OR TONE WAS PLAYED WHILE THE SUBJECTS WERE SLEEPING THEY DID THIS IN DIFFERENT STAGES OF SLEEP NONREM SLEEP AND RAPID I MOVE IN SLEEP REM SLEEP THEY DID THIS WITH JUST THE TONE IN SLEEP A IF THEY IF THE SUBJECTS HAD HAD THE ODOR BUT NOT THE TONE THEY HAD THEY DID IT WITH PUTTING THE TONE IF THEY HAD AD THE ODOR WHILE LEARNING SO BASILY ALL THE CONTROLS ALL THE THINGS YOU WANT TO SEE DONE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS IN SOME INDIRECT A FACTS A MODULATORY EFFACT AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT PROVIDING THE SAME STIMULUS THE ODOR IF THEY SMELLED AN ODOR OR A TONE IF THE SUBJECTS HEARD A TONE WHILE LEARNING IF THEY JUST DELIVERED THAT ODOR OR TONE WHILE THE SUBJECT SLEPT RATES OF LEARNING AND RETENSION OF INFORMATION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER  PRETTY COOL WHAT THIS MEANS THAT YOU CAN CUE THE SUBCONSCIOUS BRAIN THE ASLEEP BRAIN TO LEARN PARTICULAR THINGS BETTER AND FASTER SO HOW MIGHT YOU IMPLEMENT THIS WELL YOU COULD PLAY WITH THIS IF YOU WANT I DON'T SEE ANY REAL CHALLENGE TO THIS PROVIDED THE ODOR AND A IS A SAFE ONE AND DOESN'T WAKE YOU UP IN THE TONE IS A SAFE A SAFE ONE AND DOESN'T WAKE YOU UP AM YOU COULD DO THIS BY HAVING A METRONEM FOR INSTANCE WHILE UM LEARNING SOMETHING PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND OR PARTICULAR MUSIC AND THEN HAVE THAT VERY FAINTLY WHILE YOU SLEEP SO YOU COULD APPLY THIS IF YOU LIKE AND AND TRY THIS A THERE ARE NUMBER OF GROUPS A I THINK NOW THAT ARE TRYING THIS USING TACTILE STIMULATION SO SLIGHT VIBRATION ON THE WRIST DURING LEARNING AND THEN THE SAME VIBRATION ON THE WRIST DURING SLEEP IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT THE SENSORY MODALITY WHETHER NOTS ODOR OR A AUDITORY TONE OR TACTILE STIMULATIONS SOME AU SENSERY STIMULATION IT WHETHER NOT IT MATTERS IT'S REMARKABLE BECAUSE IT REALLY SHOWS THAT SLEEP IS AN EXTENSION OF THE WAKING STATE WE'VE KNOWN THAT FOR A LONG TIME BUT THIS REALLY TETHERS THOSE TWO IN A VERY MEANINGFUL AN ACTIONABLE WAY SO I THINK ALL REPORT A BACKU AS I LEARN MORE ABOUT THESE STUDIES BUT THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I KNOW ABOUT THEM AT THIS POINT AS LONG AS WERE THERE WE MIGH AS WELL TALK ABOUT DREAMING CAUSE I GOT SO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT A DREAMS A COUPLE WEWON'T ASKE ME WHAT THEIR DREAMS MEANT A LOOK OUNYMEN KNOW WHAT MY DREAMS MEAN HALF THE TIME AM IY A OCCASIONALLY WILL WAKE UP FROM A DREAM AND REMEMBER IT IF YOU WANT TO REMEMBER YOUR DREAMS BETTER IF YOUR SOMEBODY WHO HAS A CHALLENGE IS REMEMBERING YOUR DREAMS YOU CAN SET YOUR ALARMS THAT YOU WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE OF THESE NINETY MINUTE CYCLES WHICH TOWARD MORNING TEND TO BE OCCUPIED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY BY REM SLEEP REMEMBER EARLY IN THE NIGHT YOU HAVE LESS REMSLEEP THAN LATER IN THE NIGHT BUT YOU WANT TO GET AS MUCH SLEEP AS A YOU CAN CAUSE THAT'S HEALTHY SO I DO'TNOTHY WONT AWAKE YOURSELF UP SOME PEOPLE FIND THAT WRITING DOWN THEIR THOUGHTS IMMEDIATELY FIRST THING IN THE MORNING ALLOWS THEM TO RELATER SPONTANEOUSLY REMEMBER THEIR DREAM THEY HAD THEIR SOME LITERATURE ON THAT THE MEANING OF DREAMS IS A LITTLE BIT A CONTROVERSIAL SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE THEY HAVE STRONG MEANING OTHER PEOPLE AM BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN BE JUST SPONTANEOUS FIRING OF NURANS THAT WERE ACTIVE A IN A THE WAKING STATE UM AND DON'T HAVE ANY MEANING THEY'RE GOOD DATA TO SHOW THAT WHEN YOU LEARN SPACIAL A NEW SPACIAL ENVIRONMENTS THAT THERE'S A REPLAY OF THOSE ENVIRONMENTS I'M SO CALL PLACE CELLS THAT FIRE IN YOUR BRAIN ONLY WHEN YOU ENTER A PARTICULAR ENVIRONMENT THAT THOSE ARE REPLAYED IN SLEEP IN ALMOST DIRECT FASHION TO THE WAY THAT A THINGS WERE ACTIV ATED WHEN YOU WERE LEARNING THAT SPACIAL TAST DREAMS ARE FASCINATING THERE YOU NOW WEARE PARALYZED TRING DREAMS WHICH BRINGS US TO ANOTHER QUESTION SOMEBODY ASKED ABOUT SLEEP PARALYSIS A WE ARE PARALYZED FOR MUCH OF OUR SLEEP SO CALLED AKTONIOUT SO PRESUMABLY SO WE DON'T ACT OUT OUR DREAMS SOME PEOPLE WAKE UP AND THERRE STILL PARALYZED I'VE ACTUALLY HAD THIS HAPPEN TO ME NOT VERY MANY TIMES BUT A FEW TIMES AND THEN THEY JOLT THEMSELVES AWAKE AND IT ACTUALLY IS QUITE TERIFYING I COULD SAY FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE TO WAKE UP BE WIDE AWAKAND YOU CANNOT MOVE YOUR BODY AT ALL IT'S A REALLY QUITE FRIGHTENING THER'RE COUPLE THINGS THAT WILL INCREASE THE A INTRUSION OF ATONIA INTO THE WAKEFUL STATE WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY MEANS YOU'RE WAKING UP BUT YOU CAN'T A YOU CAN'T MOVE ONE IS MARIWUANA T H C I'M NOT A MARIANA SMOKER AM I'M NOT A A COPPER I DON'T KNOW THE LEGALITY WHERE YOU LIVE SO I'M NOT SAYING ONE THING OR ANOTHER ABOUT MARIAN I'M JUST AM THE FACT I HAD THAD EXPERIENCE A WITHOUT MARIWUANA MEANS THAT IT CAN HAPPEN REGARDLESS BUT MARIWANA SMOKERS FOR WHATEVER REASON MAY BE HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE CANABANOID RECEPTORS AM OR THE CERETONIAN RECEPTORS DOWNSTREAM OF THE MOTOR PATHWAYS I DON'T KNOW AMI COUN FIND ANY LITERATURE ON THIS BUT MARIUANA SMOKERS REPORT HIGHER FREQUENCY OF THIS A CAN A PARALYSIS AND WAKEFULNESS A AS YOU TRANSITION FROM SLEEP TO WAKEFULNESS I SUPPOSE PROBABLY ONE COULD LEARNE TO GET COMFORTABLE WITH IT OF FOR ME IT WAS TERRIFYING CAUSE I'M JUST USED TO BE ABLE TO MOVE MY LIMBS FORTUNATELY AND I WASN'T ABLE TO AND IT IT'S QUITE A AM A QUITE A THING LET ME TELL YOU OK SOME OTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT NEURO PLASTICITY SO THE OTHER FORM OF NARO PLASTOSY IS NOT THE NORAL PLASTICITY THAT YOURE AMPLIFYING BY LISTENING TO TONES OR AM SMELLING ODORS IND SLEEP BUT THE NERO PLASTOSEY THAT YOU CAN ACCESS WITH NONSLEEP DEEP REST SO ENESTY ARE NONSLEEP DEEP REST AS WELL AS SHORT TWENTY MINUTE NAPS WHICH ARE VERY CLOSE TO NONSLEEP DEEP REAST BECAUSE PEOPLE RARELY DROP INTO DEEP STATES OF SLEEP DURING SHORT NAPS UNLESS THEIRE VERY SLEEP TO PRIVED ENESTY ARE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE RATES OF LEARNING WHEN DONE FOR TWENTY MINUTE BOUTS FOR APROXTO MATCH AN APPROXIMATELY NINETY MINUTE BOUT OF LEARNING SO WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT NINETY MINUTE CYCLS ARE THESE ALTRADIAN CYCLES THAT IAVE TALKED ABOUT PREVIOUSLY AND WE TEND TO LEARN VERY WELL BY TAKING A NINETY MINUTE CYCEL TRANSITIONING INTO SOME FOCUS MODE EARLY IN THE CYCE WENTS HARD TO FOCUS AND THEN DEEP FOCUS AND AND LEARNING FEELS ALMOST LIKE AGITATION AND STRAIN AND THEN BY THE END OF THAT NINETY MINUTE CYCHEL BECOMES VERY HARD TO MAINTAIN FOCUS AND LEARN MORE INFORMATION THERE'S A STUDY PUBLISH AN SELL REPORTS LAST YEAR GREAT JOURNAL A EXCELLENT PAPER SHOWING THAT TWENTY MINUTE NAPS OR LIGHT SLEEP OF THE SORT OF NON SLEEP DEEP REST TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER OR CLOSE TO IT DOES NHAVE TO BE IMMEDIATELY AFTER YOU FINISH THE LAST SENTENCE OF LEARNING OR WHATEVER IT IS OR OR BAR OF MUSIC BUT YOU KNOW COUPLE MINUTES AFTER TRANSITIONING TO A PERIOD OF OF NON SLEEP DEEP REST WHERE YOU'RE TURNING OFF THE ANALYSIS OF DURATION PATH AND OUTCOME HAS BEEN SHOWN TO ACCELERATE LEARNING TO A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE BOTH THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION AND THE RETENSION OF THAT INFORMATION SO THAT'S PRETTY COOL BECAUSE THIS IS A A COST FREE DRUG FREE WAY OF ACCELERATING LEARNING WITHOUT HAVING TO GET MORE SLEEP BUT SIMPLY BY INTRODUCING THESE TWENTY MINUTE BOUTS I WOULD ENCOURAGE PEOPLE IF THEY WANT TO TRY THIS TO CONSIDER THE TWENTY MINUTES PUR EVERY NINETY MINUTES OF ULL TREATY IN LEARNING CYCL THERE YOUR INCORPORATING A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT NERO SCIENCE BACT A TOOLS NINETY NUTE PCYCELS FOR FOCUST LEARNING COULD BE MOTOR COULD BE COGNATIVE COULD BE MUSICAL WHATEVER AND THEN TRANSITION TO A TWENTY MINUTE NON SLEEP DEEP REST PROTOCOL THIS ONE ACUS THE FACT THAT IN LAST EPISODE IN THE CAPTION ON YOU TWO WE PROVIDED LINKS TO TWO DIFFERENT YOK AN NIDRA NON SLEEP DEEP REST PROTOCALS AS WELLS HYPNOSIS PROTOCALS THAT ARE CLINICALLY BACKED FROM MY COLLIDAVID S PEAGLE AT AM STAMPHORD PSYCHOTRY DEPARTMENT M ALL THOSE RESOURCES ARE FREE THERE ARE ALSO A LOT OF OTHER HYPNOSIS SCRIPTS OUT THERE I LIKE THE ONES FROM MICHAEL CEELY S E A L I THINK IT'S EWILOH MAY BE IT'S JUST ELWHY YOU FIND THEM EASILY ON YOU TO CLINICAL HYPNOSIS SCRIPTS MEANING NOT STAGE HYPNOSIS DARE NOT DESIGNE TO GET YOU TO DO ANYTHING IN FACT THEIRE JUST DESIGN TO HELP REWIRE YOUR BRAIN CIRCUITRY NOW HOW DOES HYPNOSIS WORK THAT WAY IS HAS A LOT TO DO WITH SLEEP BECAUSE IT ENGAGES NER APLASTICITY BY BRINGING TOGETHER TWO THINGS THAT NORMALLY ARE CEPARATE FROM ONE ANOTHER ONE IS THE ALERT FOCUS WEHTEFUL STATE WHERE YOU ACTIVATE THE LEARNING AND THEN THERE'S THE DEEP REST WHERE THE ACTUAL RECONFIGURATION OF THE NURONS AND SYNAPSIS TAKES PLACE HYPNOSIS BRINGS BOTH THE THE FOCUS AND THE DEEP REST COMPONENT INTO THE SAME COMPARTMENT OF TIME ITS A VERY UNIQUE STATE IN THAT WAY SO HYPNOSIS CAN A MAXIMIZES THE LEARNING BOUT AND THE NON SLEEP DEEP REAST BOUT AND COMBINES THEM BUT OF COURSE THAT REQUIRE SOME GUIDANCE A FROM A SCRIPT OR FROM A HYPNOTIST CLINICALLY A A TRAINED HYPNOTIST AND IT BECOMES HARD TO ACQUIRE DETAILED INFORMATION IT'S MORE ABOUT SHIFTS IN STATE LIKE FEAR TO A STATES OF CALM OR AM SMOKING TO QUITTING SMOKING ANXIETY AROUND A TRAMA TO RELEASE OF ANXIETY ROUND A TROMET RATHER THAN SPECIFIC INFORMATION LEARNED IN HYPNOSIS OKI SO HYPNOSIS SEEMS MORE ABOUT MODULATING THE CIRCUITS THAT UNDER LIE STATE AS POST A SPECIFIC INFORMATION ALTHOUGH I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF THERE WEREN'T CERTAIN FORMS OF HYPNOSIS THAT COULD INCREASE RETENTION AND LEARNING OF SPECIFIC INFORMATION BUT I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY OF THOSE PROTOCOLS OUT THERE YET WHICH BRINGS US TO THE NEXT THING ABOUT LEARNING AN PLASTICITY WHICH IS NEUTROPICS A CH A SMART DRUGS AH THI'S A BIG TOPIC THAT SIG WAS A A SIGH OF CONCERN ABOUT HOW TO ADDRESS NEUTROPICS IN A A THOROUGH ENOUGH BUT THOUGHTFUL ENOUGH WAY LOOK I'VE A LOT OF THOUGHTS ABOUT NEUTROPICS UM FIRST OF ALL IT MEANS SMART DRUGS I BELIEVE AM AN I DON'T LIKE THAT PHRASE BECAUSE LET'S JUST TAKE A STEP BACK AND THINK ABOUT EXERCISE OYOU SAY I WANT TO BE MORE FHYSICALLY FIT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN DOES IT MEAN I WOULD ASK FOR MORE SPECIFICITY I SAY DO YOU WANTO BE STRONGER OKA MAY BOU NEED TO LIFT TEVEROR OBJECES PROGRESSIVELY DO YOU WANT MORE ENDURANCE VERY DIFFERENT PROTOCALL TO ACCESS EN DURANCE DO YOU WANT FLEXIBILITY DO YOU WANT EXPLOSIVENESS OR SUPPLENESS HUGE RANGE OF THINGS THAT WE CALL PHYSICAL FITNESS MAY BE WANT ALL OF THOSE IF WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EMOTIONAL FITNESS WE WOULD SAY WELL IN ABILITY TO FEEL EMPATHY BUT PROBABLY ALSO TO DISENGAGE FROM EMPATHY BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE TETHERE TO OTHER PEOPLES EMOTIONS ALL THE TIME THAT'S NOT HEALTHY EITHER YOU WOULD THINK ABOUT BEING ABLE TO ACCESS A RANGE OF EMOTIONS BUT FOR SOME PEOPLE THEIR RANGE INTO THE SADNESS REGIME IS REALLY QUITE VAST BUT THEIR RANGE INTO THE HAPPINESS REGIME MIGHT BE KIND OF LIMITED FOR OTHER PEOPLE OR IN A MANIC STATE IT MIGHT BE THEY CAN ACCESS ALL THE HAPPY STUFF BUT NOT THE SADDER STUFF SO AM YOU NOW SPEAKING BY WAY OF ANALOGY HERE BUT IF WE SAY YOU KNOW WE'RE TO TALKING ABOUT COGNITIVE AND YOU KNOW COGNIVABILITIES WE HAVE TO ASK I CREATIVITY MEMORY YOU KNOW WE TEND TO A SOCIATE INTELLIGENCE WITH MEMORY I THINK THIS GOES BACK TO LIKE SPELLING BEES OR SOMETHING THE ABILITY RETAIN A LOT OF INFORMATION UM AND JUST REGURGUTATE INFORMATION WI WHICH WILL GET YOU SOME DISTANCE IN SOME SOME DISCIPLINES OF LIFE BUT IT WON'T ALLOW YOU CREATIVE THINKING IT'S NECESSARY FOR CREATIVE THINKING YOU NED A KNOWLEDGE BASE RIGHT YOU CAN'T JUST LOOK UP EVERYTHING ON GUGAL DESPITE WHAT YOU KNOW CERTAIN EDUCATORS OR SO CALLED EDUCATOR SAY YOU NEED A DATABASE SO THAT YOU COULD HAVE THE RAW MATERIALS WITH WHICH TO BE CREATIVE SO NECESSARY TO HAVE MEMORY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT TO BE CREATIVE RIGHT THE CREATIVE COULD HAVE A POOR MEMORY FOR CERTAIN THINGS BUT CERTAINLY NOT FOR EVERYTHING THEY CAN'T HAVE INTERROGRATE AND RETROGRATE EMNESIA THEY'D BE LIKE THE GOLDFISH THAT EVERY TIME AROUND THE TANK IT A YOU KOW CAN'T REMEMBER WHERE IT'S THAT AS YOU DON'T KNOW THAT THEY'VE EVER DONE THAT EXPERIMENT BY THE WAY BUT YOU KNOW SO NO DISRESPECT TO GOLDFISH BUT YOU KNOW SO YOU GET THE IDEA YOU'VE GOT CREATIVITY YOU HAVE MEMORY YOU HAVE THE ABILIIATASKS WHICH RIGHT YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO UM STRATEGY DEVELOP IN STRATEGY IMPLEMENT SO THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THE CONCEPT OF A NEUTROPIC OR SMART DRUG IS IT'S NOT SPECIFIC AS TO WHAT COGNITIVE A ALGARITHM YOU'RE TRYING TO ENGAGE WE NEED MORE SPECIFICITY THAT SAID THERE ARE ELEMENTS TO LEARNING THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED HERE BEFORE THEY ARE VERY CONCRETE THINGS LIKE THE ABILITY TO FOCUS AND PUT THE BLINDERS ON TO EVERYTHING ELSE THAT'S HAPPENING IN AROUND YOU ANY IN YOUR HEAD MAINLY RIGHT DISTRACTIONS ABOUT THINGS YOU SHOULD BE DOING COULD BE DOING YOUR MIGHT BE DOING AND FOCUS ON WHAT YOU NEED TO DO AND THEN THAT'S REQUIRED FOR TRIGGERING THAT I SEETO COLING NOT NERMODULATOR THAT WILL THEN ALLOW YOU TO HIGHLIKHE THE PARTICULAR SYNAPSES THAT WILL THEN LATER CHANGE IN SLEEP SO NO NEUTROPIC ALLOWS YOU TO BY PASS THE NEED FOR SLEEP AN DEEP REST THAT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND SO I DAY DREAM ABOUT A DAY WHEN PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS COMPOUNDS THAT ARE SAFE THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO LEARN BETTER MEANING TO ACCESS INFORMATION FOCUS BETTER AS WELL AS TO SLEEP BETTER AND ACTIVATE THE PLASTICITY FROM THE LEARNING BOUT RIGHT NOW MOST NEUTROPICS TEND TO BUNDLE A BUNCH OF THINGS TOGETHER MOST OF THEM INCLUDES SOME FORM OF STIMULANT KAFFINE EPISODE TO TILL YOU MORE PROBABLY THAN YOU EVERYONE TO KNOW ABOUT CAFINE A DENACINE AND HOW THAT WORK SO REFER THERE FOR HOW CAFFINE WORKS BUT STIMULANTS WILL ALLOW YOU TO INCREASE FOCUS UP TO A PARTICULAR POINT IF YOU HAVE TO LITTLE STO ALERTNESS IN YOUR SYSTEM YOU CAN'T FOCUS TO MUCH HOWEVER YOU START TO CLIFF IN FOCUS DRIFTS OCHE SO YOU CANT JUST IN JEST MORE STIMULANT TO BE MORE FOCUS IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY MOST NEUTROPICS ALSO INCLUDE THINGS THAT INCREASE OR A DESIGND TO INCREASE A SEATOF COLING THINGS LIKE ALPHAC P C AND OTHER THINGS OF THAT SORT AND INDEED THERE SOME EVIDENCE THAT THEY CAN INCREASE O SEATO COLING I REFER YOU AGAIN TO EXAMINE DOT COM THE WEBSITE TO VALUATE ANY SUPPLEMENTS ARE COMPOUNDS FOR THEIR SAFETY AND THEIR EFFECTS IN HUMANS AND ANIMALS FREE WEBSITE AS WELL AS WITH LYNKTHS TO STUDIES SO WE NEED THE FOCUS COMPONENT WE NEED THE ALERTNESS COMPONENT THE ALERTNESS COMPONENT COMES FROM EPINEPERAN TRADITIONALLY FROM KAFFINE STIMULATION THE AETOCOLING STIMULATION TRADITIONALLY COMES FROM COLING DONERS OR ALPHOCY P C THINGS O THAT SORT AND THEN YOU WOULD WANT TO HAVE SOME SORT OF OFFSWITCH BECAUSE ANYTHING THAT'S CAN A REALLY STIMULATE YOUR ALERTNESS THAT THEN PROVIDES A CRASH THAT CRASH IS NOT A CRASH INTO THE DEEP KIND OF RESTFUL SLUMBER THAT YOU WOULD WANT FOR LEARNING IT'S A CRASH INTO THE KIND OF AM LET'S JUST CALL IT LOPSIDED SLEEP MEANING IT'S DEEP SLEEP BUT IT LAC CERTAIN SPINDLES AND OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE PHYSIOLOGY SLEEP SPINDLES THAT A THAT REALLY ENGAGE THE LEARNING PROCESS IN THE RECONFIGURATION OF SYNAPSIS SO WRIGTE NOW MY STANDS ON NEUTROPICS IS THAT MAY BE MAY BE FOR OCCASIONAL USE PROVIDED IT SAFE FOR YOU I'M NOT RECOMMENDING IT BUT IN GENERAL IT TENDS TO USE MORE OF A SHOCKGUN APPROACH THAN IS PROBABLY TAN O BE USEFUL FOR LEARNING AND MEMORY IN THE LONG RUN LOT IF YOU LASTS ABOUT MODAPHANIL OR ARMODAPHANIL WHICH WAS JUS INE FOR TREATMENT OF NARCALEPSIS SO WRIT THERE TELLS YOU IT'S A STIMULANT AND YES THERE IS EVIDENCE IT WILL IMPROVE LEARNING MEMORY MODAPHNO IS VERY EXPENSIVE LAST TIME I CHECKED ARMODAPHINAL I THINK HIS SLEE A RECENT RELEASED A GENERIC VERSION OF THIS THAT'S FAR LESS EXPENSIVE MOST THESE THINGS LOOK A LOT LIKE IMPHETOMINE AND MANY OF THEM HAVE A THE POTENTIAL FOR DICTION AU OR COMME HABIT FORMING A BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY A LOT OF THOSE THINGS ALSO CAN CREATE METABOLIC EFFECTS BY DESRUPTION TO INSOLENT RECEPTORS AND SO FORTH SO YOU WANT A APPROACH THOSE WITH A STRONG SENSE OF CAUTION NOW THERE ARE THE MILDER THINGS THAT ACT AS NEUTROPICS T  I MENTION SOME OF THEM LIKE ALPHIC P C AUM SOME PEOPLE LIKE GINCO GINKO GIVES ME VICIOUS HEADACHES SO I DON'T TAKE IT SO YOU KNOW PEOPLE REALLY DIFFER LAST UM UPODCASTS I RECOMMEND MAGNESIUM THREE IN EIGHTE IF YOU WERE EXPLORING SUPPLEMENTS I NOT RECOMMENDING ANYTHING DIRECTLY I'M JUST TING IF YOU'RE EXPLORING SUPPLEMENTS MAGNESIUM THREE IN ATE SEEMS AMONG THE MAGNESIUMS A TO BE ONE OF THE MORE A BIOVAILABLE AND USEFUL FOR SLEEP I RECOMMENDED ACTUALLY TO A GOOD FRIEND OFMINE IT GAVE HIM AT VERY LOW DOSE HE HAD A STOMACH ISSUES WITH IT HE JUST HAD A SIMPLY STOP TAKING IT SO THERE'S VERY ABILITY THERE HE JUST IT GAVE HIM  SOME STOMACH CRAMPING IN JUST DIDN'T FEEL GOOD ON IT STOPPED IT HE FELT BETTER OTHER PEOPLE TAKE MAGNESIUM THREE IN A AND FEEL GREAT I WAS ASKED DO MAGNESIUM NEED TO BE TAKEN WITH OR WITHOUT FOOD DAYTIME OR BEFORE SLEEP IF YOU'RE GOING TO GO THAT ROUTE IT SHOULD BE TAKEN THIRTY TO SIXTY MENTS BEFORE SLEEP CAUSE ITS DESIGN TO MAKE YOU SLEEPY AND I'M NOT AWARE THAT IT HAS TO BE TAKEN WITH FOOD BUT AGAIN ALL THIS HAS TO BE RUN BY YOUR DOCTOR AND THIS IS YOUR HEALTH CARE AM TO TO GOVERN NOT A THESE ARE NOT STRICT RECOMMENDATION SO LOOK IN TO IT BUT AM MAGNESIUM THREE N AT MOST PEOPLE I RECOMMEND IT TO HAVE BENEFIT FROM IT TREMENDOUSLY SOME PEOPLE CAN'T TOLERATE IT S YOU HAVE TO FIND OUT THERE WERE NO MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT OTHER SUPPLEMENTS DESING TO ACCESS DEP SLEEP IN PART TO ACCESS NORAL PLASTICITY BUT NOW I'M JUST SORT OF TRANSITIONING FROM NORAL PLASTICITY TO THESE COMPOUNDS THAT CAN REGULATE SLEEP ONE OF THEM THAT I DISCUSSE AT THE END OFTH LAST POTCASSICA LOTIC QUESTIONS ABOUT ATS APIGENIN A P I G E AND I N APIGENIN IF YOU LOOK IN THE LITERATURE THE WAY IT WORKS IS HAT INCREASE SYSTEM OF THE ENZIMES ASSOCIATED WITH GABOMETABOLISM IT ACTUALLY GABAS AN INHIBITORY NOR TRANSMITTER IT'S THE NERO TRANSMITTER THAT IS INCREASED AFTER A COUPLE ALCA A DRINKS CONTAINING ALCOHOL AND THAT SHUT DOWN THE FOREBRAIN UM APIGENIN IS A DEDERIVITIVE OF THE CAMOMILE I THINK THAT THE PROPER PRONUNCIATION OF THIS IS MATRI CARIA CAMOMILA ALTHOUGH I WAS FEEL LIKE ISHUB USING A SPANISH ACCENT WHENEERI A NORI SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT UM OTHER RELATED THINGS THAT IMPACT THE GABA SYSTEM AND INCREASE GABAR THINGS LIKE PASSION FLOWER WHICH IS PASSI FLORA INCUDAT THE DON'T KNOW WHY THE ITALIAN IS AT ITALIAN ANYWAY MY ITALIAN COLLEAGUES PLEASE FORGIVE ME I'VE OM SOME VERY CLOSE ITALIAN O FRIENDS IN COLLEAGUES IN GENERL I BUTCHER THE ITALIAN SORRY IN ANY EVENT APIGENIN AND A PASSION FLOWER FOUND IN A LOT OF A A LOT OF SUPPLEMENTS DESIN TO INCREASE SLEEPINESS IN SLEEP BECAUSE AND THEY WORK PRESUMABLY BECAUSE THEY INCREASE GABA ACTUALLY THEY WORK ON CHLORIDE CHANNELS RATHER THAN GIVE YOU A WHOLE LECTUREON A MEMBRING BILPHYSICS AND NURONS I'LL JUST SAY THAT WHEN NURONS ARE REALLY ACTIVE IT'S BECAUSE SODIUM IONS SALT RUSHES INTO THE CELLS AND CAUSES THEM TO FIRE ELECTRICALLY THE SELLS TEN TO BECOME LESS ACTIVE AS MORE CHLORIDE WHICH IS A NEGATIVELY CHARGED ION OM ISIPRTLY TAKING SOME OF YOU BACK TO THE EITHER THE A WONDERFUL TIMES OR TRAMAS OF HIGH SCHOOL PHYSICS A THE CHLORIDE IS NEGATIVELY CHARGED TO IT TENDS TO MAKE SELLS LESS A ELECTRICALLY POSITIVE CAUS CARRIES A NEGATIVE CHARGE AND HYPEROPOLARIZES THE NURON SO APIGENIN WORKS THROUGH THESE INCREASING THE ACTIVITY THIESE CHLORIDE CHANNELS PASSION FLOWER IN WORKS BY INCREASING TE ACTIVITIESE CHLORID CHANNELS AND GABA TRANSMISSION IT TENDS TO INCREASE THIS IN HIBATORY NOR TRANSMITTER THAT SHUTS OFF AR THINKING ARE ANALYSIS OF DURATION PATH AND OUTCOME SO IF YOU CAN EXPLORE THESE THINGS I SUGGEST YOU AT LEAST KNOW HOW THEY WORK YOU AT LEAST GO TO A EXAMINED O COM THAT YOU TALKD YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT THEM SOME PEOPLE ASKED ABOUT SERATONAN FOR GETTING TO SLEEP AND STAYING ASLEEP NOW I UNDERSTAND THE RATIONAL HERE JUST LIKE I UNDERSTAND THE RATIONAL OF TAKING SOMETHING LIKE MECUNOPURIANS OR EL TOPA TO INCREASE TOPOMINE BUT SOMETIMES WHAT WORKS ON PAPER DOESN'T REALLY WORK IN THE REAL WORLD I PERSONALLY HAVE TRIED TAKING A SUPPLEMENT WHICH WAS A ALTRIPTOPHAN WHICH IS THE CRECURSERTO SERATONAN OR FIVE H T P WHICH IS DESIGN TO INCREASE WHIP IT IS SARATONAN BASICALLY YOUR ARE JUST A WONE BIE CHEMICAL STEP AWAY FROM ACTUATAKING ACTUAL SERATONAN AND ABIONIST THE SLEEP THAT I HAD A WITH INCREASE SARATONAN BY WAY OF TRIP OFANOR FIVE H T P WAS DREADFUL I FELL ASLEEP ALMOST IMMEDIATELY YOU SAY WITL THAT'S GREAT AND NINETY MINUTES LATER I WOKE UP AND I COULDN'T SLEEP ALMOST FOR FORTY EIGHT HOURS NOW THAT WAS ME I HAVE A PRETTY SENSITIVE SYSTEM TO CERTAIN THINGS AND NOT THE OTHER THINGS SOME PEOPLE LOVE THESE THINGS SO YOU REALLY HAVE TO BE THOUGHTFUL AND EXPLORE THEM WITH THAT KIND OF AWARENESS OF OF BEING THOUGHTFUL AND REALIZING THAT WHAT WORKS FOR YOU MYT NOT WORK FOR EVERYBODY IN WHAT WORKS FOR EVERYBODY MIY NOT WORK FOR YOU OKE I LIKE TO CONTINUE BY TALKING ABOUT THE ROLL OF TEMPERATURE IN SLEEP ACCESSING SLEEP STAYING ASLEEP AND WAKEFULNESS FIRST I WANT A TELL A JOKE BECAUSE I THINK THIS JOKE REALLY CAPTURE SOME OF THE CRITICAL THINGS TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT ANY SELF EXPERIMENTATION THAT YOU MIGHT DO SO THIS IS A STORY THAT WAS TOLD TO ME BY A COLLEGUE OF MINE WHOS NOW PROFESSOR OF CALTAC NOT TO BE NAMED SO THERE'S A SCIENTIST AND THEY'RE IN THEIR LAB AND THEIRE TRY AND UNDERSTAND HOW THE NERVOUS SYSTEM WORKS SO THEY GO OVER TO A TANK AND THEY PICK UP A FROG ND THEY TAKE THE FROG THEY PUT IT DOWN ON THE TABLE AND THEY CLAP AND THE FROG JUMPS THEY THINK FOR A WHILE THEY PICK UP THE FROG CAN THEY GO OVER THE CABINET AND THEY TAKE OUT LO BIT OF A PARALYTIC DRUG AND THEY INJECT IT LOCALLY INTO THE BACK LEG SET IT DOWN THEY CLAP AND THE FROG JUMPS BUT IT CUN LIKE JUMPS TO THE SIDE A LITTLE BIT THEY PICK IT UP THEY NJECT THE PARALYTIC INTO THE OTHER BACK LEG THEY CLAP AGAIN THE FROG JUMPS BUT IT REALLY DOESN'T JUMP WELL THAT TIME CON DRAGS ITSELF FORWARD SO THEY PICK IT UP AND THEY INJECT THE PARALYTIC INTO THE REMAINING TWO LEGS THEY SET IT DOWN AND THEY CLAP  THE FROG DOESN'T JUMP THEYAL MY GOODNESS THE LEGS ARE USED FOR HEARING NOW THEY PUBLISH THE PAPER PAPER COMES OUT IN A GREAT JOURNAL NEWS RELEASES THE REALLY BIG DEAL THEIR CAREER TAKES OFF TWENTY YEARS LATER A REALLY SMART GRADUATES TODNT COMES LONG AND SAYS YEH BUT THAT'S LOSS OF FUNCTION DOESN'T REALLY SHOW GAIN A FUNCTION SO LET'S TAKE THE CLOSER LOOK SO THY REPEAT THE FIRST EXPERIMENT AND CHECKS OUT EVERYTHING HAPPENS THE SAME WAY BUT THEN THEY TAKE THE FROG AND THEY INJECT A DRUG INTO ALL FOUR LEGS THAT TURNS OFF THE PARALYTIC RIGHT'S AN ANTAGONIST THEY SET THE FROG DOWN THEY CLAP AND THE FROG JUMPS THEYAL MY GOODNESS IT'S TRUE THE LEGS REALLY ARE FOR HEARING NOW FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT THAT THIS IS NOT TO ILLUSTRATE THAT SCIENCE IS NOT A GOOD PRACTICE IT IS WE NEED TO DO LOSS OF FUNCTION AND GAIN IN FUNCTION EXPERIMENTS BUT JUST TO SHOW THAT CORROLATION AND CAUSATION IS COMPLICATED YOU NEED TO DO A VARIETY OF CONTROLL EXPERIMENTS AND YOU REALLY INTO FIGURE OUT WHILL WORKS FOR YOU AND SO WHILE SCIENCE CAN PROVIDE ANSWERS ABOUT WHAT WORKS UNDER VERY CONTROLLED CONDITIONS IT DOESN'T AND CAN NEVER ADDRESS ALL THE SITUATIONS IN WHICH A GIVING COMPOUND TO GIV IN PRACTICE WILL OR WON'T WORK AND IT'S NOT JIS INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY IS THAT THEIR NUMBER DIFFERENT FACTORS YOU ALL OF COURSE KNOW THAT LIGHT CAN ACTIF EIGHT AND SHIFT YOUR CIRCATIAN RHYTHM BUT SO CAN EXERCISE SO CON FOOD THE LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS AN IMPORTANT ONE WHICH IS THAT NO FROGS WE'RE HURT IN THE TELLING OF THIS JOKEOCA SO LET'S CONTINUE I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TEMPERATURE TEMPERATURE IS SUPERINTERESTING AS IT RELATES TO CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS AND WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEP FIRST LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO OUR BODY TEMPERATURE ACROSS EACH TWENTY FOUR HOUR CYCLE IN GENERAL OURE TEMPERATURE TENDS TO BE LOWEST RIGHT AROUND FOUR A M AND STARTS CREEPING UP AROUND SIX A M AIGHT A M AND PEIK SOME TIME BETWEEN FOUR P M AND SIX P M NOW THAT VERIES FROM PERSON A PERSON BUT IN GENERAL IF WE WERE TO CONTINUOUSLY MONETOR OCCASIONALLY MONOR TEMPERATURE THAT'S WHAT WE WOULD SEE NOW IT'S INTERESTING IS THAT EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY LIGHT CUES OR MEAL CUES WE WOULD HAVE A SHIFT WE WOULD HAVE AN OSCILLATION OR RHYTHM IN OUR TEMPERATURE THAT WOULD GO FROM HIGH TO LOWL THIS IS WHY THE IDEA THAT WE'RE ALL NINETY SIX POINT EIGHT AND THAT'S OUR CORRECT TEMPERTURE FORGET THAT THAT IS NO LONGER TRUE T NEVER WAS TRUE IT DEPENDS ON WHAT TIME A DAY YOU MEASURE TEMPERATURE HOWEVER THERE IS A RANGE WHICH IS WITHIN NORMAL RANGE I THINK MOST OF US ASSOCIATE FEVER WITH SOMEWHERE AROUND A HUNDR AT A HUNDRED ONE HUNDRED THREE THAT'S CONCERNING AND WE WOUL BE VERY CONCERNED IF TEMPERTURE DROP TOO LOW AS WELL THE WAY THAT THE TEMPERATURE RHYTHM THAT'S IN DOGINESS THAT'S WITHIN US AND RHYTHMIC NO MATTER WHAT THE WAY IT GETS ANCHORED TO THE THE PATTERN I DESCRIBE BEFORE OF BEING LOWEST AT FORE I M AND INCREASING AGAIN AROUND OM YOU KNOW THROUGH THE DAY UNTIL ABOUT FOR TO SIX P M IS BY WAY OF IN TRAINMENT OR MATCHING TO SOME EXTERNAL CUE WHICH IS ALMOST ALWAYS GOING TO BE LIGHT BUT ALSO EX ERCISE NOW YOU MAY HAVE EXPERIENCE THIS TEMPERATURE RHYTHM AND HOW QUICKLY IT CAN BECOME UNIN TRAINED OR IT CAN FALL OUT OF IN TRAINMENT HERE'S AN EXPERIMENT I WOULDN'T WANT YOU TO DO BUT YOU'VE PROBABLY EXPERIENCE THIS BEFORE WHERE YOU WAKE UP IT'S SUNNY OUTSIDE AND MAY BE HAVE SOME MEMAL OR SOMETHINGS TO TAKE CARE OF OR MAYBE DIDN'T SLEEP THAT WELL THE NGHT BEFORE AND SO YOU STAY IN DOORS OU DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR BREAKFAST YOU DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING ABOUT YOU'RE WITHIN HOME TEMPERATURE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT AND SOMEWHERE RED AROUND TEN OR ELEVEN O'CLOCK YOU START FEELING KIND OF CHILLED LIKE YOUR COLD WELL WHAT HAPPEN WAS THE OSCILLATORS THE CLOCKS IN YOUR VARIOUS TISSUES THAT ARE GOVERNED BY TEMPERATURE AND CIRCANIAN RHYTHM ARE STARTING TO SPLIT A WAY FROM YOUR CENTRAL CLOCK MECHANISMS SO IT'S ACTUALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOUR TEMPERATURE MATCH DAYLENGTH NOW THERE'S ANOTHER WAY IN WHICH TEMPERATURE MATCHES OR DAYTIME SCUES ME THERE'S ALSO IMPORTANT WAY IN WHICH TEMPERATURE MATCHES DAYLENGTH IN GENERAL AS DAYS GET LONGER IT TENDS TO BE HOTTER OUT NOT ALWAYS BUT IN GENERAL THAT'S THE WAY IT IS AND AS DAYS GET SHORTER IT TENDS TO BE COLDER OUTSIDE SO TEMPERATURE AND DAYLENGTH ARE ALSO LINKED METABOLICALLY THERE LINKED BY LOGICALLY THE'RE  THERE LINED EXCUSE ME AND ATMOSPHERICALLY THE'RE LINKED FOR THE REASON THT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE ABOUT DURATION OF DAYLENGTH AND OTHER CLIMATE FEATURES AND SO FORTH SO ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL THINGS ABOUT SETTING YOUR CIRCANIAN RHYTHM PROPERLY IS THAT YOUR TEMPERATURE WILL START TO FALL INTO A REGULAR RHYTHM AND THAT TEMPERATURE HAS A VERY STRONG EFFECT ON THINGS LIKE METABOLISM AND WHEN YOU WILL FEEL MOST WILLING AND INTERESTED IN EXERCISING TYPICALLY THE WILLINGNESS TO EXERCISE AND ENGAGE IN ANY KIND OF ACTIVITY MENTAL OR PHYSICA L IS GOING TO BE WHEN THAT RISIN TEMPERATURE IS STEEPEST WHEN THE SLOPE OF THAT LINE IS GREATEST THAT'S WHY THIRTY MINUTES AFTER WAKING IS ONE OF THOSE KEY WINDOWS AS WELL AS THREE HOURS AFTER WAKING AND THEN WHEN TEMPERATURE ACTUALLY PEAKS WHICH IS GENERALLY GENERALLY ABOUT ELEVEN HOURS AFTER WAKING SO THIS IS WHY WE SAY THAT TEMPERATURE AND CIRCANE RHYTHM ARE LINKED BUT THEIRE ACTUALY EVEN MORE LINKED THAN THAT WE'VE TALK BEFORE ABOUT HOW LIGHT ENTERS THE EYE TRIGGER'S ACTIVATION OF THESE MELONOPS AND CELLS WHICH THEN TRIGGER'S ACTIVATION OF THE SUPERCIS MATIC NUCLYAS THE MASTER CIRCADIAN CLOCK AND THEN I ALWAYS SAY THE MASTER CIRCANE CLOCK IN FORMS ALL THE CELLS AND TISSUES OF YOUR BODY AND PUTS THEM INTO A NICE COHESE OF RHYTHM BUT WHAT I'VE NEVER ANSWERED WAS HOW IT ACTUALLY PUTS THEM INTO THAT RHYTHM AND IT DOES IT TWO WAYS ONE IS IT SECREATES A PEPTIDE PEPTIZE JUST A LITTLE PROTINE THAT FLOATS THROUGH THE BLOOD STREAM AND SIGNALS TO THE CELLS OCA WHERE TUNING YOUR CLOCK CALICA A YOIN A WATCH STORE THE THE WATCH STORNER WOULD TUNE THE CLOCKS BUT THE OTHER WAY IS IT SYNCHRONIZES THE TEMPERATURE UNDER WHICH THOSE CELLS EXIST SO TEMPERATURE IS ACTUALLY THE EFFECTER OF THE CIRCADIAN RHYTHM NOW THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE BY WAY OF EXERCISE BY WAY OF EATING BUT ESPECIALLY BY WAY OF EXERCISE CAN STRARCH TO SHIFT OUR CIRCATIAN RHYTHM PRETTY DRAMATICALLY BUT LET'S EVEN GO TO AN MORE EXTREME EXAMPLE NOWADAYS THERE SOME INTEREST IN COLD SHOWERS AND ICE BATS NOT EVERYBODY IS DOING THIS I REALIZED PEOPLE SEEM TO EITHER LOVE THIS AR HATE THIS I DON'T MIND THE COLD DUNK THING I' I GET REGULAR ABOUT THIS FROM TIME TO TIME AND I'LL DO IT I HAVE BEEN DOING IT RECENTLY IT'S ALWAYS PAINFUL TO DO THE FIRST COUPLE TIMES THAN YOU GET CINDI USED TO IT HOWEVER I'VE TAKEN PEOPLE TO A COLD DON CERE AN ICE BATH I HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER WHO WOULDN'T GETIN LITERALLY PAST ER TOS OS LIKE THIS IS JUST TOO AVERSIVE FOR ME SOME PEOPLE REALLY LIKE THE COLD PEOPLE VERY TREMENDOUSLY GETTING INTO AN ICE BATH IS VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE YOU HAVE A REBOUND INCREASE IN THROMOGENESIS NOW YOU SHOULD KNOW FROM THE PREVIOUS EPISODE THAT AS THAT TEMPERATURE INCREASES IT WILL SHIFT YOUR CIRCATIAN RHYTHM AND WHICH DIRECTION IT SHIFTS OR CIRCADIAN RHYTHM WILL DEPEND ON WHETHER NOT YOU'R DOING IT DURING THE DAYTIME OR LATE IN THE DAY IF YOU DO IT AFTER EIGHT P M IT'S GOING TO MAKE YOUR DAY LONGER RIGHT BECAUSE YOUR BODY AND YOUR CENTRAL CLOCKS ARE USED TO TEMPERATURE GOING UP EARLY IN THE DAY AND THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND PIKING IN THE AFTERNOON IF YOU THEN INCREASE THAT FURTHER OR YOU SIMPLY INCREASE IT OVER ITS BASE LINE AT EIGHT P M AFTER TEMPERATURE WAS ALREADY FALLING EVEN IT'S JUST BY A HALF A DEGREE OR COUPLE DEGREES ER YOU DO THAT WITH EXERCISE DOESN'T AFTER YOU THE ICE BATH YOU ARE EXTENDING YOU ARE SHIFTING FORWARD YOU ARE PHASE DELAYING YOUR CLOCK YOU'RE CONVINCING YOUR CLOCK AND THEREFORE THE REST OF YOUR BODY THAT THE DAY IS STILL GOING RIGHT YOUYOU GIVING IT THE PERCEPTION THE CELLER AND PHYSIOLOGICAL PERCEPTION THAT THE DAY IS GETTING LONGER AND YOU WILL WANT TO NACTUALLY STAY UP LATER AND WAKE UP LATER NOW YOU MIGHT SAY WEIGH I DO AN ICE BATH LATE AT NIGHT AND I FEEL GREAT AND I FALL DEEPLY ASLEEP WELL COLD CANTRIGGER THE RELEASE OF MELOTONAN THERE'S A REBOUND INCREASE IN MELOTONAN SO THAT COULD BE THE CAUSE OF THAT EFFECT YOU HAVE TO SEE WHAT WORKS FOR YOU BUT IF YOU DO THE ICE BATH EARLY IN THE DAY AND THEN GET OUT YOU YOU WILL EXPERIENCE MORE RAPID RISE WOR COLD SHOW EARLY IN THE DAY A MORE RAPID RISE IN YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE THAT WILL PHASE ADVANCE YOUR CLOCK AND MAKE IT EASIER TO GET UP EARLY THE FOLLOWING DAY SO FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE HAVING TROUBLE GETTING UP AND THIS IS GOING O ALMOST OUNLAUGHABLE BUT A COLD SHOWER FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WILL WAKE YOU UP BUT THAT'S WAKING YOU UP IN THE SHORT TERM BECAUSE OF A DIFFERENT MECHANISM WHICH I'LL TALK ABOUT IN A MOMENT BUT IT ALSO A SHIFTING YOUR CLOCK IT'S PHASE ADVANCING YOUR CLOCK IN A WAY THAT MAKES YOU MORE LIKELY TO GET UP EARLIER THE NEXT DAY OK SO IN OTHER WORDS INCREASING YOUR TEMPERATURE BY GETTING IN AN ICE BATH WHICH OR COLD SHOWER WHICH OR EXERCISING WHICH CAUSES A COMPENSITORY INCREASE IN BODY TEMPERATURE THINK ABOUT THE NORMAL PATTERN OF BODY TEMPERATURE LOW AROUND FOR THIRTY FIVE A M STARTS TO PEAK RIGHT AROUND WAKING STAREXCUSE ME STARTS TO INCREASE RIGHT AROUND WAKING THEN STEEP SLOPE STEEP SLOPE TO A PEAK ROUND FOR TO SIX P M AND THEN DROPS OFF IF YOU INTRODUCE AN INCREASE IN BODY TEMPERATURE BY WAY OF COLD EXPOSURE EARLY IN THE DAY LET'S A SIX A M OR FIVE A M IF YOUR YOU KNOW MASSACISTIC ENOUGH TO GET INTO A COLD SHOWER AT THAT TIME MORE POWER TO YOU IT'S GOING TO MAKE YOU WANT TO WAKE UP ABOUT HALF HOUR TO AN HOUR EARLIER THE NEXT DAY THAN YOU NORMALLY WOULD WHEREAS IF YOU DO IT WHILE YOUR TEMPERATURE IS FALLING IT WILL TEND TO DELAY AND MAKE YOUR BODY PERCEIVE AS IF THE DAY IS GETTING LONGER THESE ARE HASE ADVANCES AND PHASE DELAYS WE ARE GOINGTO GET INTO THIS IN FAR MORE DETAIL WE TALK ABOUT JETLAG AN SHIFT WORK IN EPISODE FOR AS WELL AS OTHER OTHER THINGS BUT TEMPERATURE IS AGAIN IS NOT JUST ONE TOOL TO MANIPULATE WAKE UP TIME AN CIRCADEAN RHYTHM AND METABOLISM IT IS THE EFFECTOR IT IS THE WAY THAT THE CENTRAL CIRCADEAN CLOCK IMPACKS ALL THE CELLS AND TISSUES OF YOUR BODY IF YOU WANT TO READ FURTHER ABOUT THIS AND YOURE REALLY CURIOUS ABOUT THE ROLL OF TEMPERATURE WORK BY JO TAKAHASHI WHO USE TO BE AT NORTH WESTERN UNIVERSITY AAND IS NOW AT YOU TEE SOUTH WESTERN AND DALIS A INCREDIBLE A SCIENTIST AND IS IT REALLY WORKED OUT A LOT OF THE MECHANISMS AROUND TEMPERATURE AND CIRCADEAN RHYTHMS YOU CAN JUST GOOL HIS NAME YOU'LL SEE A A WHOLE BUNCH OF STUDIES THERE I WANT TO TALK ABOUT COLD AND COLD EXPOSURE BECAUSE THERE'S A GREAT MISCONCEPTION ABOUT THIS THAT ACTUALLY YOU CAN LEVERAGE ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE COL TO EITHER INCREASE THERMOGENISIS AND FAT LOSS METABOLISM OR YOU CAN USE IT FOR STRESS MITIGATION AND MOOD AND IT REALLY DEPENDS ON ONE SIMPLE FEATURE OF HOW YOU APPROACH THE ICE BATH AR COLD SHOWER IF YOU GET INTO AN ICE BATH OR COLD SHOWER AND YOU ARE CALMING YOURSELF YOU'R ACTIVELY CALMING THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM MAY BE THROUGH SOME DEEP BREATHING MAY B Y THROUGH VISUALIZATION MAY BESING A SONG IN A PEOPLE DO THIS STUFF N THEY USE VARIOUS TOOLS SOME PEOPLE FIND PAYING ATTENTION TO AN EXTERNAL STIMULUS IS MORE HELPFUL YOU'LL THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING NOT THEY EXPERIENCE OF THE COLD OTHER PEOPLE FIND THAT DIRECTLY EXPERIENCING THE COLD AND ITS MOST INTENSE FORMING KIND OF GOING INTO THE COLD QUOTE AND QUOTE A IS THE BEST WAY TO APPROACH IT IT REALLY VARIES FOR FOR PEOPLE THERE IS NO RIGHT OR WRONG WAY TO GO ABOUT THIS BUT THE GOAL OF USING COLD EXPOSURE FOR STRESS ANNOCULATION AND TO RAISE YOUR STRESS THRESHOLD TO BE ABLE TO TOLERATE HEIGHTEN LEVELS OF REAL LIFE STRESS NOT THE ICE BATH BUT REALIZE STRESS LIKE WORK STRESS AND RELATIONAL STRESS ET CETERA IS BY SUPPRESSING THE ACTIVATION OF THE SOCAL SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM MEANING THE ALERTNESS OR STRESS SYSTEM THAT INVOLVES BUFFERING OR TRYING TO RESIST THE SHIVER RESPONSE THE SHIVER RESPONSE IS ANAUTONOMIC RESPONSE DESIGNED TO GENERATE HEAT PRESUMABLY IN ACTUALLY THAT IS WHAT IT DOES IN ORDER TO COUNTER THE COLD SO WHEN YOU USE COLD EXPOSURE AND YOUR ON A MUSCLING THROUGH IT OR YOUR LEARNING TO RELAX WITHIN IT AS A FORM OF STRESS ANOCULATION THAT'S GREAT AND WORKS QUITE WELL FOR THAT PURPOSE AND THEREIS A REASON WHY COLD EXPOSURE IS USED IN A VARIETY OF FORMS OF MILITARY STRESS INOCULATION MOST FAMOUS OF WHICH OF COURSEIS THE NAVY SEAL BOODS OSTRA TEST REALLY WHICH IS SCREENING PROCEDURE FOR BECOMING SEAL VOLVES A LOT OF EXPOSURE TO COLD WATER HOWEVER IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN USING COLD EXPOSURE FOR FAT LOSS AND THERMAGENESIS YOU WANT TO DO THE EXACT OPPOSITE THING THERE WAS A PAPER PUBLISHED IN NATURE TO YEARS AGO WHICH SHOWED THAT COLD INDUCED SHIVER THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL SHIVER ACTIVATES THE RELEASE OF A CHEMICAL IN THE BODY FROM MUSCLE CALLED SUCINATE ES U C C ION AT E SUCINATE TRAVELS IN THE BLOOD STREAM AND THEN GOES IN ACTIVATES A PARTICULAR CATEGORY OF FAT NOT THE TYPICAL KIND OF PINK OR WHITE FAT THAT WE THINK OF IS LIKE BLUBBER IN HUMANS THE H STUFF THAT PEOPLE SEEM TO GENERALLY WANT LESS OF EXCEPT FOR THOSE GENETIC FREAKS THAT SEEM TO HAVE NONE OF IT DEVENDING WHAT THEY CONSUME CONGRATULATIONS BROWN FAT IS COLD BROWN FAT EXXACTUALLY DARK UNDER THE MICROSCOPE IT IT'S RICH WITH MITOCONDRIA AND IT EXISTS MOSTLY BETWEEN THE SCAPULAIAND IN THE UPPER NECK AND IT GENERALTES GENERATES THERMAGENESS AND HEAT IN THE BODY IT'S RICH WITH A CERTAIN CATEGORY OF ADRENERGIC RECEPTER INCENILY APINEFERON BINDS TO ATRONERGIC RECEPTORS THESE BROWN FAT SELLS INCREASE METABOLISM IT'S CALLED BROWN FAT THERMAGENESIS AND CAUSE FAT BURNING BURNING OF OTHER KINDS OF FAT THE PINK AND WHITE FAT SWHAT DOES THIS SALL MEAN THIS MEANS IF YOU WANT A USE THE ICE BATH IN ORDER INCREASE METABOLISM SHIVER AWAY IF YOU WANT TO USE THE ICE BATH OR COLD SHOWER IN ORDER TO STRESS ANOCULATE RESIST THE SHIVER AND LEARN TO STAY CALM OR QUOTNQUOTE MUSCLE THROUGH IT NOW I DON'T KNOW THAT ANY ONE'S EVER RALLY TALKED ABOUT THIS PUBLICLY O A BECAUSE I THINK THE DATE ARE SO NEW AND I THINK THAT PEOPLE ASSUME THAT THE ICE BATH OR COLD EXPOSURE IS JUST ONE THING HERE IAVE TALKED ABOUT IT THREE WAYS TO SHIFT YOUR CIRCATIAN RHYTHM DEPENDING ON WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE DOING IT EARLY IN THE DAY WHILE YOUR TEMPERATURE IS STILL RISING OR AT ITS PEAK OR AFTER THAT PEAK IN ORDER TO EXTEND THE PERCEPTION OF YOUR DAY AS CONTINUING AND MAKE YOU WANT TO GO TO SLEEP LATER AND WAKE UP LATER NOW AND THEN THE THIRD WAY OF COURSE IS TO EITHER ACTIVATE BROWN FAT THERMAGENESIS AND INCREASE METABOLISM I SUPPOSE THE FOURTH WAY WOULD BE TO A INCREASE STREST TOLERANCE OR STREST THRESHOLD BUT REMEMBER TEMPERATURE IS THE EFFECTOR OF CIRCATAN RHYTHMS LIGHT IS THE TRIGGER THE SUPERCISEMATIC NUCLEUS IS THE MASTER CIRCLEADIAN CLOCK THAT MEDIATES ALL THESE CHANGES ALSO INFLUENCE BY NONPHOTIC INFLUENCE LIKE EXERCISE AND FEEDING AND THINGS THAT SORT BUT TEMPERATURE IS THE EFFECTOR NOW YOU CAN ALSO SHIFT YOUR CIRCATIAN RHYTHM WITH EATING WHEN YOU TRAVEL AND YOU LAND IN A NEW LOCATION IN YOUR SCHEDULE IS INVERTED TWELVE HOURS ONE WAY THAT WE KNOW YOU CAN SHIFT YOUR RHYTHM MORE QUICKLY IS TO GET ON TO THE LOCAL MEAL SCHEDURAL NOW THAT PROBABLY HAS TO DO IT TWO EFFECTS WANEOR CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE INDUCEWET EATING INDUCED INA INCREASES IN BODY TEMPERATURE NOW YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND WHY THAT WOULD WORK AS WELL AS EATING HAS ITS ANTICIPATORY SECRETION OF BATE OF HYBROCRETENERECTSON THAT I TALKED ABOUT IT EARLIER SO IF THIS IS GETTIN A LITT YOU DOWN IN THE WEEDS DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT WE I WILL GET MORE INTO THIS IN EPISODE FOR OF HOW TO SHIFT ONE'S RHYTHM BUT I WOULD LOVE FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTIND THAT LIGHT AND TEMPERATURE ARE THE REAL HEAVY DUTY LEVERS WHEN IT COMES TO MOVING YOUR CIRCATIAN RHYTHM AND SLEEP TIMES AN ACTIVITY SCHEDULS AND EXERCISE IN FEEDING CAN HELP BUT REALLY TEMPERATURE AND LIGHT WITH LIGHT BEING THE PRIMARY ONE OR THE MOST IMPORTANT WHEN IT COMES TO SLEEP AND WAKEFULNESS MANY PEOPLE ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT FOOD AND NERRO TRANSMITTERS AND HALLOWS RELATE TO SLEEP WAKEFULNESS AND MOOD WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY TWENTY FIVE HOURS OF CONTENT FOR ME TO COVER BUT I AM IN A TRYING TO STILL OUT THE MOST COMMON QUESTIONS WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT NERMODULATORS LIKE TOPO ME TO SEETOCOLLING IN NOR UP IN EFFERON YOU MAY NOTICE IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS THAT THE PRECURSERS TO SAY CERATONAN IS TRIP TO FAN TRIP TO FANACHALY COMES FROM THE DIET IT COMES FROM THE FOODS THAT WE EAT TYROCENE IS THE PRECURSIR TO DOPOMIE IT COMES FROM THE FOODS THAT WE EAT AND THEN ONCE WE INJEST THEM THET THOSE COMPOUNDS ARE CIRCULATE TO A VARIETY A DIFFERENT CELLS AN TISSU UES BUT IT IS TRUE THAT ARE FOOD AN THE PARTICULAR FOODS WE CAN INFLUENCE THINGS LIKE NERAMODULATOR LEVELS TO SOME EXTENT IT'S NOT THE ONLY WAY BECAUSE THERE RE ALSO ENZIMES AND BOU CHEMICAL PATHWAYS THAT ARE GOING TO REGULATE HOW MUCH TYRASINE GETS CONVERT INTO DOPAMINE AND THERE ARE ELEMENTS OF THE DOPAMAN URGIC NORONS THE DOPEME NERONS THEMSELVES THAT ARE ELECTRICAL THAT HAVE INFLUENCE ON THIS AS WELL BUT THERE ARE COUPLE FAIR ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE CAN MAKE FIRST OF ALL NUTS AND MEATS IN PARTIULAR RED MEATS TEN TO BE RICH IN THINGS LIKE TYROCINE RI THAT TELLS YOU RIHT THERE THAT BECAUSE TYRISINE IS THE PRECURSERVE DOPAMINE AND DOPAMEN IS THE PRECURSEROF NOR UP ANEFERON AN EPINEFERON THAT THOSE FOODS TEND TO LEND THEMSELVES TOWARD THE PRODUCTION OF DOPAMINE AND EPINEFERAND AND THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH WAKEFULNESS NOW OF COURSE THE VOLUME OF FOOD THAT WE EAT ALSO INPACKS ARE WATEFULNESS IF WE EAT A LOT OF ANYTHING WHETHER NOT IT'S RIBITAKES RICE WERE CARDBOARD PLEASE DON'T EAT CARDBOARD YOURE STOMACH OF ITS VERY DISTENDED WILL DRAW LOT OF BLOOD INTO YOUR GOT AND YOU WILL DIVERT BLOOD FROM OTHER TISSUES AND YOU'LL BECOME SLEEPY SO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT FOOD CONTENT IT'S ALSO ABOUT FOOD VOLUME I FASTING STATES GENERALLY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH MORE ALERTNESS EPINEFERAN SO FORTH AND FED STATES ARE GENERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH MORE QUIESCENCE IN RELAXATION SERATONAN AND AND THE KIND OF THINGS THAT LEND THEMSELVES MORE TOWARDS SLEEP AND LESS TOWARD ALERTNESS FOODS THAT ARE RICH IN TRIP TO FAN TEN TO BE THINGS LIKE WHITE MEAT TURKEY ALSO COMPLEX CARBOHYDRATES SO IF YOU LIKE YOU CAN START EXPERIMENTING DEPENDING ON WHAT FOODS YOU EAT YOU CAN START EXPERIMENTING WITH CARBORHYDRATE RICH MEALS FOR ACCESSING SLEEP AND MORE DEPTH OF SLEEP THIS IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING I PERSONALLY DO I TEND TO EAT PRETTY LOW CARBISH DURING THE DAY I ASHY FAST FOR UNTIL ABOUT NOON NOT BECAUSE I HAVE TO WORK TO DO THAT BUT BECAUSE I'D RATHER JUST DRINK CAFINE AND WATER DURING THAT TIME AND THEN SOMETIME AROUND NOON I CAN'T TAKE IT ANY MORE AND I'M HUNGRY AND I EAT AND I TRY IN O EAT LOW CARB ISH UNLESS I'VE WORKED OUT EXTREMELY HARD IN THE PREVIOUS TWO HOURS WHICH I RARELY DO ALTHOUGH I DO SOMETIMES AND THAT MEAL IS THEN DESIGNED TO PROLONG MY PERIOD OF WAKEFULNESS INTO THE LATE AFTERNOON AND THEN SOMETIME AROUND DINNER TIME WHICH FOR ME IS ROUND SIX THIRTY SEVEN P M EIGHT P M SOMETIMES LAYS NINE P M I TEND TO EAT THINGS LIKE WHITE MEAT FISH POSDAS RICE THAT KIND OF THING UM MY FAVORITE FOOD OF ALL FOR ACCESSING TRIP TO FAN IS ACTUALLY A STARCH IT'S A IT SUCHLY A VEGETABLE THAT'S THE CRASSANT WHICH IS MY FAVORITE VEGETABLE I DON'T NEAT THOSE ALL THE TIME BUT I I LOVE THEM AND THEY SEEM TO INCREASE DOPAMINES WELL A NEVER AHLY DONE THE MASPECTOMATRY ON A CROSAN BUT ID THEY DEFILY INCREUSE TRIP TOFAN AND RELAXATION FOR ME IN ALL SERIOUSNESS LO CARBORHYDRATE SLASH FASTED SLASH KEETOGENIC DIETS TEN TO LEND THEMSELVES TOWARDS WAKEFULNESS BY WAY OF INCREASING EPANEFERAN NOR UPAN EFFERAN A DRENNAL AND DOPE MEN AN THINGS OF THAT SORT CARBORAHYDRATE RICH MEALS AND I SUPPOSE WE STOCK BOUT MEALS AS SUPPOSED TO DIET TEND TO LEND THEMSELVES MORE TOWARD TRIP TO FAN SCERATONAN AND MORE LETHARGIC STATES THERE IS VERY LIMITED EVIDENCE THAT I AM AWARE OF THAT CARBOHYDRATE SHOULD EAT AND AT ONE TIME A DAY IN AS IT RELATES TO A METABOLISM ET CETERA I'M SURE THAT WILL OPEN UP A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DEBATE AH IF YOU WORK OUT VERY HARD IN YOU TO PLEAT LIKAGIN THAN THIS ALL CHANGES SO SOME PEOPLE ARE WORKING OUT VERY HARD IN TO PLEADING LIKAGAN OTHER PEOPLE OR NOT THAT GETS AWAY OUTSIDE THE CONTECT OF THIS PARTICULAR PODCAST BUT YES INDEED DIFFERENT FOODS CAN BIUS DIFFERENT NORMODULATORS AND THEREBY CAN MODULATE ARE WAKING OR ARE FEELINGS OF LETHARGY AND SLEEPINESS THERE ARE COUPLE EFFECTS OF FOOD THAT ARE INDEPENDENT RASHES AT COUPLE EFFECTS OF EATING CAUSE THE FOOD WON'T DO IT WHEN IT'S SITTING ACROSS THE TABLE BUT OF EATING THAT ARE POWERFUL FOR MODULATING CIRCATIAN RHYTHM WAKEFULNESS ET CETERA AND THAT'S BECAUSE EVERY TIME WE EAT WE GET EATING INDUCE THORMAGENESISTS REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE EAT NOW THET EATING INDUCE THERMAGENESIS AND INCREASIN METABOLISM WHICH IS AN INCREASE IN TEMPERATURE REALLY IS PROBABLY GREATEST FOR A MENOACID RICH FOODS LIKE MEATS BUT ALSO OTHER TYPES OF FOODS IT'S A MINIMAL INCREASE AND BODY TEMPERATURE COMPARED TO SAY COLD EXPOSURE ORE EXERCISE NOW WHETHER NOT SAI QUARTER OF A DEGREE OR HALF A DEGREE OR DEGREE IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE INDIVIDUAL AND OF COURSE THERE ARE BLOOD SUGAR EFFECTS THERE ARE THINGS LIKE WHETHER NOT YOU ARE TYPE WONE OR TYPE TO DIABETIC WHETHER NOT YOUR INSOLENT RESISTIN WHETHER NOT LIKE THERE'S A A A KID WHO A IN TURNS ON THE PODCAST HERE WHOSE A SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD AND I'M CONVINCE THAT HE CAN EAT ANYTHING AND HE JUST SEEMS TO LIKE BURN AT OP HES GROWING AT EVERY TIME ESHLY THE OTHER DAY HE WALKED INTO THE OTHER ROOM IN TWO DAYS LATER HE WALKED OUT OF THE SAME ROOM E CAME OUT IN BETWEEN OF COURSE BUT AND IANS LIKE YOUR YE GREW EWAS AT YOU KNOW BUT HE'S AT THAT STAGE WHERE HE JUST GROWING FOOD AS GOIN AFFECT A TEA NATURE VERY DIFFERENTLY THAN S CAN AFFECT A FULL GROWN PERSON SO IN GENERAL STARCHY CARBOAHYDRATES WHITE MEATS SUCH AS TURKEY SOME FISH INCREASE TRIP TO FAN THEREFORE CERATONAN THEREFORE MORE LETHARGIC STATES MORE CALM MEAT NUTS AND THERE ARE PROBABLY SOME PLANT BASE FOODS THAT I'M NOT AWARE OF AN I APOLOGIZE I SHOULD READ UP ON THIS THAT ALSO HIGH ENTYRASENE THAT CAN INCREASE THINGS LIKE DOPE ME NOR UPAN EFFERAN EPAN EFERAN ALERTNESS SO YOU CAN VARY THESE HOWEVER YOU LIKE MOST PEOPLE I THINK ARE EATING A VARIETY OF THESE THINGS IN IN IN GIVEN MEAL AND THERE ARE OTHER PARAMETERS OF NUTRITION THT ARE IMPORTANT TOO VOLUME OF FOOD FOR THE REASONS I MENTION BEFORE THE VOLUME OF FOOD IN THE GUT LESS FOOD IN THE GUT WHETHER OT'S EMPTY OR SMALL AMOUNT OF FOOD WILL CHTEND TO CORRELATE WITH WAKEFULNESS LARGE VOLUMES OF FOOD OF ANY KIND WE'LL TEND TO CORRELATE AND DRIVE THE CALMING RESPONSE AND THAT'S BY WAY OF THIS NERVE PATHWAY CALLD THE VAGATS WE HACT TOU HAVE SENSE RY FIBERS IN THE GUT THAT COMMUNICATE TO LITTLE PROTRUSION OF NURONS THAT S AT RECTNICXS THE JUGGLER CALLED THE NODOSE GANGLIA AND O D O S E ON MIGHT COSTELLO IT'S NODOSE RIGHT NOW HE'S ALL DOZE NODO'S ACTUALLY MEANS HAVING MANY PROTRUSIONS AND ITS ACCOUNT OF A LUMPY COLLECTION OF NURONS A GANGLEAS JUST COLLECTION NARNS AND THEN IT GOES INTO THE BRAINSTEM AND THEN FORWARD IN THE BRAIN TO THE AREAS OFTHE BRAIN THEY'RE INVOLVED IN PRODUCTION OF VARIOUS NORMOTULATORS SO WHAT WE EAT AND THE VOLUME OF FOOD ARE BOTH SIGNALING TO THE BRAIN IT'S NOT JUST ONE OR THE OTHER AND THEN THERE'S ALSO THIS EATING IN DUCE THEIR MAGENESIS AND NOW YOU KNOW FROM THE DISCUSSION ABOUT TEMPERATURE THAT IF YOU'RE EATING EARLI IN THE DAY YOURE TENDING TO SHIFT YOUR RHYTHM EARLIER SO HT YOU'LL WANT TO WAKE UP EARLIER THE NEXT DAY IF YOU'RE EATING VERY LATE IN THE DAY EVEN IF YOU CAN FALL ASLEEP AFTER THAT THERE'S A TENDENCY FOR YOU TO WANT A SLEEP LATER THE NEXT DAY NOW THIS OF COURSE IS ALL GOING TO BE CONSTRAINED ABY WHEN YOUR KIDS NEED TO EAT WHEN YOUR SPOUSE NEEDS TO EAT WHEN YOUR FRIENDS NEED TO EAT OR IF YOU LIVE ALONE OR WHAT OTHER THINGS YOU'RE DOING IF YOU'RE LIKE ME AND YOU KIND O DON'T EAT UNTIL NOON THEN EAT SOME TIME AROUND NOON AND THEN I'M TERRIBLE ABOUT MEALS I JUST START EATING THE INGREDIENTS WHILE MSPOSE TO BE COOKING AND THEN EVENTUALLY THEY'RE ALL GONE AND I UESS THAT'S OF MEAL IT VARIES SOME PEOPLE ARE NARODICALLY ATTACHED TO A PARTICULAR MEAL SCADUL SOMEPEOPLE ARE NOT I TAKE MY LIGHT EXPOSURE SCATTUL FAR MORE SERIOUSLY THAN I TAKE MY MEAL SCHEDUL ALTHOUGH IN GENERAL A CHINEE HEALTHY FOODS FOR THE MOST PART CRISONS INCLUDED I WAS ASKED SEVERAL TIMES WHETHER NOT MEN AND WOMEN ARE MALES AND FEMALES DIFFER IN TERMS OF THESE NARRO TRANSMIT OR FENATYPES AND THE RHYTHMS OF SLEEP AND TEMPERATURE YOU KNOW WE COULD PROBABLY DEVOTE A WHOLE MONTH D WE PRY WI'LL DEVOTED ENTIRE MONTH TO WHAT ARE CALLED SEX DIFFERENCES BECAUSE THOSE TEND TO BE RELATED TO THINGS WE ABSOLUTELY KNOW LIKE EXACTS IR EX WHY CROMAZONES ARE EX WHY WHI AND SOME CASES ARE DOUBLE EX CROMAZOES OM AS POS TO GENDER SEXON AND CARRIO TYPE AS WE CALL IT GENETIC MAKE UP IS IS CRYSTAL CLEAR THERE ARE ARE THINGS THAT CORRELATE WITH ONE OR THE OTHER BUT IT'S COMPLICATED AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN EXPLORED IN WHAT I THINK IS ENOUGH DETAIL ACTUALLY IN RECENTLY I I GUESS IT WAS ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO THE NATUONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH MADE IT A MAN DATE THAT ALL STUDIES USE SEXES A BIOLOGICAL VARIABLE AND ACTUALLY EXPLORE BOTH SEXES OF MICE BOTH SEXES OF HUMANS WHEN DOING ANY KIND OF STUDY BECAUSE THERE WAS A BI AS TOWARDS ONLY USING MAL ANIMALS OR MAIL SUBJECTS PRIOR TO THAT TIME SO A LOT OF DAT ARE NOW COMING OU REVEALING IMPORTANT SEX DIFFERENCES THAT I THINK OA'RE GOING TO HAVE POWERFUL IMPACT ON HEALTH PRACTICES ET CETERA RESPONSE TO DRUGS RESPONSE TO DIFFERENT SLEEP SCHEDULES ET CETERA I' PERHAPS THE THE MOST SAILING AND OBVIOUS ONE IS THAT DURING PREGNANCY UM FEMALES EXPERIENCE A A WHOLE RANGE OF ENDEGRIN AND NURRO A EFFECTS AND WE DEFINITE WE'LL DEVOTE A MONTH TO PREGNANCY AN CHILD BIRTH AND CHILD REARING UM AND FOR THAT I'D REALY LIKE TO BRING IN SOME EXPERTS I'VE GOT TERRIFIC COLLEAGUES AT STAMFORD AND ELSEWHERE THAT WORK ON THESE THINGS S THAT WE CAN GO INTO THOSE IN MORE DEPTH SO I'M NOT AM BLOWING OFF THOSE QUESTIONS I'M JUST I'M CON O PUSHING THEM DOWN THE ROAD A LITTLE BIT WERE I CAN GIVE YOU A MORE A THOROUGH ANSWER SO AS WE FINISH UP I JUST WANT TO OFFER YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO AN EXPERIMENT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF VARIABLES THAT CAN IMPACTS SLEEP IN WAKEFULNESS AND IN KEEPING WITH THE THEME OF THE POD CASTS WE ARE GOING TO CONTEENU TO TALK ABOUT SLEEP N WAKEFULNESS AND TOOLS FOR THOSE AND THE SCIENCE BEHIND THOSE TOOLS AS WE GO FORWARD BUT THERE ARE REALLY JUST FOUR SIMPLE PERAMETERS THAT YOU HAVE CONTROL OVER THAT YOU CAN IMMEDIATELY START TO RECORD AND TAKE NOTE OF JUST TO SEE HOW YOU'RE DOING WITH THESE THINGS WITH NO JUDGMENT ARN PERHAPS NO CHANGE TO WHAT YOURE ACTUALLY DOING IT MIGHT BE INTERESTING JUST A SUGGESTION TO WRIGHT DOWN FOR EACH DAY WHEN YOU WENT OUTSIDE TO GET SUNLIGHT AND WHEN YOU DID THAT RELATIVE TO WAKING SO YOU WOULD WRITE DOWN I THE WAY I DO THI SO MY CALENDER S I'LL WRIGHT DOWN THAT I DON'T GET EXACT ABOUT I MIGHT SAY N I WOKE UP AT YOU KNOW SIX FIFTEEN AND THEN I AS I'LL PUT A U SIX FIFTEEN AND THEN M S LL FOR SUNLIGHT OW YOU SOMETIMES GET OUTSIDE RIGHT AWAY OTHER TIMES I'M LESS GOOD AT THAT AND I'LL GO OUT AROUND OUN O SAY SEVEN AND FOR HOW LONG I MAYBE LIKE TEN FIFTEEN MINUTES OR SO AND THEN I'LL PUT A LITTLE CHECK AT ROUGHLY THE TIMES A THAT I ATE MY A SO CALLED MEALS OR THOSE I MENTION SOMTS MY MEALS ARE A BUNCH OF SMALL CHECKS THAT JUST KIND OF EXTEND THROUGH THE LATE HOURS OF THE DAY YOURS MIGHT BE MORE UM CONFINED TO TO CERTAIN TIMES AND THEN YOU MIGHT JUST TAKE NOTE OF WHEN YOU EXERCISED JUST PUT DOWN A E FOR WHEN YOU EXERCISE WAIT TRAINING OR EROBIC EXERCISE AND YOU MIGHT NOTE WHEN YOU MIGHT HAVE FELT CHILLED OR COLD IF YOU DO OR YOU MIGHT HAVE FELT PARTICULARLY HOT OR IF YOU WOKE UP IN THEMILL NIGHT WHEN YOU FELT PARTICULARLY HOT AND THEN THE LAST THING YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO IS JUST RIGHT DOWN IF IN WHEN YOU DID A N ON SLEEP DEEP RESTPROTOCALL AND AS TE OUR PROTO CALL THAT COULD BE MEDITATION THAT COULD BE YOCANIDRA THAT COULD BE HYPNOSIS ANYTHING THAT YOURE USING TO DELIBERATELY TEACH YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM HOW TO GO FROM MORE ALERTNESS TO MORE CALMNESS IN THE WAKING STATE EVEN OF ITS WAKING UP INTHE MILL THE NIGHT IN DOING AN AS TE OUR PROTOCALL OR IN THE AFTERNOON OR FIRST THING IN THE MORNING TO RE COVER SOME SLEEP AND ABILITY TO PER FORM DEEPIOS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE LOST FROM A MINIMAL OR POOR NIGHT'S SLEEP SO YOU'REGOIG TO RIGHT DOWN WHEN YOU WOKE UP WHEN YOU VIEU SUNLIGHT THAT MIGHT BE IN THE MORNING IN THE EVENING ARE JUST A THE MORNING HOOFLEETS THE MORNING AND THE EVENING WHEN YOU EXERCISED WHEN YOU EATE YOUR MEALS AND USING A SIMPLE RECORD KEEPING SCHEME LIKE DB YOU FOR WAKING HESELL FOR SUNLIGHT MAYBE YOU COME UP WITH A SYSTEM WHERE IT'S A CHECK OR AN EX OR SOMETHING FOR EXERCISE THIS IS NOT DESIGN TO MAKE YOU NAURODICALLY ATTACHED TO ONM TRACKING ALL YOUR YOUR BEHAVIORS AND EVERYTHING YOU DO OM I FORINCASE DON'T TRACK WHAT I EAT IN PARTICULAR I CAN I KNOW WHAT WHAT WORKS FOR ME AND I JUST TRYIND STAY WITHIN ON WITHIN THAT RANGE BUT BY DOING THIS YOU CONSTART TO REVEAL SOME REALLY INTERESTING PATTERNS PATTERNS THAT NO ANSWER THAT I COULD PROVIDE YOU ABOUT ANY EXISTING TOOL OR PROTOCALL COULD YOU KNOW COUNTER IIT'S REALLY ABOUT TAKING THE PATTERNS OF BEHAVIORS OF WAKING AND LIGHT VIEWING AND EATING AND EXERCISE AND SUPERIMPOSING THAT ON WHAT YOUR LEARNING IN THIS PODCAST AND ELSEWHERE OF COURSE AND WHAT YOU ALREADY KNOW AND TRYING TO SEE WHERE CERTAIN PROBLEM OR PROBLEMS OR PAIN POINTS MIGHT BE ARISING MAYBE YOU'R EATING REALLY LATE IN THE DAY AND YOUR WAKING UP IN MILL THE IGHT REALLY WARM WELL NOW YOU WOULD SAY WELL THAT COULD BE DOE TO KIND OF AN INCREASE IN TEMPERATURE THAT IS EXTENDING MY DAY O OR MAYBE YOU START TO FIND THAT USING COLD EXPOSURE EARLY IN THE DAY AS GREAT FOR YOU BUT USING AT LATE IF IT'S TOO LATE IN THE DAY THAT'S NOT GREAT OR OM IF YOUARE INTO THE SANARS EVEN LIKE SOME PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF IF I TAKE A HOT SHOWERS IN A HOT TUBBER SANA LATE AT NIGHT WELL THEN I GET A COMPENSITORY DECREASE IN BODY TEMPERATURE AND I SLEEP GREAT PROVIDED A HYDRATE WELL ENOUGH CAUSE THAT CAN BE COND OF A DBE HYDRATING THING TO SIT IN HOT A HOT CONDITIONS BUT IF I DO THE SANA EARLY IN THE DAY UNLESS I EXERCISE IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARD THEN I TEND TO GET THE TEMPERATURE DROP WHICH MAKE SENSE BECAUSE WE GET THESANA YOUR GET VAZODISOLATION YOU DRAWFUL LOT O HEAT N THAN YOU GENERALLY GET A COMPENSITORY DROP IN TEMPERATURE IF YOU DO THAT EARLY IN THE DAY THAT'S RIGHT ABOUT THE TIME THAT THAT TEMPERATURE IS TRYING TO IN TRAIN THE CIRCATING CLOCKS OF YOUR BODY THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS TO ME OTHER PEOPLE IT MIGHT BE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT AND SOME PEOPLE HAVE MORE RESILIENT SYSTEMS THAN OTHERS SO I JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO START BECOMING SCIENTISTS OF YOUR OWN PHYSIOLOGY OF

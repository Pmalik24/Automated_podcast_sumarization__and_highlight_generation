WELCOME TO THE HUBERMANLATPONCANS NE AS SCIENCE  SCIENCE TAE TON FRI  BY MAY DRUHUBERMEN AND OM OUR PROFESSOR OF NEUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICIN MY GUEST TO DAY IS DOCTOR ROBERT LUSTIC DOCTOR ROBERT LUSTIG IS AN ENDERCHONOLOGISTS THAT IS HE'S A SPECIALIST IN THE FUNCTION OF HORMONES IN THE BODY ND A PROFESSOR OF PEDIATRIC ENTER CHRONOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSHY OF CALIFORNIA SANFRANCISCO HE IS OUTHORED MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED PEREVIEWED STUDIES EXPLORING HOW DIFFERENT TYPES OF NUTRIENTS THAT IS FOOD IMPACT OUR CELLER FUNCTIONING OUR ORGAN FUNCTIONING AND THEREBY OUR HEALTH DURING TO DAY'S DISCUSSION WE DISCUSS THE IDEA OF WHETHER NOT A CALORY IS INDEED A CALORY AND WHETHER NOT OUR BODY WEIGHT AND BODY COMPOSITION ONLY REFLECTS THE NUMBER OF CALORIES WE EAT VERSES THE CALORIES THAT WE BURN WE TALK ABOUT HOW DIFFERENT FOOD TYPES THAT IS HOW THE DIFFERENT MACRONEUTRIANTS PROCING FAT AND CARBOHYDRATES ARE PROCESSED IN THE BODY AND THE IMPORTANT ROLL THAT FIBR AND THE GOP MICROBIOM PLAYS IN THAT PROCESS AND WE PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE TOPIC OF HOW DIFFERENT TYPES OF SUGARS AND FROOK TOST IN PARTICULAR CAN INDEED BE ADDICTIVE TO THE BRAIN AND CAN MODIFY THE WAY THAT HORMONS IN THE BODY IN PARTICULAR INSOLENT INPACT OUR LIVER HEALTH KIDNEY HEALTH AND INDEED THE HEALTH OF ALL OF OUR CELLS AND ORGANE INDEED DOCTOR LUSTIG IS AN EXPERT IN HOW SUGAR IMPACTS THE BRAIN AND BODY WE TALK ABOUT HOW CERTAIN TYPES OF SUGARS CAN INDEED BE ADDICTIVE IN THE SAME WAY THAT CERTAIN DRUGS OF ABUSE AND BEHAVIORS CAN BECOME ADDICTIVE SO IN OTHER WORDS HOW SUGAR ACTUALLY CHANGES THE WAY THAT THE BRAIN WORKS AND WE DISCUSS HOW THE FOOD INDUSTRY THAT IS THE COMMODIIZATION AND SALE OF PARTICULAR TYPES OF FOOD HAS ALTERED THE WAY THAT WE EAT AND INDEED THE FOODS THAT WE CRAVE TO DAY'S DISCUSSION COVERS ALL OF THAT AND BY THE END OF TODAY'S DISCUSSION YOU'LL HAVE A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF HOW FOODS ARE PROCESSED WHEN THEY ENTER YOUR BODY AND HOW THOSE DIFFERENT FOOD CHOICES ARE IMPACTING OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM HEALTH BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING IN RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTIC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS EIGHT SLEEP EIGHT SLEEP MAKES SMART MATRESS COVERS WITH COOLING HEATING AND SLEEP TRACKING CAPACITY A SPOKEN MANY TIMES BEFORE IN THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE FACT THAT SLEEP IS THE FOUNDATION OF MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE NOW A KEY COMPONENT OF GETTING A GREAT NIGHTS SLEEP IS THAT IN ORDER TO FALL AND STAY DEEPLY ASLEEP YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE ACTUALLY HAS TO DROP BY ABOUT ONE TO THREE DEGREES AND IN ORDER TO WAKE UP FEELING REFRESHED AND ENERGIZED YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE ACTUALY HAS TO INCREASE BY ABOUT ONE TO THREE DEGREES ONE OF THE BESS WAYS TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE TEMPERATURE CHANGES ACCURR AT THE APPROPRIATE TIMES AT THE BEGINNING AN THROUGHOUT AND AT THE END OF OUR NIGHT WHEN YOU WAKE UP IS TO CONTROL THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR SLEEPING ENBIRONMENT AND THAT'S WHAT EIGHT SLEEP ALLOWS YOU TO DO IT ALL OWS YOU TO PROGRAM THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR MATTRESS AND SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT SUCH THAT YOU FALLEND STAY DEEPLY SLEEP EASILY AND WAKE UP EACH MORNING FEELING INCREDIBLY REFRESHED IN MENERSHISE I'VE BEEN SLEEPING ON AN EIGHT SLEEP MATTRESS COVER FOR ALMOST THREE YEARS NOW AND IT HAS DRAMMATICALLY IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF MY SLEEP SO MUCH SO THAT WHEN I TRAVEL AN I MEN A HOTEL OR AN AERBEAN BEAN I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO MY EIGHT SLEEP I VERY MUCH LOOK FOR TO GETTING HOME BECAUSE MY SLEEP IS ALWAYS BETTER WHEN I SLEEP ON MY EIGHT SLEEP MATTRESS COVER IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY EIGHT SLEEP YOU CAN GO TO EIGHT SLEEP DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMAN TO GET A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS OFF THEIR POD THREE MATTRESS COVER EIGHT SLEEP CURRENTLY SHIPS IN THE U ESSA CANDIDA U

SIMILAR TO A FRENCH PRESS FOR MAKING COFFEE BUT IS IN FACT A MUCH BETTER WAY TO MAKE COFFEE I FIRST LEARNED ABOUT AERO PRESS WELL OVER TEN YEARS AGO AND I'VE BEEN USING ONE EVER SINCES AERO PRESS WAS DEVELOPED BY ALLAN ADLER WHO WAS AN ENGINEER AT STAMFORD AND I KNEW OF ALLAN BECAUSE HE HAD ALSO BUILT THE SO CALLED A ROBY FRISBY WHICH I BELIEVE AT ONE TIME PERHAPS STILL NOW HELD THE GINNIS BOOK OF WORLD'S RECORDS FOR FURTHEST THRONE OBJECT AND I USED TO SEE ALLAN BELIEVE OR NOT AT PARKS SAROUND PALLOALTO TESTING OUT DIFFERENT AROBY FRIBY SO HE WAS SORT OF FAMOUS IN OUR COMMUNITY FOR DEVELOPING THESE DIFFERENT FEETS OF ENGINEERING THAT TURNED INTO COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS NOW I LOVE COFFEE I'M SOMEBODY THAT DRINKS COFFEE NEARLY EVERY DAY USUALLY ABOUT NINETY TO A HUNDRED TWENTY MINUTES AFTER I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING ALTHOUGH NOT ALWAYS SOMETIMES IF I'M GOING TO EXERCISE I'LL DRINK COFFEE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING BUT I LOVE LOVE LOVE COFFEE AND WHAT I'VE PERSONALLY FOUND IS THAT BY USING THE AERO PRESS I CAN MAKE THE BEST POSSIBLE TASTE IN CUP OF COFFEE I DON'T KNOW WHAT EXACTLY IT IS IN THE AERO PRESS THAT ALLOWS THE SAME BEINS TO BE PREPARED INTO A CUP OF COFFEE THAT TASTES THAT MUCH BETTER AS COM MPARED TO ANY OTHER FORM OF BREWING THAT COFFEE EVEN THE TRADITIONAL FRENCH PRESS THE EROPRESS IS EXTREMELY EASY TO USE AND IT'S EXTREMELY COMPACT IN FACT I TAKE IT WITH ME WHENEVER I TRAVEL AND I USE IT ON THE ROAD IN HOTELS EVEN ON PLAINS OR DISSASS FOR SOME HOT WATER AND L BHREW MY COFFEER TEA RIGHT THERE ON THE PLAIN IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY AEROW PRESS YOU CAN GO TO AERO PRESS

JUST BEING HERE BEING INVITED A HIH HONOR RELL APPRECIATEI AND IT'S NOT NOCTORIS JUST RUB C ROB I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR TO THIS CONVERSATION FOR A LONG TIME I'VE SEEN YOUR NOW FAMOUS WE ALSO SAY INFAMOUS BUT FAMOUS UTO VIDIO ABOUT SUGAR WILL PUT A LINK TO IT IN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS IT'S BEEN VIEWED MANY MANY MILLIONS OF TIMES TAN I STILK CAN' FIGURE OT WHY THAT IS YOU KNO WELL I BEG MY MOTHER WOULD WATCH IT AND SHE DIDN'T BUT TWENTY FOUR NAFE MILLION PEOPLE DID WELL I THINK PEOPLE ARE VERY INTERESTED IN WHAT TO EAT WHAT NOT TO EAT AND WILL START OFF SIMPLY TALKING ABOUT WHAT MOST EVERYONE BELIEVES AN UNDERSTANDS WHICH IS THAT A CALORY IS A FORM OF HEAT ENERGY THAT'S GIVEN OFF DURING THE PRCESSING OF SOME FOOD BIT OR SOME THING IF THAT'S MYSTERIOUS TO PEOPLE JUST UNDERSTAND THAT A CALORY IS A UNIT OF ENERGY AND I WAS TAUGHT AND STILL MANY MANY PEOPLE WORLD WIDE BELIEVE THAT A CALORY IS A CALORY MEANING IF I CONSUME MORE CALORIES IN WHATEVER FORM THEN I METABOLIZE BY THINKING FEELING MOVING EXERCISING ET CETERA THEN I WILL GAINWEIGHT AND IF I CONSUME FEWER CALORIES THAN I BURN I WILL LOSE WEIGHT AND WE COULD TALK A LOT ABOUT WHERE THAT WAIGT LOSS COMES FROM DOES IT COME FROM ATIPOSE BODY FAT STORES OR FROM MUSCLE OR FROM PROTINE ER MUSCLE OF COURSE IS PROTINE ET CETERA BUT LET'S START OFF WITH IS A CALORY TRULY A CALORY WHEN IT COMES TO THE PROCESSING OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF CALORIES EVERYONE THINKS THAT OBISITY IS ABOUT ENERGY BALANCE THAT IS CALORIES IN CALORIES OUT THEREFORE TO BEHAVIORS GLUTTONY IN SLOUGTH THEREFORE IF YOURE THAT IT'S YOUR FAULT THEREFORE THAT AN EXERCISE THEREFORE ANY CALORY CAN BE PART OF HA BALANCE TIGHT THEREFORE DON'T PICK ON OUR CALRIES GO PICK ON SOMEBODY ELSE'S CALORIES THIS IS ACTUALLY WHAT THE FOOD INDUSTRY USES TO ASSUAGE THEIR CULPABILITY FOR THE CHANGE IN THE FOOD SUPPLY AND THE RISE IN OBICITY AND CHRONIC DISEASE LIKE DIABETES NOW IT IS TRUE THAT A CALORY IS THAT YUNIT OF ENERGY THAT RAISIS ONE GRAHM OF WATER ONE DEAGREE SENEGRY AND SO THEREFORE A CALORY BURNED IS A CALORY BURNED I DON'T ARGUE THAT THAT'S TRUE THAT'S YOU KNOW THE FIRST LAUTHERMODANAMOCS BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN A CALRY EATEN IS A CALORY EATEN THAT'S NOT THE SAME AND THAT'S WHEREH PEOPLE GET AT ROM SO LET ME GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW THAT CALORY EATEN IS NOT A CALORY EATEN YOU LIKE ALMONS I DO ME TOO AMS ARE GREAT YEAT A HUNDRED AND SIXTY CALORIES AN ALMOS HOW MANY OF THOSE DO ABSORB HUNDRED THIRTY EAT A HUNDRED SIXTY ABSORB A HUNDRED THIRTY WHERE THE OTHER THIRTY GO IN THE PROCESS AND OF THAT FOOD ENERGY NO TURNED OUT THE FIBRE IN THOSE ALMONDS BOTH SOLUBLE AND INSILUBLE FIBR BY THE WAY FIBREES SORT OF THE KEY TOF THE KINGDOM IN THIS STORY FORMS A JELL ON THE NSIDE OF YOUR INTESTIN THE INSILUBLE FIBRE THE SELLULOS FORMS A FISH NET IF YOU WILL A LATTICE WORK ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR DUADNUM THE SOLUBLE FIBRE WHICH ARE GLOBULAR PLUG THE HOLES IN THAT FISH NET TOGETHER THEY FORM A SECONDARY BARRIER CAN ACTUALLY SEE IT ON ELECRON MICROSCO BE A WHITISH JELL AND THAT PREVENTS ABSORPTION OF THOSE THIRTY CALORIES SO YES A HUNDRED THIRTY GET ABSORB BUT MANY OF THEM DON'T THEY END UP GOING FURTHER DOWN THE INTESTIN TO THE NEXT PART CALLD THE JUJUNUM D THA'S WHERE THE MICROBIUMIS NOW EVERY ONE KNOWS ABOUT THE MICROBIUM NOWADAYS YOU KNOW IT'S ALD THE BACTERIA YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS SAY WHEN WOMEN ARE PREGNANT YOU'RE EATING FOR TWO WELL WE'RE ALWAYS EATING FOR A HUNDRED TRILLION NO THEY HAVE TO EAT WHAT ARE THEY EAT THEY EAT WOULD YOU EAT THE QUESTIONS HOW MUCH DULD YOU GET WIRST IS HOW MUCH THEY GET WELL IF YOU AT ALMONDS THEYARE GETTING THOSE THIRTY CALORIES SO EVEN THOUGH YOU COUNT THE CALRIES AT YOUR LIPS THAT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT REALLY MATTERS IS COUNTING THE CALORIES AT YOUR INTESTINAL BRUSHBORDER AND THEY'RE NOT THE SAME SO IF YOU FEED YOUR GUT THATS A GOOD THING BECAUSE THEN YOUR GOT WILL TAKE THOSE CALRIES AND TURN IT INTO THINGS LIKE SHORCHAINED FATIASIS WHICH AND THUP BEING PROTECTIVE AGAINST CHRONIC METABOLIC DISEASE HAT CITATE PROPING A BUTERATE VALRY THOSE ARE ACTUALLY GOOD THEIR ANTI AN FLAMITORY ANTI ALCIMERS BECAUSE YOU FED YOUR MICROBIOM SO EVEN OUGH YOU EIGHT A HUNDRED SIXTY YOU ABSORBED A HUNDRED THIRTY SOL CALORY EATEN S NOT A CALORY EATEN BECAUSE IF YOU ATE IT WITH FIBR IT WASN'T FOR YOU IT WAS FOR YOUR BACTERIA BUT THAT'S NOT THE WAY YOU COUNTO MUP THAT'S PROBEM NUMBER ONE PROB NUMBER TOO  MENO ACIDS SO WE ALL EAT PROTINE LET'S SAY YOU EAT TOO MUCH PROTING YE YOU KNOW THE PORTER HOUSE STAKE  NOW IF YOU'RE BODY BUILDER THOSE MENO ACIDS MIGHT GO TO MUSCLE AND YOU MIGHT INCREASE YOUR MUSCLE MASS BECAUSE YOUR BODY BUILDER BECAUSE YOU'RE PUTTING A EXCESS A FORCE ON THOSE MUSCLES AND YOUR GROWING THOSE MUSCLES OK BUT LET'S SAY YOU'RE NOT A BODY BUILDER LET'S SAY YOURE MERE MORTAL LIKE ME OR LET'S SAY YOU'RE A KID GOING THROUGH PUBERITY TO SYNTHESIZING A LOT OF MUSCLE NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE LIFTING WEIGHTS BECAUSE BUT THERE CAUST TO ASK GRONES MAKING IT HAPPON EABSOLUTELY BUT LET'S SAY YOU'RE NOT LET'S SAY YOU KNOW YOU'RE JUST YOU KNOW TOT SLUMP OFF E THE STREET LIKE TA YOUNJOSHMO AND YOU EAT THAT PORTER HOUSE YOU'VE TAKEN ON ALL THESE AMINOASCES THERE'S NO PLACE TO STOREIT OTHER THAN MUSCLE SO YOURE LIVER TAKES THE EXCESS AND D AMADATES THAT A MENO ACID TAKES THE EMENO GROUP OFF TO TURN IT FROM A MENO ACCID INTO AN ORGANIC ACID AND THEN THAT ORGANIC ACID CAN THEN ENTER THE CREBCYCLE THE TRYCARBIC SILK ACICYCLE WHAT GOES ON IN THE MITACONDRIA IN ORDER TO GENERATE EIGH T P THE CHEMICAL ENERGY THAT YOUR BODY NEEDS IN ORDER TO POWER ITSELF OKE NOW THAT'S A GOOD THING IT TAKES DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY TO PREPARE THAT MENO ACID FOR BURNING AS IT DOES TO PA PREPARE A CARBAL HYDRATE FOR BURNING OR TO THAT FROR CAS ONE ASKE ABOUT WHEN YOU ASKED ABOUT ALMOND WHY THE THE ONE SIXTY VERSES ONE THIRTY I THOUGHT IT WAS THE PROCESS AINTERED OUT IT WAS FIBER YOU'RE SAYING FOR PROTINE LET'S IT LET'S MAKE IT REALISTIC FOR A REALLY NICE BIG PORTER HOUSE STAKE WHICH I LOVE BY THE WAY LET'S SAY LET'S SAY EIGHT HUNDRED GALLORIES WELLET TUN OW HOW MUCH OF THAT IS IS SO THAT'S WHAT GOES IN YOUR MOUTH RIGHT MY MOUTH HOW MUCH OF IT IS ACTUALLY ONM EATEN IN A TO STAY WITH THE YOUR CALORIN IS NOT A CALORIN IN THE PROCESSING OF THAT WHAT PERCENTAGES ACTUALLY GOES INTO YOUR TOTAL COLORIC INTAKE SO ABOUT TEN PER CENT OF EVERYTHING YOU EAT GOES TO JUST MAINTAINING BODY TEMPERATURES CAL THE TERMIC EFFECT OF FOOD BUT WHEN YOU'RE EATING PROTINE YOU ACTUALLY GENERATE MORE HEAT THE REASON IS BECAUSE IT TAKES TOO EIG T P TO FUSS FOR ALATE THAT ORGANIC ACID AS OPPOSE TO ONE EIGH T P TO A FUSS FOR ALATE THAT CARBAL HYDRATE FOR A CONSUMPTION SO YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A NET LOSS OF ENERGY BECAUSE IT WAS A AN MEAN O LASTED VERSES A MONO SACARITE A SUGAR OW YOU YOU BROUGHT UP FAT FAT DOESN'T NEED TO BE FHOSPHOR LATE SO IT ACTUALLY DOESN'T HAVE ANY A THERMIC EFFECT THE FOOD AT THAT POINT SO DEPENDS ON WHAT IT IS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE LOST CAUSE O BUT WIT THISS UM IT'S MAK GET ACTUALLY REALISTIC A SIXTEEN HUNDRED CALORIY A PORTER HOUSE WITH A NICE SLAB OF A ATER GRASSI BUTTER ON THERE I GET TIS EVERY ONCE IND A WHILE NOT NOT YET OFTEN IT BUSIN CREAM SPINACH AND MAYBE SOND MUSHROOMS ALONG THE SIDE OI I WHEN I'M MEATING A PORTER HOSE I DON'T WANT TO ADULTRATE THE TASTE WITH ANYTHING ELSE EX THAT MAY BE SOME SOME BUTTER MAY BE A SALID  AFTERWARDS BUTTBUT LET'S AY SIXTEEN HUNDRED CALORIES OF OF IT'S GOT SOME FAT IN THERE FOR SHORT AN A LET'S SAY UM A THOUSAND OF THOSE CALORIES IS PROTINE AND THE OTHER SIX HUNDRED ARE FAT SON'T LIKE BUTS SOMETHING LIKE THAT TFEN ANT HOW MARBLED IT IS GAS SO BAS TON WHNT YOU JUST SAIT ABOUT THE THERMIC EFFECT OF FOOD AND PROACING IN PARTICULAR OF THAT THOUSAND CALORIES HOW MUCH ACTUALLY IS CAN WE COUNT I'M NOT A CALRY COUNTER BUT DOES ONE INCLUDE AS CALORIES TRULY INJESTED WELL IF YOU INJESTED SIXTEEN HUNDRED B THAT'S A WIT IN THE MOUTH BUT  BUT BUT BUT WHAT IS IS GOING TO GO AGAINST YOUR YOUR A BURN DEFFIS IT RIGHT SO I WOULD HAVE TO ACTUALLY DO THE MATH TO FIGURE THAT OUT BUT L AS A GUEST GET BACK OF THE ENVELOPE BACK THE ENVELOPE CALCULATION YOU GOING TO LOSE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THAT WELL SO E'RE TALKING SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY CALORIES NOWSO FR IT INTO TRANSLATE THIS A BIT SO WE WERE SAYING HERE AS IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO IS TRYING TO LOSE WEIGHT OR MAINTAIN WEIGH OR PERHAPS EVEN GAINWAIG YOU EAT  SIXTEEN HUNDRED CALORY PORTER HOUSE WITH A SLAB OF BUTTER ON IT  SIX HUNDRED THOSE CALRIES WE'RE SAYING IN THIS ITIS IS FAT BUT THE REMAINING THAUSAND CALORIES THAT'S THAT ALL WENT IN YOUR MOUTH SON'T COUNT IT AT YOUR MOUTH RIGHT BUT SEVEN HUNDRED BUT THEN WHEN YOU COMPARED AGAINST YOUR ENERGY BURNE FOR THAT DAY TO MAINTAIN TEMPERATURE BRAIN ACTIVITY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY REALLY IT'S ONLY SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY CALORYE THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE EXACTLY ANOTHER REASON WHY CALOIES NOT A CALORY NOW LET'S TAKE THE THIRD LET'S TAKE FATS SO WER HERE WE HAVE TILL MAKE A THREES HART HEALTHY ANTI INFLAMMATORY ANTI ALSHIMERS SAVE YOUR LIFE AN OVER HERE WE HAVE TRANSFATS THE DEVIL IN CARNETE CONSUMABLE POISON BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BREAK THE TRANS DOUBLE BOND YOU DON'T HAVE THE DESATURATE TO BREAK THAT TRANSDOUBLE BOND SO IT BASICALLY ACCUMULATES LINES YOUR ARTERIES LINES YOUR LIVER CAUSES CLONIC MEDBALC DISEASE CAUSES INSOLENT RESISTANCE WILL MAKE A THREES DON'T EVEN GET BROKEN DOWN FOR ENERGY BECAUSE THEYR' SO IMPORTANT  THEY STAY IN TACT  BECAUSE YOUR BRAIN NEEDS EM YOUR HEART NEEDS AM WHERE'S TRANSFATS AN'T BE BRO AINT DOWN BECAUSE OF THAT TRANSDOUBLE MOMENT ONE SAVE YOUR LIFE OTHER ONE KILL YOU THERE BOTH NINE CALORIES PROGRAM IF YOU EXPLODE HIM IN A BOM CALORIMETER BECAUSE A CALORY BURNED IS A CALORY BURNED BUT A CALORY EATENS NOT A CALORY EATEN BECAUSE ONE WILL SAVE YOUR LIFE ONE 'LL KILL YOU AND FINALLY THE BIG COHOUNA THE ONE THAT BLOWS EVERYTHING ELSE OUT OF THE WATER FRUCTOS IN GLUCOS I NOW GLUCOS IS THE ENERGY OF LIFE SO HEAR ERE TALKING CARBOHYDRATES I THINK MOST OF OUR AUDIENCE WILL BE FAMILIAR WITH THE SO CALE BACK ROM NEU TRANCS WE TALK ABOUT FAT AND THIS CATES OMENS THERE'S SOME MAT FIBRE AN THERE PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT OF CARBOHYDRATE LO NO BET TALKED ABOUT THE PORTER HOUSE WITH BUTTER RIT BCAME HUNGRY ALREADY THAT'S PROACHING IN FACT VERY LITTLE IF ANY CARBOHYDRTE I SHOULD MI ZERO ESSENTIALLY IS A BLERO YERO YET OM AND THEN NOW WRE TIE ABOUT CARBOHYDRATES AND WE'RE GIN TO SUBDIVIDE THAT INTO GLUCOS AND FROCTOS RIGHT GLACTOS PASICALLY BECOMES GLUCOS IN THE LIVER SO WE WE CAN DISPENSE WITH THAT UNLESS YOU HAVE A DISEASE CALL GLECT TO SEEMIA WHICH IS ABOUT ONE IN TWENTY THOUSAND O AND COSES THE ENATAL MEN IN GITISAND YOU KNOW SA DISEASE AS A PEDIATRIC IN THE CHRONOLOGIST I WOULD TAKE CARE OF BUT WE CAN DISPENSE WITH THAT FOR THE MOMENT AT SO GLUCOS FRUCTOS GLUCOS IS THE ENERGY OF LIFE EVERY SELL ON THE PLANET BURNS GLUCOS FOR ENERGY GLUCOS IS SO DAMN IMPORTANT THAT IF YOU DON'T CONSUME IT YOUR BODY MAKES IT SO IT WILL TAKEIN O MENO ACID AND TURN IT INTO GLUCOS THAT'S GLUCO NI YOGENISIS GON YOURGENESIS CETERAT IT WILL TAKE A FATTY ACIT AND TURN IT INTO GLUCOS SPECIFICALLY THE GLUCEROL PORTION OF THE A TRUGGLESRIHT WILL TURN INTO GLUCOS SO THE INNOU IT THEY DN'T HAVE ANY PLACE TO GRO CARBOHYDRATE THAT ICE TE WALE BLUBBER IT STILL US SERM GLUCOS LEVEL THE REASONS BECAUSE YOU HAD TO YOU HAVE TO HAVE US SIRM GLUCOS LEVEL IN ORDER TO POWER YOUR RAIN IN ORDER TO POWER YOUR HEART YES YOUR YOU CAN USE KEYTONES OF COURSE YOU CAN BUT YOU KNOW ONLY IF YOU'RE IN A KEYDOGENTIC STATE WILL YOU USE EXCLUSIVELY KEYTONES AND YOUL ALSO NEED GLUCOS FOR STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN SPECIFIC PROTEINES AND PARTICULARLY HORMONES SO GLUCOS MOLECULES WILL STUD T S H L H FAS AH DIFFERENT PATUITARY HORMONES IN ORDER TO INCREASE THEIR POTENCY IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY AGING LEADS TO DEFECTIVE FORMONOGENESIS FOR INSTANCE HIPOGONAT AS A HIGHBOFIRATISM IS THE LOSS OF GLECCOSCILLATION ON INDIVIDUAL A A A PEPTITE HORMONS BECAUSE OF A THE INABILITY TO ADD GLUCOS BECAUSE THOSE INSTILIN NOINS NO JUST IT'S AN AGENT PHENOMENON AT WILL COME BACK TO THIS CASTIND CAT'S RILLIAN PORTANT THE IDEA THAT INGESTION OF CARBOHYDRATES AND THE AS YOU CALLED IT THE STUDYING OF CARBOHYDRAT MOLECULES ON HORMONS CAN AUGMENT THE FUNCTION OF THOSE HORMNS AND WITH AGING THAT'S A LESSEFFICIENT PROCESS SO TIT SUFFICIENT PROCESS BUT IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF CONSUMPTION IT'S REPEOPLEARE STILL I I SEE THE THE A PLENTY OF FOLKS WHO ARE A SIXTY FIVE AND OLD ARE EATING PLENTY OF CARBOHYDRATES YOU'RE SAYNG A LOT OF THEM HAVE DEFICIENT DIROID TOS NOSTRONE ESTROGEN R A PROLACTIN ET CETERA BECAUSE OF THE WADE THERE'S THOSE CARBOHYDROTS ARE NOT STUDYING THE A DE HORNONC EXACTLY SO THERE THE WHOLE OF THOSE ARE GLIKE APPROACHINE HORMONS LET'S TEE THAT UP FOR LATER CAUSE I THINK THAT'S IN YOUS A VERY I PORHAVEN YU TO GO GAND THERE'S AND THERE'S A DISEASE IN CHILDREN IN IN BABIES CALLED CONGENERAL DISORDERS OF GLEOSCILLATION WHERE YOU CAN'T PUT AA LUCOS MOLE A MOLECULES ON SPECIFIC PROTINES AN ICROSES SEVERE MENTAL RETURDATION ALL SORTS OF METABOLIC HAVE IT AND LOTOS BABIES DIE FOR THAT MATTER SO IT'S AN IMPORTANT THING I BUT THAT'S HOW IMPORTANT GLUCOS IS FRUCTOS ON THE OTHER HAND THIS SWEET MOLECULE THE MOLECULE WE SEET THE REASON WHY THE FOOD IN THE STREET STUDS EVERY FOOD IN THE GROCERY STORE I SEVENTY THREE PERCENT OF ALL ITEMS IN THE AMERICAN GROCERY STORE HAVE ADDED SUGAR ON PURPOSE FOR THE FOUDENSTRIES PURPOSES NOT FOR YOURS BECAUSE FRUCTOSIS ADDICTIVE ACTIVATES THE NUCLY SUCCUMBENS THE REWARD CENTER OF THE BRAIN IN THE SAME WAY THAT HO COCANE HEROINE NICCATINE ALCOHOL DO AND DRIVE DOPMEAN RECEPTORS DOWN JUST LIKE NECATINE IN ALCOHOL IN COCANE HEROINE DO THAT MOLECULE FRUCTOS S NUMBER ONE A COMPLETELY VESTIGILE TO ALL VERTEBRATE LIFE THERE IS NO BILECHEMICAL REACTION IN ANY VERTEBRATE THAT REQUIRES DIETARY FRUCTOS THAT'S NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO  OCADES US ARIOMINAJUS EDSERT SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT EVEN THOUGH WE CAN PROCESS FRCTOS WE HAVE A LIMITED CAPACITY TO PROCESS IT IN THE SAME WAY WAY AVE A LIMITED CAPACITY METABOLIZE ALCOHOL  IF YOU HAVE ONE DRINK O DAY YOUROCET YOUHAVE TO DRINKS TO DAY DEPENDS ON HOW BIG YOU ARE YOU KNOW YOU AND I CAN PRO LI WOULD ARGUE TWO DRINKS A WEEK AS THE MAXIMUM BUT  LET'S NOT GO THERE THE AB BUT BUT IN TERMS OF YOURE SAYING WHEN YOU SAY FRUCTOS PROCESSING AFROCTOS IS VASTIDUL WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT WE DON'T NEED TO DO IT THAT'S  IS LIKE THE APPENDIX IT'S AN ORGAN FOR WHICH IT HAS NO FUNCTION EXACTLY AND FRUCTOS HAS NO FUNCTION IN THE HUMAN BODY PERIOD YOU DON'T NEED IT YOU DON'T NEED IT DON'T NEED IT BUT  DI IT IS REPLET WITH IT IN FACT O FRUCTOS CONSUMPTIONS GONE UP TWENTY FIVE FOLD SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE LAST CENTURY I HALF TO ASK HIS NOW I LOVE FRUIT I E BERRIES GOLOWER SPECHLLY SINCE THE PRICE OF BERRIE SEEMS TO HAVE COME DOWN I US TO BE THE ONLY GET IM CERTAIN TIMES A YEAR NOM WHAT YOU CALL A DRIVE BY BLUEBERRY EATER I'LL JUST WALK PASSANGE TO TAKE A TISFULAT YOU CAN'T PUT THEM IN FRONT OF ME WITHOUT ME EATING THEM AS IS EVEN DIFFICULT FOR ME WHEN OTHER PEOPLE I DON'T KNOW OR EATING THEM SO IM I LOTS OF BLUEBERRIES IN STRAWBERRIES BLACKBERRIES IF THERE IN SEASON I LOVE THEM YOU PROBLE LOADED WITH FRUCTOS NO PLENTY OF FIBRE LO FRUCTOS LOFRUCTOS OM BERRIES BERRIES OF THE LOWEST FRUCTOS AA OLE OXILERY ABOUT ASKING THIS TO DAY NOT  OK IM AND FRUIT IS O K BECAUSE OF THE FIBRE SO THE MOLECULE THE FRUCTOS MOLECULES THE SAME WHETHER IT'S IN A BERRY OR IN IN BANANA OR FOR THAT MATTER IN A COCOCOLA THE FRUCTOS MOLECULE IS THE SAME MOLECULE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT IN THE BERRY IT COMES WITH A WHOLE LOT OF FIBRE IN THE BANANA COMES WITH A WHOLE LOT LESS FIBRE AND IN THE COCOCOLAT DOESN'T COME WITH ANY FIBRE AND THE FIBRE IS WHAT MITIGATES THE ABSORPTION SO WHEN YOU CONSUME THE FRUCTOS WITH FIBR SO YOUR BLUEBERRIES YOUR FEEDING YOUR MIKE ROBIUM THAT FRUCTOS WASN'T FOR YOU GOT IT SUCH A RELIEF AND A I I MUST SAY RECENTLY AD A WHOLE BODY AM AR I AS A  OK RYA  NOTHING AS HOW MUCH IS THAT  WAS GREAT I GOT TO WATCH AN AT FLICXS IN THERE AND NOW I NEVER HAD A WHOLEBODY EMER I LEARNED A FEW THINGS THAT WERE USEFUL TO ME AI'VE GOT A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH SO THAT'S GRAN LIS ONEED ONE OF THAT PIECE OF FEE BACK I GOT IS A THAT MY GOT WAS FILLED WITH THITS VERY HIGH CONTRAST I'M STOFF AND THEY ASKED YOU KNOW DO YOU CONSUME A LOT OF BLUEBERRIES AND I SAID INDEED I DO WHY AND THEY SAID UN BECAUSE THAT HIGH CONTRAST OF IT SHOWS AP WHITE ON THE SCAN IT IS IM HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF MAGNESIUM IM THAT WE SEE IN PEOPLE THAT IN JEST LARGE AMOUNTS OF BLUEBERRIES WHICH IS PRETTY RARE AND YOURS ARE COMPARABLE TO A BARE IN BLUEBERRY SEASON WHELL IM AND BUSY MY ENTIRE GOT WAS FILLED WITH WITH BLUEBERRIES I SUPPOSE I NEED TO CUT BACK A LOW BIT BUT NOW I KNOW THAT FRUIT IS O K ESPECIALLY IF THE FRUIT HAS A LOT OF FIBRE BUT FRUCTOS ITSELF ESPECIALLY IF IT'S NOT PARTNERED WITH FIBRE IS FRST WELL NOT REQUIRED FOR SURVIVAL AT ALL BUT YOUR TIME ME IS A PROBLEM ATER YES AND LET ME TELL YOU WHY IT'S PROBLEMATIC WE HAVEN'T GOT INTO THAT YET WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT WHETHER IT'S VESTIGIL VERSES NEEDED NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT FRUCTOS DOES TURNS OUT FRUCTOS INHIBITS THREE CONE THREE SEPARATE AN TIMES NECESSARY FOR NORMAL MITACONDRIAL FUNCTION NOW I YOU'RE MIHTA CONTRY MAKE E T P YOU'RE MIGHT A CO T YOU HAVE TO WORK AT PQU EFFICIENCY THAT'S WHAT METABOLIC HEALTH IS IS MIGHT ACCONJURE WORKING A PIQUE EFFICIENCY WELL THERE ARE THREE ENSIMES THAT ARE INHIBITED I FRACTOS NUMBER ONE A M P KINASE I MPIKINASEIS THE FUEL GAUGE ON THE LIVER CELL IT'S THE THING THAT TELLS THE LIVER TO MAKE MOR MITA CONJURE FRESHER MITA CNJURE BECAUSE IF YOURE A M P LEVELS OR HIGH THAT MEANS YOU'VE DEPHOSPHORALATED A BUNCH OF EIGH T PS AND YOU HAVE TO REGENERATUM SO YOU NEED SOME MORE MITA CONJURE SAS NEGATIVE F BACK PATHWAY WELL YOU NEED THAT A M PKCINESE TO GENERATE THAT MITACONJIO BIOGENISI SIGNAL EXCEPT THAT FRUCTOS A METABOLIT OF FRECTOS CALLD METHEL GLIOXEL M GO SITS IN THE ACTIVE SIDE OF THE GAMASUBUNIT OF THAT A M PCINASE AND ACTUALLY BINDS TO ARGENINES IN THAT ACT OF SIGHT RENDERING THAT A A ENDS IM NOW DEAD IT'S AN IRREVERSIBLE INEBICIEN BECAUSE OF THE COVELENT BONDING OF THAT METHELGLOXEL THAT ALDAHIDE TO THE ARGENINE AND NOW THAT ENDSIME IS DEAD A CASES OF IT BASILY ACTS LIKE A KEY THAT DOESN'T TURN THE LOCH BUT PREVENTS THE THE KEY THAT YOU WANT IN THAT LOC THERM ENTERING THE GETLOCH IT'S LIKE IT'S LIKE GLUEING A LOCH SHUT YET OT IT  THAT THAT ONE OF THE ENSIM THAT'S ONE SECOND ONE A HEAD EL ASAL COE DHADRAGIN A LONG CHAIN THIS IS NECESSARY TO CLEAVE TO CARGEN FRAGMENTS OF FATTY ACIDS TO PREPARE THEM FOR A A METABOLISM SO INHIBITS THAT ONE AND THE FINALLY IT HIBITS CARNATINE PULMITALE TRANSFRACE ONE O S P T ONE NOW THAT'S THE ENSIGME THAT REGENERATES CARNATINE CARNATINE IS THE SHUTTLE MECHANISM BY WHICH YOU GET THE AFATTY ACIDS FROM THE OUTER MITA CONJU MEMBRANE THRU TO THE INNER MITACONJO MEMBRANE SO THAT THEY CAN BE BATA OXIDIZE FOR ENERGY SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT S A S P T ONE YOU'R BASICALLY CARNATINELESS AND THEREFORE YOU CAN GENERATE A BAT OXIDATION E SAID FORTUS INHIBITS ALL THREENG THESE ANSMATIC PATHWAYS YET AS BY ALL JUST TI HAVE TO ASKOU HOW POTENTLY DOES IT INHIBIT THEM I MEAN CAUSE THERE'S THERE ARE DRUGS THAT BLOCK RECEPTORS AND THEN THERE DRUGS THE BLOCH RESAPTERIS WITHIN UNBELIEVABLE AFFINITY SO YOU KNOW I M A MECHANISTICALLY IN A DISH MEANING AN VITRO ETEN THE ALL SORTS OF THINGS BUT HOW HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THIS FOR LIKE FOR OBICITY FOR MIHTACONJU FUNCTION IN VIVO IN AS ASOLA THE THE DOSE DETERMINES THE POISON RI PARACELSIS FIFTEEN THIRTY SEVEN A THERE ARE TOXINS THAT ARE PARTS PERBILLION AND WILL KILL YOU LIKE SEREN RISON SIONIDE BYTHER SIONIZES A GOOD ANALOGY BECAUSE IT'S WORKI ON MYTA CONJURE IT'S BASICALLY CAUSING MYTA CONJRION TO IEE  HAVE COMPLETELY DEFECTIVE I THEN THERE ARE A INTERMEDIATE TOXINS LIKE ARSONIC AND CARBENTETRO CHLORIDE PARTS PERMILION AND THEY TAKE A LITTLE LONGER TO WORK THAN NOT IN KILL YOU ON THE SPOT THAT'S WHY I CAN EAT AN APPLE SEED THAT HAS A LOW BIT OF OURSON I CAN AT BUT 'RE NOT CIN TO DIE RIGHT AND THEN FINALLY THERE AND BY THE TOBACCO SMOKE GOES IN THERE AND THEN FINALLY YOU HAVE A A WEAK TOXINS I AND YOUKNOW WHERE IT'S NOT ONE EXPOSURE THAT WILL KILL YOU ITS YOU KNOW TEN THOUSAND EXPOSURES THAT'LL KILL YOU LIKE ALCOHOLL WERE TOXIC PEOPLE YET E TOXS OF WELL SOMETOETIMES AT I HA ATI ENTERS THAT RI SOMETIMES IT ONL MILDLY TOXIC WEEBLE ANYWAY THE POINT IS THAT FROCTOSE IS IN THAT LAST CATEGORY SO IT'S NOT WHAT YOU DO ONE DAY THAT KILLS YOU IT'S WHAT YOU DO EVERY DAY THAT KILLS YOU AND IF YOU BASICALLY EAT ULTRAPROSESS FOOD I IN SUGAR FOR TEN YEARS IN A ROW IT'S GOON O SHOW UP IN TERMS OF YOUR COMOBIDITIES AND ULTIMATELY YET IT WILL KILL YOU AND WE HAVE THE DATA TO SHOW YU KNO HOW MANY YEARS YOUWILL LOSE SO RIGHT NOW IN AMERICA WE PAY AND EIGHT YEAR LONGEVITY TAX IF YOU LOOK AT JAPAN WHO THAT THEY HAVE A MEAN AGE OF DEATH OF EIGHTY EIGHT WE HAVE A MEAN AGE OF EIGHTY WE'RE PAYING IN EIGHT YOUAR LUNJEVY TEXT JUST BY LIVING HERE AND WE'RE TOLK ABOUT THE HEALTHY PEOPLE NOW IF YOU HAVE MET A BOLOCINDROME IT'S A FIFTEEN YEAR LONGEVITY TAX AND SA IF YOU OBICITIES OF FIFTEEN YEAR LUNGEVY TEXIF YET META BALENDRO IT'S A TWENTY YEAR LONGEVITY TAX THAT IS PRIMARILY NOT COMPLETE BUT PRIMARILY SUGAR IT'S ALSO YOU KNOW I'L MAKE A SIXI IS ITS OUL SO TRANSFATS YOU KNO LEFT OVER BECAUSE NOW THEY'RE GONE BUT YOU KNO PEOPLE STILL SUFFERING THE RAVAGES OF THE TRANSFATS YOU KNOW FROM THE PREVIOUS GENERATION ARE THEY GONE I M I DO REMEMBER AS A KID WHEN WE HAD MARGER AND AND ND OUR REFRESERATOR THE ARY A BIG T AIT IN MY HOME AT ONE PARENT I WANT IDENTIFY WHICH A WAS PRO MARGERAN THE OTHER WAS PRO BUTTER ANTI MARGER AND RI ON THE MARRIAGE HAT LAST BUT THERE WERE OTHER REASONS  THAT'S PROBABLY WA I WENT BUTTER A BUTTERED YUTTERS FINE IN FACT TIME DECLARED YOU KNO  FRONT COVER BUTTERS BACK YOUA MARGERIN WAS THE BAD GUY WITHOUT QUESTION AND WE KNOW NOW BUT YOU KNOW BACK WHEN WE THOUGHT IT WAS  CALLORY WAS A GALLORY WE THOUGHT O MARGERAN YOU KNOW IT'S THE SAME YOU KNOW NINE CALLORYES PROGRAM AND WE SAID IT LOWERS YOURE TRIGLESSURIDES BAD I DEA IT WAS BECAUSE WHAT IT DID WAS IT LIND YOUR LIVER BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T BREAK THAT TRINS DOUBLE MOND AND A YSO THEY'RE THEY'RE NOW GONE FROM OUR FOOT SUPPLY THEY'RE LEGAL THE'RE LEGAL THEY'RE BAND BUT YOU CAN MAKE TRANSFASTS IN YOUR OWN KITCHON BY TAKING OLIF OIL AND HEETING IT TO BEYOND THE SMOKING POINT SO THEY'RE NOT COMPLETELY GONE THEY'RE JUST GONE FROM ULTRA PROCESS FOOD SO NOW SUGAR 'S THE BIG PROBLEM BECAUSE OF THESE THREE INSIGNES THAT YOU ARE INHIBITING THE POINT IS WEERE WE STARTED THIS WITH A CALORIES A CALORY WELL IF YOU ARE INHIBITING MATACONGIAL FUNCTION THEN IY CALORIES NOT A CALORY IS IT YOU'RE REDUCING THE A INTENSITY THE FURNACE YE EXACTLY SO THIS WHOLE CALORIES A CALORY JUST MAKES NO SENSE TAND IT HASN'T WORKED AT ANY LEVEL AND THERE IS NO STUDY THAT ACTUALLY SHOWS THAT CUTTING CALORIES MAKES A DIFFERENCE AND I CAN SHOW YOU YOU KNOW VOLUMINOUS DATA THAT SHOWS THAT VIRTUALLY EVERY WEIGT LOST STUDY THAT CA THAT LED TO IN A COLOR RESTRICTION BASICALLY DIDN'T WORK NOT FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME JUST TO ROUND OUT OUR EARLIER DISCUSSION CAUSE I FIND IT FASCINATING AND I KNOW OTHER PEOPLE WILL AS WELL TALKED ABOUT THAT HUNDR AND SIXTY CALORIES HIT'S ACTUALY HUNDR AND THIRTY AT THE BUSINESS END OF THINGS OF ALMONDS WE TALKED ABOUT THE PORTERHOUSE STAKE WITH BUTTER AND THE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT REDUCTION IN WHAT'S ACTUALLY CUOTINCUOT EATEN AND I'LL GET BACK TO THIS CAS AT THIS QUOTEN QUOTE ISSUE I THINK THE PROMISE THERE'S THERE'S A LACK OF USEFUL LANGUAGE TO DISSOCIATE THIS STUFF YYOU KNOW EVEN JUST CALLING FAT FAT PEOPLE THINK IT MATS GANIN T MAKE YOU GAN BODY FAT IF WE CALL THE ADAPOS TISSUE AND LIPIDS WE NIT WOULD HAVE AVOIDED THIS CONFUSION SO I I DON'T WAT IT YET THEY'RE JUST YET BUT I WANT TO MAKE SUREAT THE FOD INDUSTRY DOES THIS ON PURPOSE WEN OH ABSOLUTELY SO THEY'VES TELL YOU A SUGAR IS A SUGAR WHICH IS NOT TRUE THEY TELL YOU A CALORIES A CALORY WHICH IS NOT TRUE AND THEY TELL YOU A FAT AS A FAT WHICH IS NOT TRUE THIS IS VERY SPECIFICALLY SO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SUGAR YOU TALKING ABOUT DIETARY SUGAR WE TALKING AOUT BLOOD SRUE CAUSE BLUDCHER IS BLOWN A LOU COAST WE'RE NI LIT OF DRAWERS DIETARY COLLESTERAL OR CIRCULATING COLLESTERALL OR YOT ABSOLUTELY SO WE  WE'VE DONE THIS A THEY KNOW TO OURSELVES BUT THE FOOD INDUSTRY HAS REALLY PROMULGATED BECAUSE WE FARMED OUT NUTRITION POLICY AND INFORMATION TO THE FOOD IN THE STREET SO THEY ACTUALLY USES FOR THEIR PURPOSES ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IN THIS FIELD AS WE ALL KNOW QUALITY NUTRICION INFLUENCES OF COURSE OUR PHYSICAL HEALTH BUT ALSO OUR MENTAL HEALTH AND OUR COGNET FUNCTIONING OUR MEMORY OUR ABILITY TO LEARN NEW THINGS AND TE FOCUS AND WE KNOW THAT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURES OF HIGH QUALITY NUTRICION IS MAKING SURE THAT WE GET ENOUGH VIDEMENS AND MINERALS FROM HIGH QUALITY UNPROCESSED OR MINIMILY PROCESS SOURCES AS WELL AS ENOUGH PROBIOTICS AND PREBOTICS AND FIBR TO SUPPORT THASICALLY ALL THE CELLAR FUNCTIONS IN OUR BODY INCLUDING THE GOP MICRO B IOM NOW I LIKE MOST EVERYBODY TRY TO GET OPTIMAL NUTRICION FROM WHOLE FOODS IDEALLY MOSTLY FROM MINIMALY PROCESSE OR NON PROCESS FOODS HOWEVER ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT I AND SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE FACE IS GETTING ENOUGH SERVINGS OF HIGH QUALITY FRUITS AND VEGETABLES PER DAY AS WELL AS FIBER AND PROBIOTICS THAT OFTEN ACCOMPANY THOSE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THAT'S WHY WAY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND IN TWELVE LONG BEFORE I EVER HAD A PODCAST I STARTED DRINKING A G ONE AND SO 'M DELIGHTED THE A G ONE IS SPONSORING THE HUBERMAN LA POD CAST THE REASON I STARTED TAKING A G ONE AND THE REASON I STILL DRINK A G ONE ONCE OR TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT PROVIDES ALL F MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS THAT IS IT PROVIDES INSURANCE THAT I GET THE PROPER AMOUNTS OF THOSE VIDAMENS MINERALS PROBIOTICS AND FIBR TO INSURE OPTIMAL MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY A G ONE YOU CAN GO TO DRINK A G ONE DOK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THE'RE GIVING AWAY FIV FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUSS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THREE K TOO AGAIN THAT'S DRINK A G ONE DO CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THAT SPECIAL OFFER FOR THE THIRD CATEGORY MACRONUTRANES CARBOHYDRATES I DEFRENTIATED IM GLUCOS AND FRUCTOS IF I INJEST IM LET'S A A HALF A BAGEL AM SIS WERTIME AT NEW YORK YOU'RE SITY ORIGIN THEY HAVE GREABAGLES ON THE WEST COST YEN YET IS NOT IS ITS IT'S PRETTY PIT IF THE SAME IT THE PECES AS DO AS LAK THE CLAIM IT'S THA THA THE WATER WHEN WHATEVER IT IS IT'S DIFFERENT BACK THERE IN ITS BETTER THE HALF A BAGAEL LET'S SAY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY CALORIES MOSTLY CARBOHYDRATE THIS IS AN AN UNLINED UN NO CREAM CHEESE NO SCHMEAR AS THEY CALL BACK THERE NO NO CREAM CHEESE NO BUTTER NOTHER THING JUST HALF THE THEY  ENDERVIFT CALLORIES SO THAT'S WHAT I AT YOU'RE SAYING THAT A CALLORY EATEN IS NOT A CALORY EATEN HOW MUCH OF THAT CARBOHYDRATE GIVEN THAT IT'S PROBABLY MOST LET'S ASSUME IT'S MOSTLY GLUCOSTLETS DO IT THIS WAY YET IT IS IT'S BLUMERISE GLUCOA PLERMOENUCOS HOW MUCH OF THAT IS ACTUALLY UDILIZED WERE BURNED VERSES AM YOU KNOW THAT THE OURIGINAUNTY FIFITY SO IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS TO ENERGY IN THE BODY SIXTY FIVE PER CENT OF THAT WHICH IS INGESTED GOES TO RESTING ENERGY EXPENDITURE JUST TO POWER THE BODY TEN PER CENT GOES TO THE SERMIC EFFECTIVE FOOD AND THEN TWENTY FIVE PER CEN GOES TO ACTIVITY THAT'S THE BREAK DOWN OF WERE THE A ENERGY GOES AN THAT'S CALORIES FROM FAT PROTINE AND CARBIVE YET FROM EVERYTHING TOGETHER AND YOU KNOW GLUCOSES A PERFECTLY GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW THAT WORKS THE POINT IS THOUGH THAT WHEN YOU IN GJEST GLUCOS YOU'RE GETTING A BIG GLUCOS EXCURSION IN YOUR BLOOD STREAM SO YOU'RE GETTING A BIG GLUCO SPIKE AND THAT GLUO SPIKE HAS TO COME DOWN WELL WHAT MAKES IT COME DOWN TE HORMON INSOLENT INSOLENT IS THE BAD GUY IN THE STORY THE HIRE YOUR GLUCOS GOES THE MORE YOUR PAN CREOUS WILL RELEASE INSOLENT IN ORDER TO BRING THAT GLUCOST DOWN WELL TURNS OUT THAT GLUCOS RISE WAS NOT BENIN THAT GLUCOS RISE LED TO EN THE FELIAL DISFUNCTION TRANSIENT BUT NONE THE LESS END THE FELIAL DISFUNCTION CAN YOUSIM REMIND PEOPLE WHAT ENDO THEALIAL SELLS ARE INSIDE OF YOUR ARTERIES KE AND IT WILL CHANGE BLOOD PRESSURE WE'VE GOT PLENTY O DATED TO DEMONSTRATE HOW IT CHANGES BLOOD PRESSURE AND OVER TIME THAT WILL CLAUSE CORNERY ARTERY DISEASE THAT WILL CLAUSE KIDNEY DISEASE ET CETERA BUT IT'S THE INSOLENT RESPONSE THAT IS REALLY THE BAD GUY NOW PEOPLE THINK INSOLENT IS GOOD BECAUSE IT LOWERS BLOOD GLUCOSE AFTER ALL DIABETICS TAKE INSOLENT YOU KNOW TO LOWER THEIR BLOOD GLUCOS OKE LET'S TAKE A DIABETIC PA PATION WITH DIABES BLUTSHUGAR'S THREE HUNDRED THAT'S BAT WE GIVEIM A SHOT OF INSOLENT IN THE ARM BUTSHUGAR GOES DOWN TO ONE HUNDRED BLUTSHUGER WENT FROM THREE HUNDRED TO ONE HUNDRED OKE WHERE DID THE TWO HUNDRED POINTS OF BLOOD GLUCOS GO I'M ASSUMING THAT THE INSOLENT WITH SEQUESTERED IT TO WHERE I'M ASSUMING TO THE LIVER TO THE FAT INTERESTED FOR STORAGE THAT'S INSLENCE JOB INSOLENT TAKES WHATEVER YOU'RE NOT BURNING AND PUTS IT INTO FAT FOR STORAGE INOLENT IS NOT THE DIABEDISWORM ON INLENT IS THE ENERGY STORAGE HORMEL HOW QUICKLY DOES IT DO THAT BECAUSE  QUICK ECAUSE IF I'M YOU KNOW HAVING OM THAT A VERY BUSY DAY WERE THAT DIABETIC PERSON IS HAVING A VERY BUSY DAY AND THEY'RE MOVING AROUND A LOT THEN YOU GOT INSOLENT BOUND GLUCOST IN THE BLOOD STREAM A R HOW LON'T NO INSOLENT DOESN'T BIND GLUCOSE INSOLENT BINDS TO ITS RECEPCHARISECARIS AND ALLOWS FOR GLUCOS TRANSITORTORS EVERYR SO SO BUT FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME WHILE THAT PERSON IS ACTIVE THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO UTILIZE THAT GLUCOS W ATT RIGHT A BUT SO HOW QUICKLY IS INSOLEN MANAGING THAT GLUCOS WE KNOW THAT THE SPITE COMES DOWN QUICKLY BUT THE GLUCOSE IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR ENERGY UTILIZATION AFTER WHAT IT'S IRRIS T A SEQUESTER TO THE THE ATIPOST TO THE FAT TISSUE AT WITHIN AN HOUR TASO ABOUT NINETY MINUTES BUT I LEFT YOU IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE ACTIVE IF YOU EAT E YOU KNOW  MUFFIN AND YOU'RE ACTIVE YOUR MUSCLES ARE GOING TO TAKE UP THAT GLUCOS IRRESPECTIVE OF INSOLENT IN FACT MUSCLES OUR INSOLENT INDEPENDENCE THEY HAVE GLUCOS TRANSPORTERS BUT THEY ARE INSOLENT IN DEPENDENT BECAUSE IF THEY WEREN'T THEN EVERY PATIENT IN DIABETIQUITOACIDOSIS WOULD BE PARALYZED E SO GLUCOS WILL END UP IN MUSCLES IRRESPECTIVE OF ENERGY STATUS AND A INSOLENC STATUS AND IN MUSCLES ITS USED AS IMMEDIATE FUEL AND GLICAGING BOTH OITUL AND GLIKAGEIND STORAGE IN THE MUSCLE ABSOLUTELY I NOW IF YOU OR ACTIVE THEN YOUWILL CLEAR LUCOS INTO MUSCLE THEREFORE YOUR BLUGLUCOS WON'T RISE AS MUCH AS IT WENT INTO MUSCLE AND THEREFORE YOUR PANCREES WILL PUT OUT LESS INSOLENT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO CLEAR AS MUCH FROM THE BLOOD STREAM AND THAT'S HO CAY THAT'S GOOD BUT LET'S SAY YOU DIDN'T EXERCISE SO YOU'VE GOT A BIG GLUCOS EXCURSION NOW YOU HAVE A BIG INSOLENT RESPONSE AND THAT INSOLENT IS GOING TO TAKE THE EXCESS THAT SINYOUR BLOOD IT HAS TO CLEAR IT AND IT WILL GO TO FAT FOR SGEORGE THAT INSOLENT RISE TURNS OUT TO BE PARTICULARLY AGGRIEGIOUS IN TERMS OF METABOLIC DISEASE AND I CAN PROVE IT THERE IS A MOUSE MY FAVORITE MOUSE I LOFT THIS MOUSE THIS MOUSE TURNS MEDICINE ON ITS HEAD AND TEACHES EVERY DOCTOR WHY THEY HAVE TO GO BACK TO MEDICAL SCHOOL AND LEARN IT RIGHT THIS MOUSE IS CALLED THE PODURCO MOUSE PIOD IARCAO IS IT DISCOVERED BY PEDERCO NO NO IS A DISCARDEN RONCONS LAVS MANUFACTURED AND RONCONSLEP SO THIS IS A TISSUE SPECIFIC INSOLENT RECEPTOR KNOCKOUT MOUSE I ARCO IN SO LASSE INSOLENT RECEPTER IN INIT'S VEVIC KIDNEY IN THE KIDNEY INTOSE  DERCOP COMGLUMERULAR POTICITE INSOLENT RECEPTOR KNOCKOGOUS WE HAVEN'T TALK TO MUCH ABOUT TRANSGANIC MODELS AND KNOCKENS AND KNOCKOUT SO I JUST IN TEN SECOND R LAST BASICALLY THESE ARE MICE THAT ARE GENETICALLY ENGINEERED TOU LACK THE RECEPTOR FOR INSOLENT SPECIFICALLY IN THE IT GLEMERIAL POTICITE THO IDNEY IN IN THE KIDNEY AND EVERYWHERE ELSE IN THIS MOUSE INSOLEN AS ITS THING NORMALLY EXACT GRAT SO THESE ANIMALS ARE YOU GLISIMIC NORMAL BLUGLUCOS LEVELS THESE ANIMALS ARE NORMALLY GLUCUS TOLERANT THAT MEO GO UP THEY GO DOWN JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER MOUSE THESE MICE ARE NOT FAT THESE MICE ARE NOT THIN THESE MICE ARE MICE EXCEPT THEY HAVE THE WORST DIABETIC NEFROPITHY ON THE PLANET TO THEIR NER OF THEIR KIDNEY IS DEGENERED THEIR KIDNEYS DEGENERATE TO NOTHING I NOW THEY HAVE NORMAL BLOOD GLUCOS LEVELS THEY HAVE NORMAL GLUCOS TOLERANCE THEY HAVE NORMAL INSOLENT TOLERANCE WHOLE BODY BUT THEIR KIDNEYS ARE DYING HOW COME CAN'T BE THE GLUCOSE IT'S THE INSOLENT BECAUSE INSOLENS THE BAD GUY INSOLENCE ACTUALLY MAKING THE KIDNEY DICEASE AND SO THESE ANIMALS THAT ARE INSOLENT RESISTANT THEY HAVE THI A BETTIC NEPHROPATHY WITHOUT DIABETES SO THE INSOLENT IS HAVING A NEGATIVE CLEARLY NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE KIDNEYS WITHOUT BINDING TO THE RECEPTOR EXAMPLE SO CIRCULATING INSOLENT CAN DOSTUFF WITHOUT BINING TO ITS RECEPTOR WELL IT'S NO MINES TO ITS RECEPTOR IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BODY OTHER PARTS OF THE BOD I' PUTTING THE GNEY IT CAN'T CAUSE IT'S A NOB BECAUSE IT'S NOT YET RIGHT THE POINT IS INSOLEN DOES STUFF BY IT SELF AND TURNS OUT INSOLEN DRIVES GROWTH NOW EVERY CELL IN YOUR BODY ONCS TO BURN AT ONE TIME IN SLIFE AT ONCS TO GROW AT ANOTHER TIME IN SLIFE EVERY CELL HAS THOSE TWO PATHWAYS BURNING GROWTH BURNING GROWTH WHAT DETERMINS WETHER A CELL SHOULD BE BURNING WHETHER A CELL SHOULD BE GROWING I DON'T KNOW WHAT MAKES IT I'M BURNING BUT PRESEMBLETS IN THE HAS ONLY DO WITH MY TO CONDR IT HAS EVERYTHINTON SO EVERY CELL NEEDS TO BURN NEEDS TO GROW AT A DIFFERENT TIME N SLIFE HERE'S A WAY TO THINK ABOUT WE ALL START OUT AS A ZI GOAT A SINGLE CELL WE END UP IN ADULT NOW THAT SINGLE CELL HAD TO BECOME TWO CELLS THOSE TWO CELLS HAD TO BECOME FORECELS THOSE FORECELLS HAD TO BECOME EIGHT CELLS AN ON ANON ANON ANON SO EVERY CYCHLE THERE'S DOUBLNG HOW MANY DOUBLINGS TO GET FROM A ZI GOAT TO AN ADULT WHAT'S IN EXPENENTIAL GROWTH SO YET I DON'T I DON'T KNOW IT OFT THE TOP OF MY HEAD FORTY ONE FORTY ONE FORTY ONE TWO TO THE FORTY ONE DOUBLINGS YOU GIVE YOU AN ORGAN IS TEN TRILLION CELLS WE'RE TEN SHRILLINGS OTENTRILIONS WE KNOW THAT YET  TWO TO THE FORTY ONE  O IT NOW OF THOSE FORTY ONE DUBLINGS SOME OF THEM HAD TO OCCUR IN UTERO SOME OF THEM HAD TO OCCUR POST NATALY SO I NEED TWO NUMBERS THAT AD UP TO FORTY ONE HOW MANY IN UTERO HOW MANY POSTNATALY WEL WAY MORE YUYOU START OFF WITH A LOT MORE THAN YOU END UP WITH BUT THEN YOU'V CELLS THAT TURN OVER THROUGHOUT THE LIFE SPANSE THIS IS A TOUGH ONE GET SKIN SELLS TURN OVER WITH NURONS IT'S IT'S PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD BECAUSE YOURE GAN I IT SOMEWORE GLEN TO GEY IN WITH EN IT RIGHT WELL YOU'RE AND YOU'RE BORN WITH SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THREE AND TEN ACTS OF WHAT YOU END UP WITH DEPENNING ON THE BRAINSTRUCTUR SO BUT WHOLE BODY WIDE I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU'D COME UP WITH THAT NUMBER THIRTY SIX AND FIVE  THIRTY SIX DOUBLINGS PRENATALY FIVE DOUBLINGS POSTNATALY I CAN PROVE THAT TO YOU TWO TYPICAL BABY WEIGHS SEVEN POUNDS FIRST DOUBLING FOURTEEN POUNDS SECOND DOUBLING TWENTY OF EIGHT POUNDS SEXT DOUBLING FIFTY SIX POUNDS NEXT DOUBLING HUNDRED TWELVE POUNDS NEXT DOUBLIN TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR POUNDS AND DOUBLY ITS  RECENT OFLIES DOVS THERE I NOT OT NOT ALL BE IN WEN ATRAL  AUTHOR ROBIES AH BUT SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE  CERTAIN HEIGHTS OR BELOW OR YET TWO UNDREDROVER ROBYS OINT IS THE SELL HAS TO KNOW WHEN TO GROW AND WHEN TO BURN THE TURNS OUT THAT THE SIGNAL FOR THAT IS OXYGEN BECAUSE OXYGEN'S NECESSARY FOR MYT CONTRY TO BE ABLE TO BURN IN THE ABSENCE OF OXYGEN THE SELL ONLY KNOWS HOW TO GROW THIS IS ACTUALLY WHY OTA WARBURG WON THE NOCAL PRIZE IN NINETEEN THIRTY ONE FOR THE WARBURG EFFECT HE ASKED THE QUESTION HOW COME CANCER CELLS DON'T NEED OXYGEN TO GROW AND THE ANSWERS AS NO CELL THES OXYGEN TO GROW IN FACT OXYGEN IS THE THING THAT PREVENTS GROWTH FAMOUS ARTICLE FROM THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE NINETEEN FIFTY ONE MOUNT EVERIST IN UTEROW BECAUSE EVERY FETIS IS OXYGEN DEPRIVED SO NORMAL PARTIAL PRESSURE OF OXYGEN HUNDRED MILLIMETERS MERCURY OUT HERE RIGHT YOIF IVI CHECKED YOUR BLOOD TO BE ABOUT A HUNDRED RIGHT I HOPE SO HOW ABOUT A TUMERSEL AM GUESSIG T TOMERCELLS PROBABLY IS IT DOUBLE BOUT FORTY FOR WA YOU JUST TOORSIAL PRESSURE OF A OXYGEN IN A TUMORCELL IS ABOUT FORTY FOR WE YOU'SE TOLD ME THAT WHAT TOMERCELLS WHICH GROW LIKE WILD RIGHT THEY GROW LIKE WILD BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE OXYGEN BUT THEY BUT THERE'S SOME OF T SO HERES WHAT'S PECULIAR ABOUT IT UM TOMERCELLS ARE SOME OF THE MOST VASCULAROS CELLS ER A TUMERS ARE OR HAVE AL THER AST CRYINE MN'T OMING ONE WAY TO WHAT A WAY A THA NOU OCTRECAL WANT IS TO TO DE VASCULERIZA TO RU YES AND YOU ANGY GENESIST AND HIBITION AT SETERAS IN IS A BIG DEAL YOU KNOW DOUTIFULCMEN AN ALL THAT FROM HARVARDYOU KNOW SO THE ACCESS OF BLOOD TO A TUMOR IS THE ATTEMPT TO BRING IN OXYGEN THAT IT'S NOT YETI THAT'S HT IS UPPOSE TO DELIVERING LOTS OF OXYGEN AND TAT LI'S GRIN THAT'S RIGHT BUT FETIS WHAT'S THE PARTIAL PRESSURE IN THE PLACENTA SIX TO THIRTY ONE SO IT'S ACTUALLY LIKE A MILE ABOVE MOUNT EVERST THAT'S HOW MUCH OXYGEN THE FEETIST GETS AND IT'S THE FOR THAT REASON THAT YOU'VE GOT THIRTY SIX DOUBLINS AND THEN AS SOON AS YOU'RE OUT YOU KNOW YOU COT THE CORD AND YOU STAR BREATHING AND NOW YOU'R PARTIAL PRESSURES AT A HUNDRED THAT'S WHEN GROWTHS SLOWS DOWN HAS THERE BEEN ANY EFFORT TO TREAT TUMORS BY OXYGENATING TUMERS YES AND WHAT IS THAT LOOK LIKE ITS HYPERBARC OXYGEN THEREBE IT'S A THING O YE YE YET WE LL PROBALY DO AN APISODE ON HYBERBERY CHAMBERS IS THEY THE THE REASON WE HAVEN'T YET IS IT'S PRETTY NECIAN T IT BY THEIR PEOPLE WHO ON THESE THINGS WHO SIT IN THESE THINGS IM OKETE SO WE GOT HERE BY WAY OF BY WAY OF CARPED BY THE BAGEL RIGHT AM SO I JUST WANT TO ORIENTAS IM THEY YOU JUST THAT TWO UNDER FIFTY CALLORIES THE BAGEL WE TALK ABOUT GLUCOS COURAGET IS THAT INSOLEN RISE THAT'S DRIVING THE ATIPOCIDIINS ALSO DRIVING THE GROWTH IN THE ABSENCE OF OXYGEN FIS IF YOU HAVE OXYGEN AND YOU DON'T NEED THAT MUCH INSELIN OQ SO IT BE AISE YOU AN A BURN INSTEAD OF STORE GOT IT IN TERMS OF THE THE A THE RAWMATABOLISM OF CARBOHYDRATE THOU THAT GLUECOSE IF I EAT TWO HUNDRD FIFTY CALORIES OF GLUCOS HOW MUCH OF THAT I DID I CORNICORT ACTUALLY EAT HOW MUCH AS IS USED HO MUCH IS YOU YET WATS ASSUME THAT I'M I'M AT MY DASK WORKING OR IM WALKING AROUND A LITTLE BIT I'M NOT I'M NOT EXERCISING HARD IN THAT IN THE SUBSEQUENT HOUR SO USED FOR WHAT IS THE QUESTION I EXACTOF THE CALORIES IS THE CALORY  CALORY CLEARLY THE ANSWERS KNOW BE BASED ON THE PROCESSING OF DIFFERENT TIPES OF CALRIES WE ESTABLISHD IF FOR FAT THE ALMINS WE STALORSIT FOR PROTINE  THE PORTER HOUSE WITH BUTTER AND NOW WERE WERE TRYING TO STALISH THAT FOR THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY CALORIES OF A BAGEL WHICH IS GLUE COS RSO THE GLUCOS HAS TO BE FUS FOR ELATED SVENA LOSE AIN THE  T P IN THE PROCESS OR OUNIGO EIGH T P GOS TO A D P AD THEN THAT EI D P WILL GO TO A M P A DENIZING MONOPHOS PATE WHICH WILL THEN GO TO I M P A NOCITOL MONOPHOSPHATE WHICH WILL THEN GO TO EURIC ACID  AND THAT YOURIC ACID WILL BE THAN RELEASED FROM THE CELL CIRCULATING BLOOD STREAM AN HOPEFULLY GO OUT IN THE KIDNY IN THE PROCESS THAT EURIC ACID CAN INHIBIT MATACONDUAL FUNCTION AND THIT CAN ALSO INHIBIT AND THE FELIAL NITROCOXIDE SINTHASE WHICH IS THE INSINE IN YOUR VASCULATURE THAT IS YOUR INDOGINOUS BLOOD PRESSURE LOWERER  BY EXPANDING BLOOD VESSELS AND CAPILLARIES EXACTRITE THIS IS THE MECHANISTIC A FOUNDATION OF THE DRUGS THAT WERE ORIGINALLY USED FOR A IMPROVING PROSTATE FUNCTION BUT ARE USED TO TREAT ERECTILE IS FUNCTION WHICH ARE THE THE P P D FIVE INHIHIBITORS WHICH ALLOW NATROCOXIDE TO BE A AROUND LONGER AND MORE OF IT RIGHT HE WLASE IT R ATHER PURPOSES TO I'M NOW NOW ONL FORGET IF I KEW IT UP WITHOUT TAT EXAMPLE WE WE ARE IN INTHE NEINITAL INTENSIFE CARYN IT IT CLOSES PATENT UP TIS ARTURIOSIS WHICH IS A BIG DEAL IN  IN THE TE AN ITALY AA WORLD OCO I I WON'T ASK YOU TUS AT BUT BUT OM SO I HEARD TWO THINGS ONE IS THAT AM GLUCOS AND THE INSOLENT THAT GOES WITH IT INCREASES EURIC ACID EURIC ACID A WHILE ACERTAIN IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS IN HEALTH TOO MUCH OF IT OU SAID CAN INHIBIT NATRICOXIDE YE CAN HI A HUDRO COSA THAT MEANS THAT THE BLOOD VESSELS AND CALORIES AGAINST A MORE CONSTRICTED SO BLOOD PRESSUREIS GN TO BE HIGHER THAN IT WOULD BE NO ASIHT AND THEND YOURIC ACID IS ALSO INHIBITING MITO CONDRIA FUNCTION THAT'S  OQ AM BUT EATING HALF OF BAGEL ISN'T NECESSARILY A TERRIBLE THING IF IT'S WITHIN YOUR CLORIC REQUIREMENTS IT AND  IT ALL DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH A YOU CLEAR AND HOW HIGH YOUR INSALON GOS NOW LET'S COMPARE THAT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY CALORIES OF GLUCOS TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY CALRIES OF FROCTOS  AH LET'S IT LET'S COME UP WITH THE FOOD EXAMPLE TWO HUDRED FIFTY CALRIES OF FROCTOS WOULD BE TRIVIAL TO A CONSUME IN THE FORM OF HIFROCTOS CORN SURU RYO SO REMEMBER THET HIFROCTOS CORN SURPICE HALF GLUCOS HAFRO O CAST LET'S NOT ONE TWENTY FIVE ONE TWENTY FOILU SI IT'S NOT USE THAT WELL SO LET'S USSUME A S WE'S IE BOUT A SODA FOR A TO GET THAT THAT A TWO NDR FIFTY CALORIES EASILY AM I BASHE IF IT'S NOT A CAN OR A EUROPEAN SIZE BOTTLER EDOWNCE EDONCE CAN OF OSODA O CAS O EDOUNCE CANA SODA AM AND MAYBE IT LET'S INCLUDE OF FOOD ITEM WITS TALK LIKE THAT STOREBOUGHT PACKAGE COOKY COUPLE ORIOS TWO WORIOS I GET YOU THAT TWO FIFTY OR MAYY FOR OR E THREE ORS YOK AM ORIO LOVERS EVERYWHERE CELEBRATING THREE TWO HUNDRE FIFTY CALRIES OF FROCTOS WHAT'S THE EFFECT ON YOUR ICACID WHAT'S THE EFFECT ON CLORC BURN WHAT' THE EFFECT ON ANYTHING FOR THAT MATTER THAT A WE SHOULD BE AWARE SO FIRST OF ALL THE ORIO HAS PLENTY OFROCTOS IN IT SO KEEP THAT MY O THE A IF LET'S SAY YOU CONSUMED A TWO UNDRED FIFTY CALORIES IN A BAGEL CAUSE THAT'S PRETTY MUCH PLUMERISE GLUCOS VERSES SAY THE SODA SO THE BAGEL VERSES THE SODA THAT'S WICH EQUIVALENT CALORIES QUIVALENT A WAR THA THE BAGEL VERSIS LETS A TWO ORIOS AND ALO BIT OF AM AND GOT TWO ORIOS SO NUMBER ONE THERE'S ONLY HALF THE GLUCOS IN THE SODA BECAUSE THE OTHER HALF AS FRUCTOS SOEWEN TWENTY FIVE ON TWENTY FIVE SO YOUR GLUCOST RISE WON'T BE AS I YOUR GLUCOS EXCURSION WILL BE LOWER THIS IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THERE'S THIS THING COLD GLICEMIC INDEX  GLUSIMIC INDEX IS NORD IT'S GARBAGE IT IS COMPLETE N UTTER BS THE GLASY MIINDEX ABSOLUTE YES IT WILL NOTHING NOTHING IS MORE A A AGREGIOUS IN TERMS OF ARGUMENT THEN THEN THEN THE GLICIMC INDEX AND THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS DIETICIANS AS PROMOTE AN A SPOUSE ONE OF THE THINGS TA S CATAGO I YE OSN'T THIS IS AN IDEA THAT MUST DIE OI WE'LL GET BACK TO WHY THE GLIY MIC INDEX HAS GOT A DIE AH BUT SO SO THAT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY CALORIES AND ACTI CAN WE CAN WE MAKE THESE EQUAL JUSTS FORSAKEO OF SIMPLICITY CAN WE SAY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY CALORIES OF GLUCOS FROM THE BAGE VERS IS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY CALORIES OF FRUCTOS HOW DO WE GET TWO HNDRED FIFTY CALIES OF PURFROCTOS WE DON'T YOU CAN'T OK HE GOT TO BRING THE GLUCOS WE LAP LAB FROCTOS O'D HAV TO NI THEN LET'S TAY WIT OR YOURYO OUCHIS AT HALF GLUCOS HAFROTTHAI MEAN THERE IS NO FRUCTOS ALONE IN NATURE EVEN CRACKER SOME OF THE ONES THAT OUR SALTY ARE ALSO SWEET IF YOTOSI YA AA FR I FROTOS ON SERVICE YE THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO EAT JUST ONE NDEED AND OM SO WHAT'S HAPPENING BY OCHEMICALLY T AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE FRUCTOS COMPONENT SPECIFICALLY SO THE FRUCTOS WILL FIRST OF ALL GO INTO THE INTESTIN THE INTESTIN WILL MATABOLIZE SOME OF THAT FROCTOS THROUGH WHAT IS KNOWN AS INTESTINAL THE NOVAL IPOGENISIS ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF THAT FROCTOS WILL BE TURNED INTO FAT RIGHT IN THE INTESTIN THAT'S COS FRUCTOS IT TIS WANTS TO BE FAT EFRUCTOS ANCS TO BE FAT FRUCTOS IS THE LIPOGENIC SUBSTRAT HERE WERE NOT TIME ABOUT BODY FAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FAT MOLECULES THAT CAN POTENTIALLY BE USED AS ENERGY THAT'S RIGHT TRIGLISRIDE MOLICOC SO TSO TEN PER CENT OF TAT FRUCTOS WILL BE TURNED INTO TRIGLIS RTE RIGHT IN THE INTESTAN AND BE RELEASED INTO THE BLOOD STREAM AND IT IS THE REASON FOR A POST PRANDIAL TRIGLISURIDE RESPONSE AS NERANDIAL IS A AND I'M INCLUDING MYSELF IN THE SCRIP IS NURD SPEAK FOR AFTER EATING LOGIC TIMICALLY IT'S LONGE NSO THAT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE DRIVERS OF CARDIVASCULAR PYTHOLOGY THAT INTESTINAL DENOVAL IPOGENISIS TURNING THAT FRUCTOS INTO TRIGLIS RIDT RIGHT IN THE INTESTIN NW THERE'S A LIMIT TO HOW FAST AND HOW MUCH THE INTESTAN CAN DO THAT THE REST OFT FROCTOS WILL BE AABSORBED INTO THE PORTAL VANE BUT NOT BEFORE SOME OF THAT FROCTOS WILL MAKE IT FURTHER DOWN AND IT WILL NI TRATE TIGHT JUNCTION PROTINES TOCA PORTALVAN OF ACETNY SOTOVANGOS TO THE LIVER PORTOVANGOS FROM THE VICERA FROM THE INTESTIN TO THE LIVER TO CATIN DOESN'T OGETTING OCOLCUIN INTESTAN TO LIVER OC BUT FRUCTOS NITRATES TIGHT JUNCTION PROTIES  IM EXPLAIN THAT TO YOUR AUDIENCE YOUR INTESTIN IS A SUER DEFINITION F A SUR A PIPE WITH SHITNET E THAT'S ITS SUER AR INTESTNS OR SUERS THERE'S JUNK IN THE CENTER AND THE JOB OF THE INTESTIN IS TO MOVE THE JUNK THROUGH TO THE ANES ABSORBING THE GOOD STUFF WHY YOU CANT THE INTESTIN IS MADE UP OF CELLS INTESTINAL APITHELIAL CELS THAT ARE BOUND TOGETHER AND THEY ARE BOUND WITH PROTINES THAT BASICALLY FORM A BARRIER THOSE BARRIERS  OLL TIGHT JUNCTION PROTINES IS LIKE CLOUDIN N LIKE HOM ZONULAN IS THE NALY ONE CAY THER OTHERS BUT ZONULAN IS THE ONE THAT GOES IS DEFECTIVE IN CILIACTASIES WHAT DEFINES A TIGHT JUNCTION IS IT IS THA COMPLETELY IMPERMIABLE OR SAMUPERMIABLE COMPLETELY IMPERMIABLE UNLESS ITS FUNCTION IS INHIBITED TURNS OUT IF YOU ALTER THE A A FOSROLATION STATUS OR THE NITRATE STATUS OF THAT TIGHT JUNCTION IT WILL BECOME TRANSIENTLY PERMIABLE AND SO FRU TOST NI TRAITS TIGHT JUNCTION PROTINES CAUSING THEM TO BE TRANSIENTLY PERMIABLE ALLOWING SOME OF THE JUNK IN YOUR INTESTAN TO GET THROUGH INS YOUR BLOOD STREAM SO THIS IS LEAKI GUT THIS IS LEAKY GT THIS IS WHAT CAUSES LEAKY GUT FRUCTOST IS A DRIVER OF LEAKY GUT GOT IT THAT CAUSES INFLAMMATION AT THE LEVEL THE LIVER WHICH ULTIMATELY LEADS TO TO STEMIC INFLAMMATION ONE OF THE REASONS WHY HIGCENC ITY SEE OUR PITUT SINC TIVTY SEE OUR P IS HIGH IN PATIENTS WHO EAT ULTROPROCESS FOOD SEE AR P SE REACTIVE PROTINE WHICH IS A MARKER OF A SUMECHING INFLAMMATORY I MEAN RESPONSE EXACTLY YOU DON'T WANT IT TOO HIGH AND NINETY THREE PER CENT OF AMERICANS TO DAY ARE INFLAMED DOES I MEAN THE NINETY THREE PER CENT OF AMERICANS HAVE LEAKY GUTS YE IT DOES CAUSE THAT'S WHERE IT COMES FROM SO IN ADDITION TO LIMITING FRUCTOSIN TAKE WHAT ERE THINGS THAT O SUPPORT THE TIGHT JUNCTIONS OF THE INTESTINAL PATHWAY SO THERE'RE THREE BARRIERS IN YOUR INTESTIN TO KEEP THE JUNK WHERE IT BELONGS IN THE CENTR SO THAT IT CAN GET POOPED OUT THE YOU'RE BEHIND ITHREE SEPARATE BARRIERS ONE IS A PHYSICAL BARRIER CALLED THE MUSON LAYER SO'S A LAYER OF MUCUS THAT ACTUALLY SITS ON TOP OF THE INTESTALENT ATHELIAL SELVES NOW THAT MUSON IS A POLLY SACARIDE AND THE BACTERIA CAN USE THAT MUSON LAYER FOR ITS OWN PURPOSES IT WILL EAT YOUR MUSON LAYER IF YOU DON'T FEED YOUR BACTERIA YOU MUST FEED YOUR BACTERIA OR BACK YOUR BACTERIA WILL FEED ON YOU SO YOU ARE IN CONCERT WITH YOUR MICROBIUM IF YOU DEPRIVE YOUR MICROBIUM OF THE FOOD THAT IT NEEDS IT WILL USE YOU AS IT'S FOOD AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY FIBER IS SO IMPORTANT SO FIBER TO BUILD UP THIS MUSIN LAYER IS ONE WAY TO REINFORCE THE THE ON THE FENCETHAT THAT IS THE TIGHT JUNCTIONS ET CETERA EXON BETWEEN YOUR INTESTINEN IN THE BLOOD STREAM THIS RAISEIS AN INTERESTING POINT ABOUT FASTING A MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF DUE A SORT OF SUDO INTERMITTEN FASTING MAY YOU MY FIRST MEAL SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ELEVEN AND NEW AN ARE NOT STRICT ABOUT THIS THE ELEVEN VERSES NOWN THING AND PRALLY EAT MY LAST BYT OF FOOD SOMEWHERE ROUND EIGHT PM AND OCCASIONALLY EATS OUTSIDE THAT WINDOW I I'VE DONE THIS FOR A LONG TIME AT IS FEELS BEST TO ME ABT OTHER PEOPLE USE A SHORTER EATING WINDOW ONE THING THAT I LEARNED FROM A COLLEAGUE AT YALE THE STUDIES THE GOT MICROBIUM THAT WAS SURPRISING TO ME IS THAT WHEN YOU DO WHEN YOU EAT IN THAT WAY THERE'S A LONG STRETCH OF TIME SOMETIMES LONGER FOR PEOPLE THAT OF A SHORTER EATING WINDOW LONGER FASTING WINDOW THAT IS WHERE YOUR ACTALY EATING UP YOUR OWN INTESTINAL LINING SO THIS IDEA THAT FASTING IS SO GREAT FOR US ON THE ONE HAND MIGHT BE TRUE ON THE OTHER HAND YOU'R YOU'R ACTUALY CONSUMING COMPONENTS OF YOUR YOU'RE NOT FEEDING YOUR GOT MICROBIUM AND YOU TO PLEAD IT BUT THAT HERE'S WHERE I WAS A POSITIVELY SURPRISE WHEN YOU DO EAT PROVIDED THAT YOU EAT ENOUGH FIBR AND IN PRETULAR HIGH QUALLITY FOR MENTED FOODS LOCION AN FRMENTED FOOD IT SEEMS THAT THE THE LINING OF THE GOT AND THE GOT MICROBIUM IS REPLENISHED TO A LEVEL THAT IS GREATER THAN IF YOU HAD EATEN FOR LONGER PERIODS OF THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR CYCLE YET I HAVE THAT RIGHT WE  U O HAVE IT RIGHT AND I DON'T KNOW WHY THAT IS TRUE BUT IT DOES SEEM TO BE THE CASE AND FOR MENTED FOODS THEY IT PART BECAUSE THEYE GOT ALREADY SHORT CHAINE FATIASES IN THEM SEE THAT'S AN PREFERR FOOD OF THE MICROBINE WELL IT'S WHAT THE MICROBIUM ACTUALLY TURNS FIBR INTO SO IT'S PROBABLY HELPING YOU'RE INTESTINAL AT THE FELIAL SELVS IN THE SAME WAY WHAT THE MICROBIUM TURNING FIBR INTO SHORT CHAINE FADIAS ITSELPS SO IT'S WHAT WE CALL A POST BIOTIC SO YOU HAVE PREBIOTIC WHICH IS THE FOOD FOR THE BACTERIA YOU HAVE THE PROBIOTIC WHICH IS THE BACTERIA ITSELF THEY HAVE THE POSTBIOTIC WHICH IS WHAT THE BACTERIA MAKE IN ORDER TO HE'LL YOU GONOCA AND SO SHORT CHAINED FATIASES ARE POST BIOTICS AD THEREARE LOT OF PEOPLE SELLING SHORT CHAINED FATIACISS YOU KNO DRINKS AND SUPPLEMENTS N WHAT HAVING WHETHER THEY WORK OR NOT IS ANOTHER STORY IF I CONSUME FROTOS IN THE A FORM OF TETS SAY A HIGHLY PROCESS FOOD AS MINIMALANTIOCIDENDS BUT I'S GOT PLENTY CALORIES TYPICALLY AH  AND IT'S DESTRUPTING THE TI JUNCTIONS MAKING MY GOT LEAKY BUT I'M ALSO EATING FIBRE YOU ARM HAVING A YOU KNOW A MEAL THAT INCLUDES A SALAD OF HAVING GAVING SOME PROBOTICS AND THEN I WANTER LIKE A COUPLE RECIS PEIN A BUTTER CUPS LAY IN THE DART CHOCOLATE ONES IN PARTICULAR I DON'T DO THIS ANY MORE BUT I USED TO EAT LIKE THAT MORE OFTEN AS AS TIME AS GONE ON AT  BECOMES I DON'T LIKE TO CALL IT STRICTER BUT MORE I ITTEND TO LIKE HEALTHIER FOODS OVER TIME AND I THINK YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH DIFFERENT THINGS AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF LIFE ALTHOUGH YOU WORK WITH YOUNG PEOPLE SO  IG WILL GET TO VERY YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WILL GET TO THIS BUT HOW HOW MUCH DAMAGE MY DOING BY INJESTING ANY FORTOST IN THE FORM OF A HIGHLY PROCESS FOOD SO I'LL MAKE IT VERY SIMPLE ANDYOU I AM FOR DESSRT FOR DESSERT I AM NOT FOR DESERT FOR BREAKFAST LUNCH SNACKS IN DINNER SO IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A COUPLE OF REASIS PINOF BUTTER CUPS AS YOURE DESERT IN THE SAME WAY AS YOU MIGHT HAVE A CONIAC FOR DESERT THAT'S FINE I HAVE NO PROMLIT THAT THE QUESTION IS ARE YOU CAN TO EAT RESISPIN OF BUTTER CUPS FOR BREAKFAST NOT I DON'T EAT BREAKFAST WELL NO BY NICTA I  SEE YOUR POINT THE NATIONAL SCHOOL BREAKFAST PROGRAM WHICH TWENTY NINE PER CENT OF SCHOOL CHILDREN TO DAY CONSUME IS A BOLL OF FRUIT LOOPS IN A GLASS OF ORNGETES THAT IS FORTY ONE GRIMS OF SUGAR MERICAN HER ASSOCIATION SAYS THAT THE UPPER LIMIT FOR CHILDREN SHOULD BE TWELVE GRIMS OF ADDED UGAR PERDAY THAT'S FORTY ONE GRAMS OF ADDED SUGAR AND IT'S JUST BREAKFAST AND THAT'S FRUCTOS RICH TOTAL IT RIGHT COMPLETELY SO THE QUESTION IS WHICH DESERTER WE TALKA ABOUT IT AND RIGHT AND CAN WE CAN WE ADJUST THAT MORNING MEAL AM TO A DIFFERENT REALITY CAUSE I AGREE THAT THEREARE PLENTY OF KIDS EATING THAT OR A MUFFIN THAT MIGHT BE THE EQUIVALENT AND DO BUT WHAT ABOUT THE PARENT WHO SAYS LOCALY LET'S COME UP WITH A HEALTHIER OPTION THAT THE KID STILL LIKES LIKE A OTHINGYO ABACK TO MY CHILDHOOD I LIKE A HONEY NUTCHURIOS OR SOMETHING SO NOT FRUIT LOOPS WHICH IS KOND OF THE EXTREME AM TAKE A LOOK AT THE SIDE OF THE PACKIT NO DOUT FOR NOW LETS SAY THEY GO WITH AM SOME AKE WAFFLES THAT ARE MADE SO WITHOT WITHA PREMADE A MIX SOME MILKSOME BUTTER AM YOU KNOW ITSO MOM OR DAD IS MAKING WAFFLES GRAY IT SOUNDS HEALTHIER BUT THEN IF YOU DO THE BREAK DOWN O RESTILL ENDING UP IT VERY HIGH ARE WE BUS EATING DESERT FOR BREAKFAST AN WE  EGO WAFFLES OR WE M A MAKING WAFFLES A DE NOVO OU KNOW FROM SCRATCH IN YOUR OWN KITCHEN  LET'S SAY MAKE DIFFERENCE  BECAUSE THE EGGO WAFFLES YOU KNO REPLETE WITH SUGAR ON PURPOSE BECAUSE THE FOOD INSTRY KNOWS WHEN THEY ADD IT YOU BY MORE BECAUSE IT'S ADDICTIVE  AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE A A A DEMOGRAPHIC THE MECHANISTIC THE IMAGING AND ALSO THE ECONOMIC DATA TO DEMONSTRATE THAT SUGAR'S ADDICTIVE AND THE FOOD IN THE STREE KNOWS IT SO IVE YO EVER HEARD OF A PHENOMENON CALL PRICE ELASTICITY PRICE ELASTICITY IS AN ECONOMIC TERM THAT IS USED TO ASK THE QUESTION IF THE PRICE OF A GIVEN GOOD GOES UP BY ONE PER CENT THAT SHOULD RESULT IN REDUCTION IN PURCHASER CONSUMPTION BECAUSE PRICE INFLUENCES CONSUMPTION HOW MUCH DOES IT INFLUENCE IT SO IF IT'S IF SOMETHING'S PRICE ELASTIC WHEN THE PRICE GOES UP CONSUMPTION GOES DOWN EQUIVALENTLY A FOOD THAT IS PRICE ELASTIC THE MOST PRICE ELASTIC FOOD IS EGGS SO WHEN THE PRICE OF EGGS GOES UP ONE PER CENT CONSUMPTION OF EGGS GOES DOWN POINT SIX EIGHT PER CENT MEANING THAT EGGS HAVE A PRICE ELASTICITY OF POINT THREE TO GOT IT GOT IT NOW WHAT'S THE MOST PRICE ANYLASTIC FOOD THE TOP THREE MOST PRICE ANYLASTIC FOODS ARE FAST FOOD TEREAL POINT ATE ONE I LIKE A GOOD QUIZS AS FE POINT ATE ONE A A A SOF DRINKS AT POINT SEVEN NINE AND JUICE OF POINT SEVEN SEVEN MEANING PEOPLE WILL PAY NOT WHATEVER UT THEY'LL THEY'RE WILLING TO PAY MORE MORE MORE READILY WILLING TO PAY MORE BECAUSE OF THE SUGAR BECAUSE IT'S EDDICTIVE BECAUSE ITS HEDONIC SO MANY MANY YEARS AGO ANDE YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER SOMETHING CALLED CANSIAN ECONOMICS A CASION ECONOMICS WAS BASED ON THIS CONCEPT OF THE RATIONAL ACTOR AND THE RATIONAL ACT CAN DETERMINE VALUE WHICH IS UTILITY OVER COST AND IF YOUR A RATIONAL ACTOR YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SAY YET I'LL BUY THAT BUT I WON'T BUY THAT IIN MINETEEN SEVENTY NINE AND YOU'LL CANOMEN AND AMOSTERSKY N WELL PRIZE WHINR NOT DALCANMAN DESCRIBE THE IRRATIONAL ECTOR NOW THE IRRATIONAL ACTOR CANNOT DETERMINE VALUE AND THE REASON IS BECAUSE HE IS RISK OVERSE SO THE COST IS ALWAYS TOO GREAT SO UTILITY MAY BE THE SAME BUT THE CST GOES UP BECAUSE THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE YOU KNOW AVERSE IVE TENDENCIES IT THE IRRATIONAL ECTOR GEFFREY SACS HAS DESCRIBED THE HEDONIC ACTOR WHO ALSO CANNOT DETERMINE VALUE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT A COST THEY NEED THEIR FIC AND THIS IS WHAT'S GOING ON AND THE FOODANSTREE KNOWS IT AND THAT'S WHY EVERY FOOD IN THE STORE HAS BEEN SPIKED I LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BRAK TO ACKNOWLEDGE OUR SPONSOR ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTROELIKE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS ZERO SUGAR AND THE APPROPRIATE RATIOS OF THE ELECTROLIKE SODIUM MAGNASIUM AND PATASSIUM AND THAT CORRECT RATIO OF ELECTROLITES IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BECAUSE EVERY CELL IN YOUR BODY BUT ESPECIALLY YOUR NERVE CELLS YOUR NURONS RELIES ON ELECTROLITES IN ORDER TO FUNCTION PROPERLY SO WHEN YOUR WELL HYDRATED AND YOU HAVE THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF ELECTROLITES IN YOUR SYSTEM YOUR MENTAL FUNCTIONING AND YOUR PHYSICAL FUNCTIONIN IS IMPROVED I DRINK ONE PACKET OF ELEMENT DISSOLVED IN ABOUT SIXTEEN TO THIRTY TWO OUNCES OF WATER WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AS WELL AS WHILE I EXERCISE AND IF I'VE SWEAT ELECTURING THAT EXERCISE I OFTEN WILL DRINK A THIRD ELEMENT PACKET DISSOLVED IN ABOUT THIRTY TWO OUNCES OF WATER AFTER I EXERCISE ELEMENT COMES IN A VARIETY OF DITFEREM FLAVORS ALL OF WHICH I FIND REALLY TASTY I LIKE THE CITRISTS I LIKE THE WATER MELONI LIKE THE RASBERRY FRANKLY I CAN'T PICK JUST ONE IT ALSO COMES IN CHOCOLATE AND CHOCOLATE MEN WHICH I FIND TASTE BEST IF THEY ARE PUT INTO WATER DISSOLVED AND THEN HEATED UP I TEND TO DO THAT IN THE WINTER MONTHS BECAUSE OF COURSE YOU DON'T JUST NEED HYDRATION ON HOT DAYS AND IN THE SUMMER AND SPRING MONTHS BUT ALSO IN THE WINTER WHEN THE TEMPERATURES ARE COLD AND THE ENVIRONMENT TENDS TO BE DRY IF YOU LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT SPELLED ELEMENTI DOCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO TRY A FREE SAMPLE PACK AGAIN THATS DRINK ELEMENT DOCOM SLASH HUBERMEN DOCTMA DESERVE FOR BREAKFAST IN THE FORM OF SEREALS YET SOME OF WHICH ARE IM DISGUISED WOR COUCHED AS HEL THEER YOU KNOW I THINK OF VACONNING NOT TURIOS IT SEEMS HEALTHIER THAN FRUIT LUSES ITS LOOKS HEALTH YOU'RE LIKE THE CUT JUST BY WAY OF COLOR IT LOOKS CAN A WEETY YOU KNOW COLOR SO BUT LET AND IN TERMS OF LUNCH MEAN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I LOVE ABOUT EUROPE IS THAT THE BREADS ARE AMAZING YEPREISN'T TERRIFIC AND I A AND I LIKE THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT AS SWEET EXACTLY AND SO A SANDWHICH FROM NOT EVERY DELLY BUT FROM A TYPICAL SAND WHIT SHOP OR THAT ONE MAKES WITH STOREBOUGHT BREAD SLICED BREAD IN THE YOUAS HAS A LOT OF FRUTOS I LOOK DO TI LOOK THE UP PRIOR TO DO THAT DISCUSSION TO DAY SO IN SOME WAYS DESERT IS BEING WOVEN INTO FOODS THAT ARE THAT PARENTS AND OR KIDS EVERYONE THINKS OUR SAVORY ART RATHLY ETING SWEET EXACTLY RIGHT BUT WE CANT BUT WE DON'T TASTE THEM AS SWEET AT A CONSCIOUS LEVEL NECESSARILY REDA BUT OUR TASTEBUDS DO RIGHT THAT'S EXACTLY RIT SO THE QUESTION IS WHY DO THEY DO THAT SO QUESTION FOR YOUR OUDIENCE YOU BUY A LOAF OF BREAD AT THE LOCAL BAKERY HOW SOON BEFORIT STALES TWO DAYS ATAST YE IF IT'S REALLY GREAT BREAD THAT'S RIGHT ANTHE BETTER THE BREAD THE QUICKER IT STALES YOU BUY A LOAF OF BREAD AT THE A NEIGHBOURHOOD GROCERY STORE HOW SOON BEFORIT STALES A YOU'VE GOT PROBABLY A WEEK AND THEN THERE'S A THE MOULDY PIECES AT THE END A TRUT THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE IN COLLEGE IN YOUR MEATRNS AH WHAT CAN LAST UP TO THREE WEEKS DEPENDENT RIGHT YOU COULD THROW IT IN THE FREEZE ARE YIF I DO THAT WITH THE BAKERY BREAD BUT IT'S NEVER THE SAME NEVERTHE SESS NEVERISIN SO THE QUESTION IS WHY IS THAT THE ANSWER IS SUGAR THE ANSWER IS SUGAR SO THE GROCERY STORE BREAD HAD SUGAR ADDED TO IT ON PURPOSE BECAUSE WHEN YOU BAKE IT THE SUGAR DOES NOT EVAPORATE IT STAYS IN THE BREAD AND THE SUGAR'S HYGROSCOPIC MEANING IT HOLDS ON TO WATER SIS A PHENOMENON THAT THE FOOD IN THE STREE USES COLD WATER ACTIVITY AND SO IT WILL HOLD ON TO WATER AND SO IT WILL STAY SPONGY IT WILL NOT STALE AS QUICKLY AS THE BAKERY STOREBREAD WHICH DID NOT HAVE THAT SUGAR ADDED TO IT SO EVEN SOMETHING AS BENIN AS BREAD HAS BEEN TURNED IN TO SOMETHING THAT ULTIMATELY LEADS TO CHRONIC METABLE OCDISEASE WE'VE PIVOTED SOMEWHAT FROM CARBO HYDRATE DIVIDED INTO GLOGLUCOS AND FRUCTOS TO DISCUSSION OF SUGAR CAN YOU TE ST THE LINK BETWEEN SUGAR AND FRUCTOSTS SO TABLE SUGAR WHAT PERCENTAGE OF TABLE SUGAR IS FRUCTOS WHAT PERCENTAGE OF BROWN SUGAR IS FRUCTOS WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE SUGAR THAT'S ADDED TO FOOD IS HIFROCTS CORNS ARE ON AVERAGE YOU KNOW JUST BECAUSE HEAR WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS IT AM WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING AS AN INTENTIONAL LACING OF FOOD AND  WIS SOMETHING THAT'S A DICTIVE BUT THAT'S ALSO PROCESS VERY DIFFERENTLY AT THE LEVEL THE KIDNEY AT THE LEVEL OF THE LIVER OM AND IT'S BAT IT'S A TATS IT'S A BAD SITUATION A SO SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SUGAR I THINK WE NEED TO BE AS CAREFUL IN DESCRIBING WHAT WE REALLY MEAN AS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A CALORY I COMPLETE LIGRE SO LET FOR YOUR AUDIENCE LET'S BE VERY VERY CLEAR ON DEFINITIONS LET'S NOT USE THE WORD SUGAR BECAUSE IT HAS MULTIPL DEFINITIONS LET'S USE SUKROS SUKROS IS WHAT YOU PUT YOUR COFFEE IT'S THE CRYSTALS IT'S CANESUGAR BEACH SUGAR YOU KNOW YOU KNOW THE STUFF THAT YOU TEASPOONS OF RIGHT THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS AVAILABLE FOR MANY MANY YEARS THAT IS ONE MOLECULEGLUCOS ONE MOLECULE OF FROCTOS BOUND TOGETHER FOR THE CHEMIS OUT THERE AN OGLIKE A CITIC LINCAGE THE ENDSIM IN YOUR INTEST AND CALLED SUKRACE CLEAVES THIS OGLIKEA CITIC LINCAGE IN ABOUT A NANOSECOND YOU ABSORB THE TUMOLECULES SEPARATELY THE GLUKOS GOES TO THE ENTIRE BODY GENERYS AN INSLEN RESPONSE THE FROCTOS GOES STRAIGHT TO YOUR LIVER GENERATES FAT THAT'S SUKROS HEYFRACTOS CORNSYRP IS ESSENTIALLY ONE MOLECULGLUCOS ONE MOLECULE O FROCTOS NOT BOUND TOGETHER NO OGLIKE A CITIC LINCAGE SO THEY'RE FREE THE ENZIN SUKRES DOESN'T CARE AS THE BLONDS ALREADY BROKEN ULTIMATELY THEY DO THE SAME THING AND THAT'S WHY HYFRATOS CORNSYRP AND SUKROS ARE INDISTINGUISHABLE METABOLICALLY WHAT THEY ARE IS THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT ECONOMICALLY AND THE REASON IS BECAUSE HYFRACTOS CORNSERPS HALF THE PRICE OF SUKROS BECAUSE SUKROS WE GET FROM IMPORTING AND HYFRCHTOS CORNSRP WE MAKE AT HOME SUKROS IS IN BAGS HYFRACHTOS CORNSERP IS IN BARRELS SUKROS YOU CAN SELL AT THE STORE HYFROCTOS CORNSYRP YOU SELL TO THE IU K ULTROCROSESS FOOD MANUFACTURER YOU CAN'T BUY HYFRTOS CORNSERP AT THE YOU KNOW AT THE GROCERY STORE SO THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY'RE USED FOR HYFRCHTOS CORNSEURP IS PARTICULARLY GREEGIOUS BECAUSE IT'S SO MISSIBLE BECAUSE IT'S OLREADY A LIQUID SO YOU'VE PROBABLY REMEMBER CHIPSOHOI COOKIES IN THE OLD DAYS THEY WOULD OFTEN WOULD SEEM LIKE THE SUGAR IN THE A COOKY HAD CRYSTALLIZED CAUSE THE SUGAR CONTENT WAS SO HIGH IT'S BEEN WILL SINCE I'VE HAD ONE THAT THEY WEREN'T PARTICULARLY GOOD YET WEL NOW BUT YOU EAT TWO OF THEM AND THEN YOU THINK THEY'RE GOOD AND ANYONEY EAT FOR YHE AT'S WHEN TOUH AD THE FIRST BODY IS IN ILIKE THE AND THEN IT'S BOMS AWAY THERE YOU GO BELL NOW IT'S TUECHIPS OF WI COOKIES I REME REASONSP MTUICH THAT'S HIFORKTOS CORNSER BECAUSE BECAUSE THE TWO MOLECULES ARE FREE THEY DON'T CRYSTALLIZE SO CAN ACTUALLY UP THE DOSE SEVERAL TIMES THROUGHOUT TO DAY'S DISCUSSION YOU'VE  TALKING ABOUT THE CORTOCOT FOOD INDUSTRY CASE SO I'M NOT A CONSPIRACY THEORIS BUT I NOW BUT I UNDERSTAND UM YOU KNOW THAT MOST BUSINESSES EXIST TO MAKE MONEY MANY BUSINESSES START OFF WITH GOOD INTENTIONS AND DRIFT IN ORDER TO STAY IM TO STAY COMPETITIVE I AND MANY MANY BUSINESSES AS WE KNOW IM NOT ALL OF WHICH ARE ENTIRELY BAD SUCH IS THE FARMER SUITABLE INDUSTRY I YOU THEYRE BAD THEY'RE INCANCES OF LIKE THE OP YOD CRISIS BUT THEN THERE ARE DRUGS FROM THE FHARMICICAL INDUSTRY THAT HELP SAVE LIVES I MEAN THAT'S MY MY STANDS IM THE FOOD INDUSTRY I THINK THEY'RE GOOD ACTORS AND THEY ARE BAD ACTORS BUT WHERE TINE ABOUT THE FOOD INDUSTRY Y WHET WE DIE ABOUT THE EXERCISE INDUSTRY WE DOE ABOUT THE PODCASS INDUSTRY AND MN YOU GOT GOOD ACTORS AND BAD ACTORS BUT WHAT YOU'VE ALLUDED TO SEVERAL TIMES HERE AND YOU'RE MORE INFORM THAN I AM IS A A A CONCERTED EFFORT TO LACE FOOD WITH A FORM OF SUGAR THAT MAKES PEOPLE CRAVE MORE OF THAT FOOD AND THAT IS CAUSING METABOLIC ILLNESS DISRUPTING META CONDRY A AND ON AND ON EXACTLY AND YOU'RE THE PHYSICIAN NOT ME IM YOU'VE WORKED WITH PATIENTS OR STRUGGLE WITH OBCITY AND FOR VARIOUS REASONS  NOT ME AND IM SO WE COULD PROBABLY SPEND HOURS IF NOT DAYS TALKING ABOUT ALL THE TERRIBLE THINGS THAT THE CORGOF FOOD INDUSTRY IS DONE BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THAT THE PURE MODEIVATION RIGHT I DON'T THINK THAT THEY WANT PEOPLE TO BE SICK BUT THEY WANT A SELL PRODUCT AND THIS SELLS MORE PRODUCT SO THEN IT RAISES TWO QUESTIONS IF WHY IS IT THAT MORE PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT KNOW THIS INFORMATION ALTHOUGH MANY MORE WELL KNOW AFTER TAS CONVERSATION BUT AND CERTAINLY IN GOVERNMENT IT'S A MEX REGARDLESS OF WHAT SIDE OF THE ISLE YOUR HONOR IF YOU'RE RIGHT IN BETWEEN THEY'RE THEY'RE CLEARLY PEOPLE THAT CARE ABOUT THE HEALTH OF THEMSELVES AND OTHERS SO I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW THINGS MIGHT HAVE GOT INTO THIS POINT BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK OR THE BARRIERS TO GETTING PEOPLE TO APPRECIATE JUST WHAT A PROBLEM THIS IS AND AND GETTING PEOPLE TO CHANGE THEIR CHOICES IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT THEY'RE EATING ARE THEY TRULY ADDICTED TO THE POINT WHERE THEY ARE SICK THEY CAN'T MAKE GOOD DECISIONS LIKE A LIKE A DRUG ATICTUDES HIGHLY ADDICTED TO HEROINE IS A SICK PERSON THEY HAVE AN ILLNESS AND THEY NEED TREATMENT BUT UNTIL THEY GET THAT TREATMENT THEY CAN'T MAKE GOOD DECISIONS LET'S TAKE AN ANALOGY ALCO FORTY PER CENT OMERICANS  TEATOTALRS NEVER TOUCH A STUFF FORTY PER CENT OF WIDPER CENT DON'T GREAT I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF ALCOL I'VE NEVER SEEN IT MAKE ANYONE BETTER AT ANYTHING THAN REALLY MATTER NO BECAUSE THAT'S DRINKING IT'S ANOW US O ROIMPLETELY VASTIDULE THERE'S NO A BY CHEMICAL REACTION IN THE BODY IT REQUIRES ALCHOLL FOR THE SAME REASON BY WIFROCTOVS A FORTY PER CENT OF SOCIAL DRINKERS I CAN PICK UP A BUR PUT IT DOWN I'M IN THAT CATEGORY TEN PER CENT OR BENS DRINKERS AND TEN PER CENT OF CHRONIC ELCOHOLICS NOW DO YOU DEPRIVE THE FORTY PER CENT OF SOCIAL DRINKERS BECAUSE OF THE TWENTY PER CENT OF BENS DRINKERS AN CHRONIC ELCOLICS I BELY NOT EOPLE SHOULD BE IN CHOICE BUT I BELIEVE PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING SO THAT THEY CAN BE IN CHOICE WELL RIGHT LIKE DO AS YOU I WOULD SAY AND I SAID THIS ABOUT THE ALCALL EPISODE WHICH TURN OUT TO BE ONE OF OUR MOST PROLIFIC EPISODES WHERE I SAID THE NO MORE THAN TWO DRINKS IS THE ROWS BETTER THAN ANY AND MORE THAN TWO DRINKS PER WEEK IT YOU NEED TO DO OTHER THINGS TO OFFSET THAT AND ITS PROBLEMATIC THATS WHAT NOWSE OR WHAT THEY DAY TO SAY BUT I BUT I WOULD THEY DO AS YOU WANT BUT KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING WELL SO I WOULD SAY THAT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE FOOD IN THE STRE WANTS YOU TO THINK THAT'S THAT IS THE FOOD INDUSTRIES MONTRA IS YOF YOUR OWN CHOICE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY SO THE QUESTION IS IS PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY WORK THANSWERS KNOW IT DOESN'T EVERY A PUBLIC HEALTH TOBACCO IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND STARTED OUT AS A PERSONAL HEALTH AS YUE BEBEFORE BECAME A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND YOU CAN PICT YOUR A YOU PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY ISSUE WHETHER IT BE EXPOSURES WHETHER IT TE ADDICTIONS WHETHER I THE INFECTIONS BOTTOM LINE IS ULTIMATELY IT REQUIRED A SOCIETAL RESPONSE WE CAN TALK ABOUT SYPHILIS WE CAN TALK ABOUT TO BIRCULOSIS ULTIMATELY NEEDED A PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE WE CAN TALK ABOUT  A TEEN PREGNANCY WE CAN TALK ABOUT TOBACCO TOBACCO ULTIMATELY NEEDS A PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE BECAUSE THE SHEER ENORMITY OF IT AND THE A THE AGRIEGIOUSNESS OF IT REQUIRES THAT PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE WELL TURNS OUT THIS IS NO DIFFERENT IN ORDER TO EXERCISE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOUR CRITERIA HAVE TO BE MET THOSE FOUR CRITERIA ARE THE FOLLOWING NUMBER ONE KNOWLEDGE YEF DOES THE KNOWLEDGE BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE AND HOW CAN YOU EXERCISE PERSONA RESPONSIBILITY WELL IN FACT THE PUBLICS BEING KEPT FROM THE KNOWLEDGE WE'RE DOING THIS NOW IN PART TO IN YOU KNOW TO IN TRAIN THAT KNOWLEDGE TO TO GET PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PROBLEM IS YE  I CONSIDER MYSELF PRETTY INFORMED ABOUT NUTRITION AND HEALTH BUT A ALREADY TO DAY I'VE LEARNED TWO DOES IN FACTS ABOUT PROCESSING A FROTES IN COLOR CALORIES GENERALLY THAT I HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF PRIOR  THAT'S GOOD O K CAUSE IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MASSH IT'S ABOUT THE SCIENCE E THEY WANTED TO BE ABOUT CALORIES SO WE HAVE THIS THING CALL FOOD SCIENCE WE HAVE THIS THING COLLD NUTRITION AND WE HAVE THIS THING COLD METABOLIC HELTH THEY ARE NOT THE SAME FOOD SCIENCE IS WHAT HAPPENS TO FOOD BETWEEN THE GROUND AN THE MOUTH NUTRICIAN IS WHAT HAPPENS TO FOOD BETWEEN THE MOUTH AND THE CELL METABOLIC HEALTH IS WHAT HAPPENS TO FOOD INSIDE THE CELL BUT ALL THE CHRONIC DISEASES THAT WE ARE SUFFERING FROM TYPE YOU DIBEDIS I PRETENTION TISLIP A DEMIACARTY OF ASK AS THESE CANS WER DIMENTIO FAT DELIVER DISEASE PICISTICAL VERIAN DISEASE THOSE EIGHT DISEASES WHICH MAKE UP SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURES IN THES COUNTRY TO DAY ARE ALL INSIDE THE CELL BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL MITICONDRIAL TE FUNCTION AND THERE IS NO MEDICINE THAT GETS TO THE MITA COUNTRY ALTHOUGH YOU AND OTHERS AT STANFORD HARVARD ET CETERA ARE STARTING THIS WITH METABOLIC PSYCHIETRY BEING ONE INSTANCE RI INDAND YOU SEE US ALF AS WELL FOR AVI A GEN ENYOUS YES OYOU YOUARE HOME INSTITUTION WONDERFUL INSTITUTION READ UP THE ROAD FROM SANFORD SO YONT THINGS ARE CHANGING PEOPLE ARE STRING TO THINK ABOUT MYTA CONDRA THEY ARE O I SAY YOU LISS OFF THE FIRST THE FIRST THING YEU SAID THERE FOUR THINGS THAT STAND A BERY FIRST ONE WAS IN ALL NAGE O SECOND ACCESS CAUSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS THAN HOW CAN YOU EXERCISE PERSON RESPONSIBILITIES ACCESS TO HEALTHIER ALTERNATIVES EXACTLY WHICH MEANS COST IFIT IMEN I LOVE BURIES FROM THE FARMERS MARKET MORE THAN LEVE BERRIES FROM THE STORE I LOVE THE FARMERS MARKETS GENERALLY BE TAKES TIME ENERGY TO GO THERE AND THE COST IS ACTUALLY LOWER AT THE LEVEL OF WHAT YOU HAND THE VENDER TYPICALLY BUT A VOLUME IS TOUGH TO ACHIEVE THEY ACHALLY HAVE ME AT A AT A QUOTA A'R NOT ALLOWED TO BUY AS MANY BERRIES AS I WANT AT IS THE IVE SITO OF THE PEOPLE WANT RY YES SO THERE'S THAT RIGHT PEOPLE HAVE TO FEED THEIR FAMILY THAT YOU KNOW AND WELL WHAT WERE USED TO EATING A LOT OF VOLUME BUT YOU'RE ABLE TO AT LEAST GO THERE SOMETIMES  WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN QUOTE FOOD DESERTS WEALS TO TALK ABOUT PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN FOOD SWAMPS WHEN TONGE BAT FOOD SWAMPS WERE NOT TALKING ABOUT AND PLETHERA OF HEALTHY FOODS WERE TALKING ABOUT ALL THE JUNK THAT'S WHAT THEY LIVE IN THE SWAMP OF JUNK SO IF YOU LIVE IN THE SWAMP OF JUNK HOW ARE YOU SUPPOST EXERCISE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY NUMBER THREE AOR FORDABILITY SO YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO FORGEUR CHOICE AND SOCIETY HAS TO BE ABLE TO FORGYEUR CHOICE AND RIGHT NOW WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT CHOICE BECAUS HEALTH CARE CAUS RIGHT NOW ARE AT FOUR POINT ONE SHRILLION DOLLARS A YEAR BUT LIKE SO MANY THINGS IN A BEHAVIOUR ALL ECONOMICS AND HEALTH IT'S SO HARD FOR PEOPLE TO SEE THAT THE THE IMMEDIATE CHOICE IS LEADING TO A HIGHER COST ON THE ROAD THERE JUST TOO MANY NODES OF SEPARATION FOR PEOPLE HA REALIZE AY WHEN I'M REACHING FOR THIS SERIAL AS OPPOSED TO MAKING WAWFLES FOR MY KIDS FROM SCRATCH OR YOU KNOW THEY'RE THINKING TIME EFFICIENCY COST UFFICIENCY VOLUME THE KID'S NOT THROWING CANTRUMSCAUSE THEY'RE NOT NO LONGER GETTING THE SERIAL AND IT'S IT VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE THIS IS THE REASON WHY HEALTH CARE COSTS OR GOING OUP THEY'RE JUST TOO MANY NOTES OF SEPARATION COULDN'T AGREE MORE BUT HEULTIMATELY IT'S BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT SEPARATES AN SILOES A FOOD IN THE STRE PROFITS FROM HEALTH CARECOSTS IF YOU ACTUALLY COMBINE THOSE BECAUSE THEY ALLTLL BE ARE THE SAME YOU WOULD SEE THE PROBEM SO GLOBILY THE FOOD IN THE STRE GROSES NINE SRILLION DOLLARS A YEAR HEALTH CARE CST GLOBILY COST ELEVEN TRILLION DOLLARS A YEAR DIETARY RELATED HEALTH CARECOSTS ENVIRON MENTAL COSTS COST SEVEN TRILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND PRODUCTIVITY COSTS OST ONE SRILLION DOLLARS YEAR SO WHEN YOU DO THE MASS NINE MINEUSTS ELEVEN MINUS SEVEN MINUS ONE MEANS THAT THERE IS A TEN SHRILLION DOLLAR A YEAR DEFASIT BECAUSE OF OST CLEANING UP THE MESS OF THE FOOD IN THE STREET MAKES AND WHILE NUMBERS TAT AT NOT AFFORDABLE RIGHT I AGREE IN WHILE NUMBERS LIKE THAT LAND REALLY HARD I FIND THAT FOR MYSELF AND FOR MANY PEOPLE STATISTICS LIKE THAT ARE HARD TO KEEP IN MIND IN A WAY THIT'S ONLING ABOUT THE HUMAN BRAIN THAT HEARS THAT AND GOES WO WHERE LIKE THAT WAR COSTS THAT  MUCH AND THIS FOOD ISSUE COSTS THAT MUCH AND THEN WE GO TO THE STORE AND WERE HUNGRY AND THE KIDS ARE AR ARE ARE HUNGRY AND AND YOUR AND SO THOSE NOTES OF SEPARATION ITS IT'S ALMOST LIKE A NURL SLASH MEMORY SLASH PREFRONT OL QUARTEX ISSUE TO ME AND OF COURSE I LOOK AT EVERYTHING THROUGH THE LANDS OF NER BIOLOGYUTOO YOU KNOW NOT EVERYTHNG BUT MOST EVERYTHING AND SO HOW HOW COULD I NOT HOW COULD WE NOT BUT THEN THE THE ISSUE IS WELLTHERE STILL FOOD ON THE SHELVES AND YOU KNOW AND SO IT'S VERY  WHAT DO WE DO TO CONNECT IT'S AT BRILN CLOSER TOGETHER THESE NOE SO ACH ON IS I THE GOVERNMENT USO THE QUESTION IS IS THEIR FOOD ON THE SHELVES LET ME FINISH THE FOURTH ONE AND THEN I WANT TO COME BACK TO THAT POINT LET ME JUST  FINISH A CONEPT SO AFORTABILITY AND NUMBER FOR EXTERNALITIES YOUR CHOICE CAN'T HURT ANYBODY ELSE BUT WHAT IF YOUR CHOICE DOES HUART SOMEBODY ELSE SO LIKE FOR TOBACCO SECOND HIND SMOKE RT FOR ALCOO DRUNK DRIVING BUT WHAT'S THE ARGUMENT FOR TEEIN PREGNANCY THAT SOMEONE ELSE WAS GET AF TO RAISE THE KIDS EXACTLY BUT WHAT ABOUT FOR FOOD WELL HOW ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOUR EMPLOYER STAND FOR UNIVERSITY HAS TO PAY TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS A PER YEAR IN OBICITY RELATED HEALTH CARE EXPENSES THAT THEY HAVE PASSED ON TO YOU EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE NOT OBEES DTHAT IS AFFECTING YOU SO THAT GUIS OBE CITY RIGHT THERE THAT IS EFFECTING YOU A BUT THERE NOWADAYS IT'S ESPECIALLY TRICKY EVEN TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION I'M WILLING TO HAVE IT NOW WHICH IS THAT ES HAV IT THERE'S THIS WHOLE CONCEPT OF FAT SHAMING RIGHTS O SOMEBODY'S OBES WHOSE FAULT IS IT AND IF WE EVEN TALK ABOUT IT IS A ARE WE SUBJECT TO A ATTACK LEGITIMATE ATTACK YOU KNOW IT SO LET U SO CALLING SOMETHING  OH SOME ONE OBES AT A CLINICAL LEVEL IK EVING YERE YOU'RE AN EXPERT IN DON'T IT TALK CLOTY DON'T TALK ABOUT OBICITY LET'S TALK ABOUT DIOBEDIES O CASE IT TALK DIFFERENT CONSEQUENCE OF O BE CITY YET LET'S TALK ABOUT THE METABOLIC HEALTH ISSUE ITSELF THE FACT IS THAT TIOBEDIES IS NOW ELEVEN POINT FOUR PER CENT OF AMERICA WHAT WAS IT TWENTY YEARS AGO IT WAS IT'S TWENTY YEARS AGO IT WAS ABOUT EIGHT PER CENT I WAS WONDERING THIS EARLIER TWENTY YEARS AGO THERE WAS A LOT MORE MARJORIN AND REFRIGERATORS BUT PEOPLE WERE THINNER AND THERE WAS LESS DIOBEDIES EVERYHING HE TALL US ABOUT MARJYRIN AND TRANSFATS IS THAT 'S BAD BAD BAD NOW BUTTER IS BACK AS TIME MAGAZINE AND YOU SAID RIGHT SO CLEARLY CAN'T BE THE TRANSITION AWAY FROM TRANSFASS THAT'S INCREASE O BE CITY O NO NO SO IT'S CON BE THE INCREASE IN SUGAR AND THE INCREASEINSR IN ENDIES HIDDEN SUGARS ND EXACTLY THAT'S RIGHT I TTHE THE KEYTHO IS TACKA STAN IN INDIA BECAUSE THA AND CHINA THEY ARE NOT THAT BUT THEY HAVE FOURTEEN PER CENT DIOBEDIS RATES AND THE THIN THE REASON IS BECAUSE OF ULTRIPROSES FOOD ARE THERE ANY COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD THAT DON'T ALLOW HYPROCHTOS CORN SIR BOR AT LEAST NOT AT THE LEVEL THAT THAT WE DO OH THE FRLOTLOADS  THERE'LL BOAT LOADS OF COUNTRIES THAT A DON'T IMPORT HYROCHTOSCORN SURPOR DON'T MAKE IT SO I SCAN ANAVIAN COUNTRIE CAND THE NAVIAN COUNTRIES MOST OF EUROPE A THE OTHER THAN THE AGE OF PACIFIC RIM SO A JAPAN HAS IT FACTAS INVENTED IN JAPAN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX SOGAMEDICAL S SCHOOL TALK A SAKI AT ALL A A CAREA HAS IT A BUT AUSTRALIA DOES NOT HAVE IT TILAND DOES NOT HAVE IT BUT THEY HAVE JUST AS MUCH OF AN A OBECITY IN DIOBEDIES PROBLEM AS WE DO BECAUSE THEY'VE SUCROS BECAUSE HYFOOK TO SCOINSURPEND SUCROS OR NO DIFFERENT METABOLICALLY SO IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER THAT ONE TO ONE IT'S FE ONE TO ONE THING EXAVLY OF UCOSANFRTA SO HERE IS THE QUESTION ANSERED ISI ONE OF GO BACK TO THAT YOU SAID ALL THIS FOOD IS STILL ON THE SHELVES IS IT FOOD WHAT IS THE DEFINITION OF FOOD CAN IT GIVE THE DEFINITION I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD GIVE THIT'S NOT OTHER THA ONE I WOULD I WOULD GIVE BUT A SOMETHING THAT HAS C CONTAINS CLORIC ENERGY RE LIKE I I COULD EAT THIS MICROPHONE AMBUT IT'S NOT UNAPROVIDE MUCH USEFUL ENERGY THE DEFINITION OF FOOD STRAIGHT FROM THE DICTIONARY I BELIEVE ME I LOOKED IT UP AND MEMORIZED IT I BELIEVESUBSTRAIGHT THAT CONTRIBUTES TO EITHER GROWTH OR BURNING OF AN ORGANISM INTERESTING THAT IS THE DEFINITION OF TEVERY SCIENTIFIC ONE HUNDRED PER CENT CORRECT GROWTH OR BURNING SO ANY SUBSTRAT THAT PASSES YOUR LIPS THAT CONTRIBUTES TO EITHER GROWTH OR BURNING THAT'S FOOD WHO CAN LET'S DO IT LETS DO BURNING FIRST I JUST SHOWED YOU THAT SUGAR WHICH IS THE MORKER OF ULTRAPROCESS FOOD AND SEVENTY THREE PER CENT OF THEITEMS IN THE GROCERY STORE ARE SPITED WITH SUGAR INHIBITS BURNING IT INHIBITS THOSE THREE ENDSIMES INVOLVED IN MYHT A CONJURIAL FUNCTION NOW IT'S DO GROWTH MY COLLEAGUE DOCTOR EFROT MONSINEGO OR NON WHO IS THE CHAIRMEN OF NUTRITION AT HEBR UNIVERSAY JERUSALEM ACTUALLY LOOKED AT THIS QUESTION AND SHOWED THAT ULTRAPROSSES FOOD ACTUALLY IN HIBITS GROWTH IT INHIBITS CORTICAL BON GROWTH IT INHIBITS A TRIBECULAR BONE GROWTH IT HIBITS A CANCILLOR SPONE GROWTH IT HIBITS LINEAR BON GROWTH IT HIGH JACKS GROWTH FOR CAN SIR BECAUSE IT INHIBITS MIT A CONTRY AND SO YOU HAVE TO THEN GROW INSTEAD OF BURN AND THIS WAS WORK THAT WAS DONE IN IN VIVO OR IN VITRO IN VIVO INVEVOTS TO THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE EATING HIGH AMOUNTS OF HIGHLY PROCESS EXACTLY HOW DID HE FIND THOSEIN THE IN THE MDLEAST THAT THEYE FOUND IN ISRAEL THEY FOUND SO BOTTOM LINE IS IF A SUBSTRAIT DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE TO GROWTH AND DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE TO BURNING IS IT OF FOOD I SEE ANSER IS NOW WELL THAT'S SEVENTY THREE PERCENT OF WHATS IN THE GROCERY STORE SO I WOULD ARGUE YOU SAID THE FOODS THERE NOW IT'S NOT THAT'S NOT FOOD IN FACT IT'S CONSUMABLE POISON SO THIS LEADS TO AN IMPORTANT QUESTION OF WHAT'S LAUHED READ YOU REMOVE ALL THAT WHAT'S LAUGET IM JUST ANECDOTALLY AND WHAT I SOMETIMES CALL ANECDATA IM AND I'VE HAD SEVERAL FRIENDS IN THERE FORTIES AND EARLY FIFTIES SAY THEY WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT AND GET IN SHAPE AND THAT THE THING THAT'S WORKED EVERY EVERY SINGLE TIME FOR THEM TO LOSE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF WEIGHT QUICKLY AND KEEP IT OFF AND MANY OF THEM WERE ALREADY EXERCISING BUT THEN ALSO INCREASE OIR EXERCISE WAS I JUST SINCE I'M NOT A DITICIAN NUTRITIONIS OR ANYTHING I JUST SAY EAT MEAT FISH EGGS VEGETABLES FRUITS YOU'RE NOCK IN TO EAT STARCHES YOU'RE NOCK IN A DRINK OU CALL YOU'RE NOCK IN A DRINK SODA YOU CAN STILL HAVE COFFEE T YOU CAN STILL HAVE ARTIFICIAL SWEET NERS I WILL  GET TO ARTIFICIALS N YEAS AN WI BEWE WE HAVE TO GO THAT I'M AND THE REASON I SAY NO STARCHES EVEN THOUGH I PERSONALLY EAT RICE OP MEAL POSS O THINGS THAT SORT SOME IN IN MODERATION DEPENDING ON ON WHAT SOR T OF EXERCISE IND OM DOING IN HOW MUCH IS BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT NOWADAYS MANY THOSE THINGS CONTAIN CHFROCTOS AND INEVITABLY EVERY ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE IS BLOWN AWAY BY THE FACT THAT IT QUOTIN QUO WORKS AND AS SOON AS THAT'S ALL BECAUSE OF REDUCED CALORY AND TAKE OVER ALL NO AND THEY LOSE LIKE ANYWHERE FROM THIRTY TO FIFTY FIVE POUNDS AND S EEP IT OFF AND THE ATHIS IS GREAT I CAN ACTAYS TILL E REBIE STAKES IN SALIDS AND TBUT THERE NOT EATING CRUTONS THERE AND SO IN SOME SENSE IT LOOKS EXTREME IT SOUNDS KEY TO JANIC BUT IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT YOU'RE JUST SAYING THASICALLY STAY AWAY FROM YOURE LIMITING PROCESS FOODS YOURE LIMINATING LIQUID CALORIES IN IN GENERAL YOU AND ON AND ON AND SO THERE'S NOTHING S SOPHISTICATED ABOUT IT AND OT MY QUESTION TO YOU IS HOW MUCH OF THAT WEIGHT LOSS OF FACT YOU THINK IS A CALLORIES INIVERSIS CALORIES OUT THE FACT AUSE THEYRE EADING A LOT OF FOOD AND IN SOME CASES AND HOW MUCH OF IT YOU THINK IS THE ELIMINATION OR NEAR ELIMINATION OF THIS FROTOS OR THIS GLUCOS FROCTOS COMBINATION IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CALORIES IT AS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THE INSOLENT IF YOU GET THE INSOLENT DOWN YOUARE NOT SHUNTING INTERS YOU TO FAT YOU CAN LOSE WEIGHT YOU'RE FAT WE'LL GIVE UP ITHE ATTHE A THE THE TRUGLASTRIDES STORED IN IT AS SOON AS YOUR INSOLENT GOES DOWN INSOLENT IS PUSHING ON YOUR FAT CELL ALL THE TIME AND AS LONG AS YOURE INSOLENCE UP YOUR FATSELL CAN'T RELEASE IT THE MINUTE YOURE INSOLENT GOES DOWN YOU CAN NOW ENGAGIN WHAT WE CALL LIPOLYSIS FOREMOST SENSITIVE LIE PACE IS A AND ANDSI'M IN THE FAT SELL THAT IS A INHIBITED BY INSOLENT AS SOON AS THE INSOLENTCE GONE FOREMOST SENSITIVE LIE PASE CAN TURN THAT STORE TRIGLAS RIDE INTO FREEFATY ACIDS ANGLAS ORAL AND RELEASE IT AND YOU CAN LOSE WEIGHT SO GET THE INSOLENT DOWN AND ID ALL WORK SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT MAKES INSOLENT GO UP WHILE TWO THINGS REFINE CARBO HYDRATE IN SUGAR THOSE ARE THE TWO THINGS THAT MAKE INSOLENT GO UP IN ADDITION BRANCH CHIN TO MENOACES MAKE INSOLENT GO UP AS WELL LUCY NICE LUCING VAILING WHICH IS IN CORNFED BEEF CHICKEN AND FISH PROCES FOOD ALL RIGHT HERE'S HERE'S HERE'S THE DEAL IN ONE CONCEPT MY COLLEAGUE DOCTOR CARLOS MONTERO WHO IS A PROFESSOR PUBLIC HEALTH AT THE UNIVERSY OF SALPALLO HAS DONE THE WORLD OF GREAT SERVICE HE IS DEVELOPED A SYSTEM FOR CATEGARIZATION OF FOOD PROSISEM IT IS CALLED THE NOVA SYSTEM JUST MEANS NEW BUT HE IS BASICALLY CATEGORIZED EVERY FOOD ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD INTO ONE OF FOR CLASSES EASIEST WAY TO EXPLAIN THIS WOULD BE EXAMPLE LET'S TAKE AN APPLE NOBLE CL ASS ONE WOULD BE AN APPLE PICKED OFF A TREE NVA CLASS TOO WOULD BE APPLE SLICES THE STEM DECETED DE SKINNED MAYBE NOVA CLASS THREE WOULD BE APPLE SAUCE COOKED MASCERATED POSSIBLY IT PRESERVATIVE AD MAYBE SOME EXTRA SUGAR MAY BE NOT NOVA CLSS FOR WOULD BE A MC DONAL'S APPLE PIE NOW DOES THAT MAC DONAL'S APPLE PIE LOOK ANYTHING LIKE THAT APPLE NOW IS THERE EVEN ANY APPLE LIN IT MAYBE A TMAYBE NOT MAYBE A TIMY BIT IT'S ALL FLAVORIN HANDS ET CETERA TURNS OUT THIS IS EPIDMEOLOGIC DATA BUT NONE THE LESS PROSPECTIVE AVE TO DEVIOLOGIC DATA SO IT'S NOT USELESS THAT NOVA CLASS FOR THAT ULTRA CLASSES FOOD CATEGORY WHICH IS SEVENTY THREE PERCENT OF THE AMERICAN GROCERY STORE IS THE CLASS THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH ALL OF THESE CHRONIC MIDABLE DISEASES NOVA CLASS ONE THROUGH THREE NO PROBLEM NOW WHEN YOU SAY ASSOCIATE WHAT PERCENTAGE OF ONE'S DAILY TOTAL CLORK CAN TAKE NEEDS TO COME FROM NOVA CLASS FOR BEFORE THAT STATEMENT YOU JUST MADE IS TRUE BECAUSE IT IT I LOVE THE RECOMMENDATION YOU MADE EARLIER OR THAT LET YUS SAY THE THE CONTOUR OF A YOU DON'T HAVE TO AVOID DESERT YOU CAN ENJOY DESERT RUT DON'T ET DESERTED AT OTHER TIMES OF DAY AND MAYYOU DON'T EET DESERT EVERY SINGLE NIGHT MIS THEIR RULE THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO T DESERT EVERY SINGALS SO THE ANSWERS ABOUT SEVEN TO TEN PER CENT WOULD BE THE UPPER LIMIT SO YOU CAN GET SEVEN TO TEN PER CENT OF YOUR COLORI CAN TAKE DAILY CLORK CAN TAKE FROM THESE NOVA CLASS FOR FOODS AND STILL TEY'LL BE O C STILL BE OKE ESO THIS IS I KNOW O TA THAT'S NOT WHAT'S HAPPENED RIGHT I KNOW SOME VERY HEALTHY PHYSICIANS WHO IDID ON OBSERVE HOW PEOPLE E MOVED CAS THAT I WOULD PAY ATTENTION IN MY NOUR FIELD RIGHT II WAS LIKE OH YOU KNOW PEOPLE LL AROUND ME AT STAMPORD YOU SEE US HAVE ITS ARE WORTH SUCCESSFUL OR ELSE THEY WOULD BE THERE AS I  WHO LOOKS HEALTHY WHO CAN MAKE IT UP THE STAIRS AND DOESN'T HAVE TO TAKE THE ELEVATOR HOW MUCH EXERCISE OR PEOPLE DOING AT A GIVEN AGE ARE THEY FANATIC THE KNO LIKE FOUR IN THE MORNING RUNNERS I'M NOT KING TO DO THAT CONSISTENTLY MUSS I HAVE TO OM AND I NI OBSERVE THAT YOU KNOW MANY OF THE HALTHIEST PEOPLE I KNOW THEY MOVE A LOT DURING THE DAY THEY HATE VERY WELL MANYOF THEM SKIP BREAKFAST OR LAUNCH NOT ALWAYS AND THEN I ALSO KNOWSE THAT THEY WOULD DURINK VERY LITTLE OR NO OW CALL AND THEN BUT THEY WOULD ENJOY LIKE A OW THERE'S ONE PHYSICIAN YOU SEE US HAVE IN PARTICULAR SOMETHING OF WHO REALLY ENJOYED HIS DARK CHOCOLATE KICK CAT AFTER LAUNCH ANY SORT VERY OM CEREMONIAL ABOUT THE IRONRAVELING THAT A THE F WAL AN THE IN THE THE IND IS I OKE SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT SMALL PERCENTAGE OF CALERIES IF THIF THAT'S IF THAT'S ALL YOU DO HEY YOU KNOW GOD BLESS YOU BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOIN THAT'S THE PROBLEM MOTUM LINE THAT NOVA CLASS FOR IS WORE ALL THE ACTION IS N ERMS OF CHRONIC MEABOLIC DISEASE SO THE QUESTIONS HOW CAN YOU AVOID THAT HOW DO YOU KNOW WHICH IS WHICH WE HAVE A SOLUTION SO MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE DEVELOPED A WEB BASED TOOL THAT IS AVAILABLE TO THE ENTIRE WORLD RIGHT NOW AND YOU'LL PUT IT IN YOUR SHOW NOTES THAT WILL PUT A LINK TO THIS ABSOLUTES CALLED PERFECT P ARE EFACY T YOU CAN FIND IT AT PERFECT DOT CO AND WHAT IT IS IS IT'S A RECOMMENDATION ENGINE NOT A I WHERE YOU TALK ABOUT A I IN A MINUTE BUT IT IS A RECOMMENDATION ENGINE BASED ON THE SCIENCE OF HUMAN METABOLISM THAT CATEGORIZES FOODS BASED ON NOT THEIR NEUTRIAN CONTENT BUT ON THEIR METABOLIC EFFECT TRESIN AND SO THERE IS A NOVA FILTER WHICH WILL FILTER OUT ALL THE NOBLE CLASS FOR STUFF AND IT WILL GO TO YOUR GROCERY STORE AND WILL TELL YOU WHAT YOU CAN BY THAT WILL BE A NOBLE CLASS ONE THROUGH THREE WHICH TURNS OUT TO ONLY BE TWENTY PER CENT OF THE GROCERY STORE IT MEANS BASELY THING ON THE PERIFERY OF THE GROCERY TH AS THAT'S GENERAL IT IN GENERALL A YES ROT IS TO MEAT THE DAIR ETHE OLL THE THINGS YOU MENTIOND IN FACT SO I'M NOT LOW CARB I'M LOW INSOLEN AND THERRE LOT OF WAYS TO GET TO LOW INSOLENT GET RID OF THE REFINE CARBYDRIC GET RID OF THE SUGAR INCREASE THE FIBER GET RID OF THE BRANCH CHAIN O MENO ACIDS CA SO EATING FISH IS A GOOD PLACE TO BE A EVEN EATING A STAKE IS O KAY IF IT'S A A PASTURE FED STAKE SO LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR STAKE WULD YOU LOK A BETTER FOR THE ANIMAL THREAD IT IS ABSOLUTE SO YOU MENTION MARBLING BEFORE WE LOVE AR MARBLING IHT YOU CAN CUT OUR YOU ASK GREAT AYSTAKES WITH A BUTTER KNIFE BECAUSE THEIRE SO TENDER IHT YOVER BEEN TO ARGENTINA AN MY FATHER'S ARGIAL RIGHT THAT'S NAT YOURE ARE AIN'T ANYHOW THEY ONLY KNOW WHOR THEY ONLY KNOW GRASS GOD THE ONLY THE IDEA THAT RIT HOWS WOULD EAT ANYTHING BUT GRASS ITS SORTER LIKE THE IDEA THAT A THEN THORE'S A AL IT WOULD IT WOULD FLY ABSOLUTELY NEW ZEALAND SAME THING THE MEAT IS GORGEOUS ITS HOMOGENIUS ITS PINK ITS TE TELIFE I BEENT ARGENTINA THE MEAT IS FANTASTIC BUT YOU HAVE TO USE  STAKE KNIFE YOU CAN'T USE A BUTTER AND IT TAKES MORE CHEWING IT AND IT TAKES US SHOINGS I CUJIS IN YOU THIT'S A IT'S A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE ENTIRELY IT'S DELICIOUS BUT IT IS KIND OF A LITTLE THAT YOU KNOW TOUGHER TURNS OUT THAT MARBLING IS INTRAMIO CELLULAR LIPID THAT ANIMAL HAS METABOLIC CINTROM THE AMERICAN AND CORNFED THE AMERICAN CORN FED ANIMAL BECAUSE THAT CORN IS FILLED WITH BRANCH CHAINO MENOASSES LUCIN ISALUCING VAILING BRINCHCHINOMIOASSES OR WHAT'S IN N PROTINE POWDER THAT'S WHAT A YOU KNOW BODY BUILDERS YOU KNOW PUT IN THEI'RE SMOOTHIES YOU KNOW TO BUILD MUSCLE AND IF YOU'RE BUILDING MUSCLE THAT'S O KAY BECAUSE TWENTY PER CENT OF VEMINO ACIDS IN MUSCLE OR BRANCH CHAIN AM SO YOU KOW IF YOU'VE GOT A PLACE TO PUT THEM YOU HAVE AT IT YET THERE'S A NEED THERE HERE'S AN ERIGAN DOWN YE BUT IF YOU'RE NOT IF YOU'RE YOU AIND A MERE MORTAL LIKE ME YOU CONSUME THOSE EXCESS BRANCH CHINOMIO ACIDS THEY'RE GOING TO GO TO THE LIVER THEY'RE GOING TO BE DEAMIDATED LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER AND THEY'RE CAN END UP AS BRANCH CHAIN ORGANIC ACIDS THEY'RE GOING A FLOOD THE MITA CONJRYA THE MIGHT A CONJUR NOT AN TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THE VOLUME AND SO THEY'RE GOING TO DIVERT THE EXCESS AND TURN THAT INTO FAT AND SO NOW YOU'VE GOT HIPERTRUGLIS RIDEMIA AND CHANCE FOR FATTY LIVERED DISEASE AND INSOLENT RESISTANCE SO WHAT KIND OF MEAT YOU EAT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH YOURE METABOLIC HELTH WHAT ABOUT THE EGG THE WHOLE EGG NEAR NERE PERFECT PROATINE SCORE IN TERMS OF ITS AM A BIAVAILABILITY AM EXITERIFIC OTHERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH EGGS THERE ARE BETTER EGGS THAN OTHERS SO THATER WELL THERE'S YELLOW A YOKE EGGS AND THEY'RE ORANGE YOKE EGGS WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A YELLOW O GEG AND AN ORANGE O EGG I'M GUESSING THAT SOMETHING ABOUT THE A THE FEED OF THE THE MOTHER CHICKEN AM AND I'M GUESSING IT PROBABLY ALSO HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH COLINE CONTENT WILL MAKE A THREES AH INTERESTING  THE ORANGE A YOKE EGG HAS A LOT IF WILL MAKE A THREES IN IT WHAT ARE OTHER GREAT SOURCES OF O MEGATHREES I I'VE I KNOW SOME OFF THE TOP OF I HEAD BY LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU  CASE SO MARINE LIFE IS NUMBER ONE OK A YOU KNOW FISH PROVIDED YOU'RE NOT BRING IN HEAVY MEDALS WITVERY WELL YES SO I MEAN THAT'S ALWAYS THE THE THE ARGUMENT YOU KNOW THE QUESTION IS YOU KNOW IS HAT THE MERCURYS THAT YOU MAK A THREES ULTIMATELY I THINK ITS THEOMAGE A THREES THAT IS MORE IMPORTANT BUT YES I DO UNDERSTAND THE MERCURY ISSUE A A ULTIMATELY THERE ARE THREE ILL MAKE A THREES THERE'S ALE AL A LINA LANIC ACID WHICH YOU CAN GET INVEGETABLES THERE IS E P A I COSOPENTO ENOIC ACID WHICH YOU CAN ONLY GET IN MARINE LIFE FISHOYL COSOROYL R AND FINALLY D H E DON'T GO HEXA ENOIC ACID WHICH YOU ALSO GET FROM MARINE LIFE BUT YOU CAN GET FROM ALGY SO YOU CAN GET ALGAL OIL WHICH YOU KNOW THE VEGANS WILL USE DO YOU AM PERSONALLY TAKE ANYTHING TO INCREASE YOUR OMEGA THREE IN TAKE I KNOW THER THERE'S EVEN PRESCRIPTION O MEGA THREES I TAKE OUPSHOIL YOU TAKE O FICIAL YET YE ITHE I DOIKE THREE I ONLY TAKE THREE SUPPLEMENTS O GID LIKE TO KNOW IT OS THAT I WILL SAY THAT I ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS THE BEHAVIORS FIRST RIKE DUSIN DOWN S BEHAVOR IS NUTRITION THEN ONLY IF NEEDED AND ONE CAN AFFORD IT THEN SUPPLEMENTATION IN PRESCRIPTION DROGS AND I'M A BIG CONSUMER OF SUPPLEMENTS AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN FRANKLY SO WHAT ORE THE THREE SA YOU TAKE FISHAI OFISHOL AND DO YOU TAKE TO GET ABOV ACER IN THRESHOLD OF  P  ABOUT A THOUSAND MILIGRAMS O SAY ABOUT A GRAMADA RAMADA I CI A VIT HM INSEE HOW MUCH VIE HIM IN SEE A THOUSAND MILGRIMS ADAY YOU ENLINE IS PALLING YEW UNOL IT'S ACTUALLY FOR MY ROSATION I'VE GOT TA A A SKIN ISSUE AND INVITE HELSEHE HELTH THROUGH HULPS WITH THAT INTEREST AND FINALLY VITE HIM IND NOW I WILL TELL YOU VITE HIM INDEED IS A COMPLICATED ONE I AN WE CAN TALK ABOUT VITE HIM INDEED AND HOW EITHER IMPORTANT OR NON IMPORTANT IT IS BECAUSE THERE'S A  THERE'S A QORK DIVITE HIM INDEED AND A AIT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOUR AUDIENCE TO KNOW ABOUT ITS EVERYBODY IN HIS BROTHERS OU KNOW TOWTINGVIT HIM INDEED S E CIGER FOR EVERYTHING IT'S OR  NOTING H IS IT THAT YOU HAVE YOUR SUPPLEMENT LOVERS HATERS AND AGNOSTICS BUT VITE HIM INDEED SOMEHOW MADE IT THROUGH THE SHUE LIKE EVERYONE'S LIKE PROVITE HIM INDEED IS REALLY INTERIS O MOUVITE HIM INDEED PEOPLE ARE COMFORTABLE TAKING A JE A VITEHIM INDEE TAIL CAP BUT LIKE OTHER SUPPLEMENTS WHERE YOU SAY ALL LIKE MAY BE OM THIS MIGHT BE GOOD FOR A YOU KNOW LIKE OLL M GET THREESAN FISH OW THEM PUPEALOBIT LIKE MORE STAND OFFICE IT'S REALLY INTERESTING THAT THE KIND OF PSYCOSO SOCIAL STUFF AROUND THIS HOW MUCH VITE HIM INDEED DO YOU PERSONALLY TAKE I TAKE FIVE THOUSAND UNITS TO DAY I CA SO DO I VITE HIM IN THES COMPLICATED THOUGH HERE'S THE PROBLEM IF YOU LOOK AT THE LITERATURE VITE HIM INDEED DEFICIENCY IS ASSOCIATED WITH ALL THESE CHRONIC METABOLIC DISEASES HOWEVER SUPPLEMENTATION WITH VITE HIM INDEED HAS NOT FIXED ANY OF THOSE SO IF YOU INVITE HIM INDEED DEFICIENT WHY WOULDN'T SUPPLEMENTATION FIX IT COUPLE OF REASONS ONE ONE OF THE REASONS FOR VIT HIM INDEE DEFICIENCIES CAUSE EVERYONE'S DRINK IN SOFFDRINGS THAT'S ONE REASON BUT THERE'S A MORE IMPORTANT REASON A SUGAR AND ARTIFICIALLY SWEET IN SOFTRINGS YET CAN DEPLETE VITE HIM INDEED UTILE IS IT WILYOU NOT CONSUMING DARY CAS YOUR CONSUMING SOFFTRINGS BUT I CAN'T TOLERATE MILC ANY MORE WELL YEAN TAKE VIT IM INT BUT HERE'S THE HERE'S THE REAL NUGGET OF TRUTH AND THIS IS A LITTLE COMPLICATED BUT THE INDECHRONOLOGISTS IN THE AUDIENCE WILL GET IT VITE HIM INDEED IS A PRE PRO HORMON IT'S NOT IT'S NOT ACTIVE AT ALL VITE HIM INDEED S CONVERTED IN THE LIVER FIRST STEP TO A COMPOUND CALL TWENTY FIVE I DROCY VITE HIM INDED THAT IS A PROHORMON IT ALSO IS INACTIVE IT HAS NO ACTIVITY WHATSOEVER FROM THERE TWENTY FIVE HYDROX IVITE HIM IND CAN BE METABOLIZED ONE OF TWO WAYS IT CAN EITHER BE ONE ALFHA HYDROXILATED IN THE C IDNEY TO THE ACTIVE FORM ONE ELEPHA IT'S ONE O TWENTY FIVE DIE HYDROXY VIT EM IND WHICH WILL THEN DO ALL F THE BUSINESS A VIT EM IND SUCH AS CALCIUN ABSORPTION FROM THE GUT SUPPRESSION OF THE IMUNE SYSTEM AT THE TOLL LIKE RECEPTOR FOUR THAT SOUND LIKE A BAD THING NO AS A GOOD I KNOW BUT I HAD TO BRING THAT OUT AUS IT WHEN YE SAYS SUPPRESSION THAT YOU INSISTEM PE ARE MA MURA SUPPRASS NO THAT SOUND LIKE AIDS A GOOD IT SUPPRESSES INFLAMMATION IT'S A GOOD THING ATS SUPPRESSION INFMITION AND THAT'S ACTUALLY THE POINT THAT WERE WERE GETTING TO SO THERE ARE LOT OF GOOD THINGS ABOUT ONE TWENTY FIVE DI HYDROXY VITEM IND HOWEVER THAT TWENTY FIVE HYDROXY D THAT CAME OUT OF THE LIVER CAN BE METABOLIZED A DIFFERENT WAY IT CAN BE TWENTY FOUR HYDROCALATED IN INFLAMMATORY TISSUE LIGHT TO BERCULOS I SARCOID GOT INFLAMMATION AND SO YOU WILL END UP TAKING YOUR TWENTY FIVE HYDROXY D WHICH IS A PROHORMON AND TURNING IT INTO THE INACT OF TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE DI HYDROXY D WHICH THEN JUST GETS EXCREETED OUT SO IN OTHER WORDS YOU CONSUMED ALL THIS VITEM IND AND IT DIDN'T GO WHERE YOU NEEDED IT TO GO AND THE REASON WAS BECAUSE YOU'RE INFLAMED YOU HAVE TO FIX THE INFLAMMATION BEFORE THE VITEM IND CAN BE EFFECTIVE AND NINETY THREE PERCENT OF AMERICANS ARE INFLAMED SO GIVING THEM VITEM ND IT'S NOTLAT INTO A DAMNED THING OT IS REDUCING FORTUS IN TAKE THAT ONE OF THE PRIMARY WAYS TO REDUCE THE STEMIC INFLAMMATION ABSOLUTELY WHAT ARE SOME OTHERS REDUCING OXIDATIVE STRESS IN GENERAL SO HEAVY METALS LIKE ADMEUM IN CADMIUMS VERY HIGH AND CHOCOLATE SPECIALLY SOUTH AMERICAN CHOCOLATE SORRY NOW I AM NOT A FAN O CHOCOLATE I COT OCCASIONLLY LIKE A LOTTLE DARK CHOCOLATE VI CAID A SO IF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO A E CHOCOLATE THEY SHOULD BE CAREFUL HOW MUCH CHOCOLATA WELL IS RET OF IN SOUTH AMERICAN CHALKLAT IN PROCESS CHOCOLATE I MEAN THE REALLY GOOD LO  A ME ON THE HITLESS OF SO MANY INDUSTRIES TAYES A THATS AT ON TA ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS I'VE BEEN ON THE HITLESS FOR A DECADE NUMBS TERE YOU'RE JUST ONE BIG TARGET YT REGOTET I GOT I IT'S ON MY BACK IN A TICTINYWHERE I READY GOT THAT A A THERE ARE A THE MAIN THING IS TO MAKE THAT GOT WORK RIGHT SO FIBER SHORCHAIN FADIAS A PRODUCTION FROM FIBR I IS A HUGE YOU KNOW A BOON A REDUCE INFLAMMATION REDUCEINFLAMMA NOT IMPROVING SLEEP IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT UNOCHRONIC SLIGHT SLEEP DEPROVATION CAN ININCREASE INFLAMMATION WELL WHAT IT WILL DO IS INCREASE QUARTER SOUL AND CHRONICALLY INCREASE QARTER SOL WILL DEFINITELY LAD TO INCREASED INFLAMMATION IN WHICH IS FUNNY CRAUS CUARTERSOULS USUALLY CONSIDERED THE ANTINE FLAMRITOY BUT ON LE ACUTELY RIHT CHRONIC CARTESL ELEVATION DOES THE ALPO SAY F WIF WE CAN W CONTRIBUTE TO I HAVE THIS SECRET A GENDA WHICH IS NET WHICH IS NOT A SECRET WHICH IS THAT PEOPLE THINK CORTIS ALL IS BAD WHEN IN FACT ACUTELY CORTIS ALL DOES WONDERFUL THINGS PROVIDED ITS HAPPENING AT THE RIGHT TIME OF DAY WLAN SHIFTED CORT IS ALL BAD  TOO MUCH OR TOO FREQUENT CORT IS ALL BAD BUT CARTESAL OU YOU NEED IT IT'S SO ESSENTIAL ND I THINK MUST FEE WHICH IS HERE CARTIS ALL IN HIS BENSSOCIATE WITH ALL THINGS BAD AND AND MAY WE CAN SHHALPCHIFF THAT NERRNO II'M VERY HAPPY EVIENCS AN INTE CHRONOLOGIST NOF THIS IS IN A WERE MY WELL HOUSE IS WHERE I LIVE A CARTESOL IS A GOOD NEWS BAD NEWS DEAL LIKE SO MANY THINGS SHORT TERN GANE FOR LONG TURN PAIN SO WHEN YOU ARE IN WHAT WE CALL ALOSTASIS THAT IS PERTURBATION OF HOEASTASIS THAT IS A STRESS IN ACUTE STRESS CARTESOL IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HELPS YOU MANAGE THAT BODILY AND MENTAL STRESS SO AN ENGLISH TEST A COR ACCIDENT RUNNING AWAY FROM THE LION IU O FAMOUS IN O PIG ME RUNNING AWAY FROM THE LION ALL OF THOSE REQUIRE CARTE SOUL IN ORDER TO MANAGE AND MITIGATE THAT STRESS THE UPCOMING TWENTY TWENTY FOUR ELECTION THAT'S CHRONIC STRESS IT ISS NOT A KINOSTRESS IME AT'S THE WORST THEY'LL BE THE ONLY MENTION OF POLITICS YES MONCAS A AND WE DON'T HAVE TO GO THERE BUT WE'RE ALL CHRONICALLY STRESS AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHY THAT IS AND WHAT'S GOING ON AND I'M ACTUALLY VERY INTERESTIN THAT AN A COLLEAGUE OF MINE IN PARIS AND I HAVE BUILT A COMPUTATIONAL MODEL OF THE LYMBIC SYSTEM WHICH FOCUSES ON THE STRESS CENTR OF THE BRAIN THE MIGDELA TO UNDERSTAND HOW CHRONIC STRESS IS DIFFERENT FROM ACUTE STRESS AND HOW THAT CHRONIC STRESS ULTIMATELY LEADS TO METABALIC AND MENTAL HEALTH DISASTER VERY INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT THAT BEFORE WE TOUCH ON THAT YOU'VE WORT A LOT WITH KIDS A PEOPLE AGE AS YOU PUT IT ZERO TO NINETEEN I DON'T KNOW BOUT THE THE EXACT NUMBERS BUT WHEN I WAS GROWING UP THERE WERE SOME KIDS IN SCHOOL THAT WERE OVER WEIGHT BUT IT WAS THE OCCASIONAL KID HT NOW IT SEEMS TO PENNY ON WIRE ONE DRAWS THE THRESHOLD FOR OVER WEIGHT IT SEEMS THAT THERE ARE LOT OF KIDS THAT ARE OVERWEIGHT A HOW ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OBS AND FORTY PER CENT OVERWEIGHT I SO OBVIOUSLY A SERIOUS PROBLEM SERIOUS NOW AN GOING FORWARD ANDO WHAT ABOUT ADULTS IN THE UASS AM IREMEMBER SEEING AT A MEETING A MAP OF OB SITY IN THE YOU ASK AND AM OVER TIME AND IT VERY QUICKLY FILLED IN FROM VERY FEW PEOPLE WRE OBEAS TO VERY MANY COLORADO IS THIS A WAS THIS L LIKE BEAKIN OF OF OF FIT PEOPLE BUT NOW IT'S NO LONGER AND THAT'S BL SHU TO O A  I'LL TELL YOU WHY THE THERE'RE FOR THINGS THAT CAN INCREASE MY TICONDRIAL ABY A GENESIS YOU COU TELL ME ALTITUDE IS COLD I O MY COLORADOS LESSOBIS ALTITUDE THAT'S LY COLOR A IS LESS OBIS AND A A R THE OTHER TWO BUT THOSE WITH THE REASON TIT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH BEING MORE FIT IT HAD TO DO WITH COLD AND ALTITUDE EXAMPLE SWITZERLAND COMPARED TO GERMANY THEY GOT THE SAME CRAFTY FOOD BUT SWITZERLAND HAS HALF THE OBIOSITY THE GERMANY DOES I LON SWITZERLAND IS HIGHER I LOVE THE FOOD WHEN I GO TO MUNUCH I LOVE THE SCHNITZELS AN WONDER TOS OUR CROWD AND THEY GOT THAT ISSWITZERLAND TO I SO THA GREAT FOOD  SWITZERLAND'S LESSOBIOS IT SAME WAY COLORADOS LESSOBIS IT'S BECAUSE OF THE ALTITUDE YYOU MENTION COLD A MANY LISTENERS THIS PODCAST ARE AT LEAST INTERESTED IN SOME A ALSO PRACTISE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE COLD SHOWERS COLD PLUNGES MAINLY FOR THE AM I THINK THE BEST ATE ARE THE INCREASE IN CATACOLA MEANS UP AN IFRONARPAN IFRAN DOPA MEAN THAT ARE LONG LASTING PEOPLE FEEL A BIG STATESHIF THEY FEEL BETTER BUT WHEN ONE LOOKS AT THE EFFECTS ON MATABILISM THEY'RE PRETTY SLIGHT THEY ARET IS THEIR SLIGHT HOWEVER STUDIES LIKE THAT TO ME ALWAYS SEEM A SHORT SIGHTED IN THE SENSE THAT IF THERE'S A LONGER ART OF EFFECT ON THE MIGHT OF CONDRIA THAT'S AFFECTING OTHER THINGS IN TERMS OF HOW CALLORIES ARE PROCESSED OR HOW CALLORIES ARE FEEDING INTO A MITO CONDRIAL FUNCTION OR DISFUNCTION THERE I COULD SEE HOW IT MIGHT SHIFT THE AM SHIFT THE SCALE SO TO SPEAK I MEAN COLD AS IT IS AN AMAZINGLY POWERFUL STIMULANS  AND AM I THINK OF LIGHT COLD FOOD MOVEMENT SOUND LIKE THE CORE FOR WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN SHIFT PHYSIOLOGY EASILY ALL F THESE THINGS ARE EMINENTLY MANIPULABLE AND FOR ALMOST ZERO DOLLARS  BUT YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND RIGHT NOW WE'VE BEEN ACTUALLY KEPT FROM THAT KNOWLEDGE AND YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE ADDICTED IT'S REALLY HARD TO UNEDICT YOURSELF SO THAT BRINGS US BACK TO THIS THING ABOUT AM FOOD INDUSTRY CONSPIRACIES GOVERNMENT CONSPIRACIES AND THE REST BOY THE SIS CAN TO BE AN INTERESTING UM GOD SACTION BY WHAT ARE WE DO LIKE SO IF YOU AND I GO UP TO CAP CAPITAL HILL WHICH I'VE DONE YWHICH YOU'E DAWN IN AND MAY BE I'LL JOIN YOU SOME DAY  AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE USEE US ALF OM DOWN AT STAN FOR YOUR CLINITION I'M A SCIENTISTS AND AND A PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATE A PODCASTER AND WE EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE HEY LISTEN LIKE THERE'S THAT THE FOOD IS LACED WITH THA DRUG IT'S MIT IT'S NOT EVEN REALLY FOOD IT'S IT'S RIGHT S NOT FOOD IT'S AN AGGREGATE OF FOOD AND NON FOOD PARTS THAT MAKE YOU THINK ITS FOOD IT'S ORE LIKE S TIME PEOPLE HAY YOUR KIDS ARE OU OTHER SWIMMING IN A SWIMMING POR LOOKS LIKE WATER BUT IT'S ACTUALLY PART POISON IN IT'S AND IT'S HARMING THEM IT'S GIVING THEM O IF YOU SAY THOSE KINDS OF THINGS I MEAN CONGRESS MEN AND WOMEN ARE THEY'RE LIKE REASONABLY SMART PEOPLE RIGHT I MEAN ARE ARE THEY GIN TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT NO WHAT SO WHERE IS THE CONFLICT IS IT THAT THE FOOD IN DISTRY HAS OM THE GOVERNMENT BY THE SHORT HAIRS THIT'S EXACTLY RIGHT AND THEY HAVE THEM BY THE SHORTHAIRS WHERE I MEAN IS IT THEY LINING THEIR POCKET'S SOMEMING WHERE WHERE THHERE IS THE LAVERAGE ACTS ACTUALLY EXERTED O CASE SO THER THEY ARE LINING THEIR POCKETS THAT'S NUMBER ONE THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE WE HAVE THE DAY TO SUPORT THAT BLANCH LINCOLN WHO WAS A SENATOR FROM ORKANSEL WHO'S THE CHAIRMAN OF THE NTRICIAN COMMITTE OU HD T SEE HER CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS EVERY TIME SHE WAS UP FOR REELECTIONS SO IT'S ALL ABOUT GETTING REELECTED OR IT'S ABOUT THEM LIKE HAVING A LIKE A THIRD HOME IN H HAMPTONS II THINK IT'S THE THIRD HOME IN THE HAMPTONS WHO CAN WITHTHIN IS IT'S REALLY AS BAD AS IT IS AS SOME OF THE DOCUMENTARIES WITHOUT MAS TOLIEVE WITHOUT QUESTION GOUD NO AND WECAN AN WE HAVE THE DATA THERE IS A A AN ORGANIZATION THAT A ABSOLUTEY WONE TO CALL OUT BECAUSE THEY ARE YOU NA THEMOST AGREGIOUS ORGAN A A POLITICAL ORGANIZATION ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH THEY'RE CALLED THE AMERICAN LEGISLATIVE EXCHANGE COUNSIL ALIC OR ALIC AND THEY RIGHT BILLS THEY ARE A BILL MILL  AND THEY ARE FOR WHOEVER GIVES THEM MONEY AND WHO GIVES THEM MONEY BIG FARMA BIG AGRA BIG IL AND A A BIG FOOD AN YOURE SOE YOUR INCLUDING BIG FARMER YOUR PHYSICIAN YOU'VE WRITTEN SCRIPTS BEFORE YOU'VE WRITTEN PRESCRIPTIONS FROPATIONS BEFORE ISN'T THAT FARME THAT PROVIDES THE DRUGS THAT ALLOWS YOUR PATIENTS TO FEEL BETTER WELL THE QUESTION IS DO THEY DO THEY FEEL BETTER THIS IS A BIG QUESTION LET'S YOU WANT TA GOING  RITING O GO I BUT YOU'RE WRITING THE SCRIPT I MEAN THAT MA I'M JUST TRY OHUNTRIN AGI'M NOTOWNG YOU BUT I SEE OO YOU DON'T THRE WOU HOVE TO BE INSTANCES WHERE SOME ONE STHYROY DEFICIENT AND YOU GIVE THEM  YOU KNOW AOAO SO IF IF YOU'VE GOT A DISEASE AND A MEDICINE WILL REPLACE WHAT'S MISSING SURE K SO FOR DEFICIENCY DISEASES WHICH AS AN INE CHRONOLOGISTS THAT'S WHAT I DO ABSOLUTELY AND I DID THAT YOU KNOW WITH NO COMPUNCTION OF A A IMPROPRIETY WHATSOEVER BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT LET'S START WITH STATENS STATENS LOWER EL DIEL O K THE STATENS REDUCE HART DISEASE YES OR NOL YOU KNOW I SEEM TO BE WIFTING TO DAY ON ALL THE QUIZES AND A R MA AT THI LEVEL I'M MON A GO WITH NO BUT BUT I WILL SAY YOU KNOW MY FRIEND AND I THINK IS EXPERT A PHYSICIANS WELL YOU O PETER ATEA AND OTHERS YOU KNOW HAS TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE POSITIVE ATTRIBUTES OF STATENS IN CERTAIN CASES FOR CERISI CERTAIN CASES THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT AND I COMPLETELY AGREE AND BY THE WITH PETER'S A FRIEND AND YOU KNOW SOME DAY WILL OLL YOU KNOW ALL YOU KNOW GO OLT DRINKIN TOGETHER WI WON'T DRINK WET AR WO Y HAV AWISHARIS DAY SHARES YA TER A A SOLUTE   YOU GOT IT YOU GAS I DON'T I DON'T IF YOU YOU D DRINKS TE LE ER IF YOU'RE LISTENING E YOU DRINS THE LOW OR  HOUSE ON ME YON'T YOU DESERT OR THE OR THA IL CAL ANY MORE BUT BUT I'M AND IT'S NOT SHO I CAN LEVE TO BE HONOUR IN TWITIANCS I CAN LIKE OT THE NEXT MORNING AND AND A KEEP UP WITH YOU GUES IT'S IN  I GET THE SO FOR PRIMARY PREVENTION THAT IS YOUR ELDEELS HIGH YOU NEED A STATEN THAT'S PRIMARY PREVENTION YOU HAVEN'T DECLARED YOURSELF YOU HAVEN'T HAD AN EVENT FOR PRIMARY PREVENTION THE MEAN INCREASE IN LIFE'S PAN FOR BEING ON A STATEN IS FOUR DAYS POR DAS TOR DAYS RS AN AN TO CHO THAT'S THAT'S A AND THE RISK FOR DIABETIS IS TWENTY PER CENT INCREASE WHAT ABOUT ANY IMPROVEMENT AND IN QUALITY OF LIFE NONE FOR PRIMARY PREVENTION NOW FOR SECONDARY PREVENTION FOR SECONDARY NOTHER AS YOU'VE ALREADY DECLARED YOURSELF YOU ALREADY HAVE A PROBLEM FOR SECONDARY PREVENTION THAT'S WHERE STATENS SHINE SO THERE'S A VALUE TO THEM I'M NOT ARGUING THAT AND IF YOU HAVE FAMILIAL HYPOCLESTRIALEMIA WHICH IS ONE AND FIVE HUNDRED  NOT ONLY YOU NEED A STATN BUT YOU NEEDLE OF FATIET AND A PRIEST OUQUE SO THERE IS DEFINITELY A VALUE TO STATENS BUT NOT FOR PRIMARY PREVENTION BUT THAT'S WHATEVERYBOD WHATEVERY DOCTOR'S DOING O YOUR ELDY ELL ITS OVER EIGHTY YOU KNOW YOU NEED A STATN THAT'S RIDICULOUS THAT IS ABSOLUTELY A JOKE AND THE DATA SHOW THAT IN FACT IN FACT MY COLLEAGUEUS SEEM MALHOTRA IN THE UKE PARTICIPATED IN AN ANALYSIS WHERE THEY TOOK THE ENTIRE YOU K POPULATION AND THEY TOOK OUT EVERYBODY UNDER AGE SIXTY FIVE SO LOOKING AT PEOPLE SIXTY FIVE TO NINETY AND IT TURNED OUT THAT THE ELDIA LEVEL CORRELATED WITH LONGEVITY THE HHIGHER THE ELDIEL THE LONGER THEY LIVED WHEN YOU TOOK OUT ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAD PROBLEMS SO ELDIL IS NOT REALLY THE PROBLEM AND THE REASONS CUS THEARE TOO ELL DELLS THERE'S ONE COLD LARGE BOY INTO THIS ONE CALLD SMALL DENTE TURNS OUT DIETARY FAT RAISES YOUR LARGE BOYANT YOUR LARGE BOYANT IS IRRELEVHANT IT IS CARDIO VASCULARLY NEUTRAL BUT THAT'S THE ONE THE STATN'S EFFECTS THE SMALL DENSE THAT'S THE ATHROGENIC PARTICLE WHEN YOUR SMALL DENSE EL DELIS HIGH THAT MEANS YOU ARE NOT CLEARING TRUGLISERIDE PEFERLY BECAUSE THAT'S WITH SMALL DENTE SHOW YOU THAT'S THAT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS TO TRUGLISS RIDE IS BECAUSE THEY BECOMES SMALL DENTE CAN I TAKE A GUESS AND SAY THAT THE BEST WAY TO REDUCE SMALL DENSIS TO REDUCE INSOLEN YES BY REDUCING SUGAR BECAUSE THAT TRIGLASRRITE IS MADE IN THE LIVER TS OLE PULMITATE AND THATS THE ONLY FAT THAT THE LIVER KNOWS HOW TO MAKE AND SO TRAGLASERITE IS YOURE LIVER OUTPUT OF CARBAL HYDRATE THAT'S HOW YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT TRUGLISTRU SO TRUGLAS TRI TURNS OUT TO BE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT AS A CRARDY OF ASCULEROUS FACTOR THEN ELDIAL EVER WAS SO DIS THE DOES BIG FARMA AND BIG FOOD DO THEY KNOW ALL OF THUS YES I KNOW THEY KNOKECAUSE THEY'VE TOLD ME SO AND BUT THEY HAVE STATENS TO SO AND FOODS IN THE I THE KNOW OFA CLASS FOR THEY KNOW THIS TO SO OU NOMAN OPTIMIST ERE YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT'S A GOING TO TAKE TO REALLY MOVE THE NEEDLE AN YOU DESCRIBED THE FOUR BARRIERS UM WERE TRYING TO ADD TO THE KNOWLEDGE COMPONENT NOW UM YO WHAT'S AGAIN TAKE IS I GOING TO TAKE A YOU KNOW HAVING A PRESIDENTIN AN OFFICE OR A CONGRESS PEOPLE IN OFFICE THAT REALLY UNDERSTANIN CARE ABOUT THIS STUFF YE MEAN TO REALLY REVAMP THE WHOLE SYSTEM ET SO RIGHT NOW THE SYSTEM IS COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY BROKEN COMPLETELY NETLY BROKEN AND THERE'S A REASON WHY IT'S COMPLETELY NOTRLY BROOKECAUSE THE FOOD IN STREET LIKES IT THAT WAY WELL IT'S PROFITABLE FOR THEM OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE FIFTY ONE DIFFERENT FEDERAL AGENCIES THAT MANAGE OUR FOOD FIFTY ONE AND NONE OF THEM KNOW WHAT THE OTHER ONES DOING AND THE FOOD IN THE STREET LIKES IT THAT WAY SO  COMMUNICATION ACROSS THESE FIFTY ONE ORGANIZATIONS WOULD HELP WELL IF WE HAD A CENTRALIZED FOOD A ZAR OR FOOD YOU KNOW IF WE SPLIT THE FOOD OF T F D  BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE IT'S NOT THE FT  IT'S THE D  OR THE FT IS NOT THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATIONS THE FEDERAL DRUG ADMINISTRATION THEY SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON DRUGS EY SPEND ALMOST NO TIME ON FOOD LIT'S THINK ABOUT WHERE THERE'S BEEN SUCCESS SO I CAN RECALL WHEN PEOPLE SMOKED ON PLAINS I ACTUALLY RECALL GOING TO A GIM IN EUROPE AND THERE WAS AN ASH TRAY MOULDED INTO THE SQUAT RACK YET THAT WAS TELLING I DON'T SEE PEOPLE SMOKING CIGARETTES AROUND STAMFORD HOSPITAL ANY MORE BUT I REMEMBER WHEN THEY INITIALLY SAID THAT PEOPLE COULDN'T SMOKE ANYWHERE EXCEPT IN WITH THIS ONE LITTLE DESIGNATED AREA ND THAT'S TYPICALLY WHAT YOU SEE NOWDAYS AND MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE ANTI SMOKING CAMPAIGN AT LEAST FOR KIDS FOR PEOPLE EIGHTEEN AND YOUNGER WAS THAT TELLING PEOPLE IT WAS BAD FOR THEIR HEALTH DIDN'T WORK AT'S SHOWING THEM LUNGS THAT WERE DE CRAPIT DIDN'T WORK THAT NOT WHAT WORKED WAS SHOWING THEM COMMERCIALS OF CACKLING HANDWRITHING UM WHIT GUYS WHO WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY THEY WERE MAKING OFF OF THESE UM A NAIVE KIDS WHO WERE BUYING CIGARETTES ANOTHER TOBACCO PRODUCT SO IT BECAME A THE THE EFFECTIVE CAMPAIGN T AND SMOKING G IN YOUNG PEOPLE WAS TO HIGH JACK THEYRE INHERIT REBELLIOUSNESS OF YOUTH AND THEN THEY WERE LIKE NO ENOK IN A A MANDZREKIT TO THEM LIKE  YOU KNOW THAT THE AS MY FRIEND CALLS IT LIKE THE TWO BIT THE TWO FINGER BUSINESS CAR AN NO AND SO THAT WORKED THAT WORKD I SOMEMODINS MAKING A COME BACK WHEN VAPINGAS A SEPARATE EPPISIDE WE WANT IT INTO THAT BUT BECAUSE NICCOTINA DILL ADICTIVE BYT YOU DON'T SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE SMOKING CIGARETTS SO WE WORK LIKE SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD NEVER IMAGINE COULD EVER WORK WORKE WELL SO YES NO I MEAN THAT'S PART OF IT I'M NOT O TO TELL YOU THAT'S NOT IT IS PART OF IT A AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THAT COULD BE APPLIED TO ANOTHER A A AA TOXS EXSUPTANS SUGAR WE HAD BERKELEY VERS'S BIG SODA YOU KNOW THAT'S HOW BERKELEY ENDED UP WITH ITS SOTA TACKS THAT DATES BACK TO TWO THOUSAND AND TECITIOF BERKELEY CITY BERKELEY WE JUST CELEBRATED THE FIVE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE BERKELEY SODA TACKS AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACTUALLY LOOK JUSTATIONAL DIABEDIES WAIG DOWN IL BE CITY DOWN SLIGHTLY NOT A LOT BUT A LITTLE BIT A CARTV ASCUE DISEASE DOWN DEAN SHILLINSIRE AND CHRISTMADSON AT THAT YOU SEEASEF AND YOU SEE BERKELEY JUST PRESENTED AT SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL JUST A THREE WEEKS AGO SO A SO T ATTACKS LIKE THE CIGARETTE TACX LIKE TIS MAKE SOTA EXPENSIV EXACT SO YOU TELL ME THAT IT CANA COK THAT I BUY ON SHATIC AVENUE AND BERKELEY COST MORE THAN A CANNI COKE THAT I BUY IN ON UNIVERSIY AVENUE IN PALLAUTHA IT DOES OKI BY A DIME AND NOW WAS AND SUFFICIENT ENOUGH TO TO CREATE THIS KIND OF CHANGE WELL YES IT I MONEY HURTS CAUSE MONEY HURTS EXACTLY SO INDRY THERE HAVE BEEN FOUR COUNTEM FOUR CULTURAL TECTONIC SHIFTS IN AMERICA IN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS AND THEY'RE ALL UNDENIABLE HERE THEY ARE NUMBER ONE BICYCLE HELMENTS AND SEAT BELTS NA EVERYBODY USES THUS TWO SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES NOBODY DOES THAT THREE A DRON'T DRIVING HOPEFULLY F YOUER PEOPLE ARE DOING THATFOUR CONDEMS AND BETHRES CONDEMS IN BATHROOMS AND BETHERS IN PUBLIC BETHRES YE YOU SEE THOSE OF MORE AVAILABLE IN THIRTY YEARS AGO IF A LEGISLATOR STOOD UP IN A STATE HOUSE AND PROPOSED LEGISLATION FOR ANYONE OF THOSE FOUR AND I DON'T CARE FORSON A STATE HOU SIR AND A CONGRESS OR PARLIAMENT OR THE DUMAR ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD THAT AGAN LAUGHED RIGHT OUT OF TOWN NANY STAY LIBERTY AN SHRES GET OUT OF MY KITCH END GET OUT OF MY BATH AND GET OUT OF MY CAR TODAY RALL FACS LIFE NOBODY'S BELLIACHING ABOUT ANY OF THOSE POINT IS WE WERE ABLE TO SOLVE THOSE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH TO BACKLES HOW DID WE DO IT HOW DID WE SOLVE THOSE FOR NO ONE COULD IMAGINE THAT WE WOULD EVER SOLVE SMOKING RIGHT BUT WE DID SORT OF ANDWE BROUGHT CONSUMPTION DOWN BY HALF  THAT'S PRETTY GOOD WHEN YOU THINK OFTOUT I WEN ADDICTIVES HOW MANY FEWERE PEOPLE ARE DYING OF LONGCANCER NOWADAYS AND TH OS IT'S LIKE EIGHTY PER CENT LOWER WAT IS ALSO BAN IMPROVEMENTS IN TREATMENT BUT YI NO BUT IT'S IT'S DIG NOSE TIT IT'S INTAN INCIDENT INCENTS GONE T AMAZA EH BECAUSE TOBACCO'S GONE DEM SO THE QUESTION IS HOW DID THAT HAPPEN THE ANSWERS VERYS AND WHY DID IT TAKE THIRTY YEARS TO DO IT WE TAUGHT THE CHILDREN THE CHILDREN GREW UP AND THEY VOTED AND THE NAY SAYERS ARE DEAD THAT'S HOW YOU MAKE A CULTURAL TECTONIC SHIFT SO WE NOW HAVE THIS REAL FOOD MOVEMENT WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ERE ARGUING AGAINST ULTRAPROCESS FOOD WE HAVE KIDS WHO ARE DEMANDING DIFFERENT IN THEIR SCHOOLS AND BY THE WAY WHAT IS THE BIGGEST FAST FOOD FRANCHISE IN THE UNITED STATES  GET THIS WRONG SO TRY ME AGAIN I DON'T KNOW I'VE NEVER TRIED IT BUT I'VE HEARD OF A IS IT CHICK FALA NO TIT MAK DOCNALS I DON'T KNOW IT IS THIS NATION'S PUBLIC SCHOOLS AH YOU CAN ADD UP MAC DONALDS SUBWAY BURGER KING EY AND A WENDYS AND EVERY OTHER A FAST FOOD FRANCHISE JACK IN THE BOX EVERY FASTFOOT FRANCHISE IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY AND WOULD ONLY BE HALF OUR NATIONS PUBLIC SCHOOL HOW SO COULD YOU IMAGINE A WORLD WHERE THEY WERE NO CLASS THREE WERE CLASS BOR NOVA FOODS ALLOWED IN IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND WE'RE DOING IT SO I AM THE CHIEF SCIENCE OFFICER OF A NON PROFIT AND PUT THIS IN THE SHOW NOTES CALLED EAT REAL EAT REALEDOUT ORG AND WE HAVE A NEW BUSINESS MODEL FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS SO IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE THE DEPARTMENT F EDUCATION ISSUED AN ADMINISTRATIVE ORDINANCE CALLED RESOLUTION TO FORTY TWO ANDTHEY DID THIS PURELY ON MONITARIISIONS RECENS TIS WAS UNDER NIXON AND WHAT THIS RESOLUTION TO FORTY TWO SAID WAS THAT ALL SCHOOL CAFETERIAS ALL THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY HAD TO MAKE BOOK THEY HAD TO BASICALLY COVER THEIR COSTS THEY COULDN'T BE LOST LEADERS FOR THE SCHOOL THEY HAD TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES WELL THIS SENT EVERY FOOT SERVICE DIRECTOR IN HE COUNTRY SCURRYING FOR IN HOW MAGAN A DO THIS CAUSE I GOT ALL THESE YOU KNOW A YOU A LUNCH LADIES YOU KNOW WHICH  PERSONNEL AND AND FOOD PREPARATION EQUIPMENT AND AND AND COS YOU KNOW THAT  YOU KNOW MOUNTING HOW AMI GOING TO BREAK EVEN THEY COULDN'T DO IT SO IN WALKS YOU KNOW ORAMARKAND A SISCO AND AGUGENHEIM AND MDONALDS AND THEY SAY HEY WILL DO IT FOR YOU WILL PROVIDE EVERY KID IN AMERICA WITH A NUTRICIOUS MEAL EVERY SINGLE DAY HOT LUNCH WELL THEY DIDN'T SAY HOT OKE THET JUST AT LUNCH NUTRICIOUS THEY SAID NUTRICIO AND I PUT THAT NEAR QUOTS TO CAUSE IT WASN'T NUTRICIOUS AND HERE'S THE ADDED BENEFIT YOU CAN TAKE YOUR FOOD PREPARATION FACILITIES AND YOUR A A  FOOTPRINT IN THE SCHOOL AND YOU CAN TURN THAT INTO CLASS ROOMS CAUSE YOURE GIN A MEETUM AND THAT WAS THE GOL BECAUSE AS SOON AS YOU'VE MOVED THE FOOD PREPARATION FACILITIES OUT OF THE SCHOOL YOU ARE NOW HOSTAGE TO THE FOOD IN THE STREET FOR THE REST OYOUR LIFE AND I COULD ALSO SEE HOW THAT ALLOWS ROOM FOR THEM TOU USE THESE COMMODITIZED FOODS FOOS THAT HAVE VERY LONG SHELL FOR LIFE EXACTLY RIGHT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ME NOFF YOU ONLY SOLD IM YOU KNOW TWO THIRDS OF THE LUNCH IS THAT WERE PREPARED THAT ON NEXT TUESDAY AFTER THE WEEK AND YOU COULD STILL GIVE THEM FOOD THAT ISN'T MOULDY EXACTLY RIGHT AND T I WILL TELL YOU SO THAT'S HOW IT HAPPENED AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY TRACE I CUS SCHOORES AND READING AND MATH SCOORES IN THIS COUNTRY DOWN FROM NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE TO TODAY WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL I WAS ALOWED TO GET I CALL THAT HOT LUNCH CAUSE IT WAS USUALLY HOT IT WAS AM ALLOWED TO GET THE SCHOOL LUNCH ONE DAY A WEEK ONE DAY WE OTHER DAYS I HAD TO BRING MY LUNCH AND THAT ONE DAY WAS PRETTY SPECIAL LIKE YOU FELLICE YOU WERE GETTING A TREAT I WAS USUAL LIKE CORN DOG AT WERE A HAMBURGER THE HAMUR WAS PRETTY PAULTRY BUT ANTHE AMS A COMMODITIZED TAN BURY I COMMOTIZE HAMBURGER M YET TO GO LOOKING FOR THE PADTY PORGAN A AND THE BREAD WAS SWEETEN AND SO AS IT WAS DIFFERENT BUT IM I DON'T REMEMBER NEARLY AS MUCH WOLD BE S I WENTO TO HIGH SCHOOL IN THE EARLY NINETIES I SEE YOUR SAYING THAT NOW IF I WENT TO A HIGH SCHOOL IT WOULD BE A LOT MORE SODAS AND DONNUTS AND I PEETETHE AND GOT PETS AS A VEGETABLE DIDNT YOU KNOW II THEY CLAIM INS A VEGETABLE CONGRESS SAID PIECES OF VEGETABLE AMY CLOBESHAR MADE PETS OF VEGETABLE MAY THEY NEID THEIR EYES BECAUSE THE BIGGEST FROZEN PETS A  A A PRODUCER IS IT MINISTERTA I MN  CAD O VISI VEGETABLE WAS IT WAS A WAS A STRATCH BUT AT LEAST IT IT MADE SENTS ON THE NOVA SYSTEM OF OGOING FROM TOMADO ALL THE WAY TO A TO A CATCH IP TO CAC SINCE HIFOK TOS CORN SURPICE THE PRIMARY INGREDIENT AND CATCH IM INDEED SO THE POINT IS THAT OUR KIDS ARE SUFFERING UNDER THE WAIT THE BURDEN OF THIS CRONIC DISASTER OF ULTRAPROCESS FOOD WHICH IS NOT FOOD AND NO WONDER THER'RE ALL OBISE AND A A A SICK AND I YOU NO DOING SO PRULY IN SCHOOL AND BY THE WAY ALSO DEPRESSED ULTRAPROCESS FOOD HAS NOW BEEN SHOWN IN THREE SEPARATE STUDIES TO CORRELATE WITH DEPRESSION IN TEA NATURES SO WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PROCESS FOOD OR MAYBE WE CALL IT NOVA SYSTEM LEVEL THREE FOUR FOODS AND DEPRESSION ANOTHER PSYCHIATRIC CHALLENGES AND IF YOU COULD YOU SEPARATE OUT METABOLIC CENDRUM FROM OBISITY OM IN ANSWERING THAT LIKE IS THERE'S SOMETHING INHERENTLY DEPRESSING ABOUT CARRYING EXCESS ATAPOST TISSUE A SSETTING SIDE ANY KIND OF AESTHETIC IM A STOFF YOU KNOW O HOW PEOPLE WANT TO LOK OR ARE PERCEIVED YOU KNOW JUST IS THERE ANYTHING BAD ABOUT CARING LOT ABOUT BODY FAT INDEPENDENT OF THE METABOLIC CENDRUM FOR MOODEN AND OVER ALL SENS OF WELL BEING I'M REALLY GLAD TO ASK THAT ANDREM WE SHOULD HAVE ACTUALLY COVERED THIS EARLIER AM EVERYONE THINKS FATIS FAT AS WE'VE LEARNED FAT IS NOT FAT AND A FAT IS NOT A FAT BUT A BODY FAT IS NOT BODY FAT THERE ARE THREE FAT DEPOS AND THEY ARE METABOLICALLY DIFFERENT FIRST IS THE DOES THIS BATHING SUIT MAKE ME LOOK FAT FAT BY THE WAY NEVER ANSWER THAT QUESTION STHAT'S CALLED SUBCUTANEOUS FAT OR BIG BUT FAT IF YOU WILL SO HERE'S THE QUESTION HOW MANY HOUNDS OR KILOS OF SUBCUTANEOUS FAT DO YOU HAVE TO GAIN BEFORE YOU BECOME METABOLICALLY ILL I'M NO IDEA THAT TEN KILOS ABOUT TWENTY TWO POUNDS WHY THE REASON IS BECAUSE THAT SUBCUTANEOUS FAT DRAINS INTO THE SYSTEMIC CIRCULATION SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LOT OF SIDE O KINDS COMING FROM THOSE SUBCUTANEOUS ATAPOSITES TO RAISE THE BLOOD LEVEL OFSIDIC KINDS TO THE POINT WHERE IT STARTS DOING DAMAGE AT THE LEVEL OF THE LIVER SO FATS ARE RELEASING SIDEO KINDS WHICH ARE PROIN FLAMATORY EXACTLY AND THEN THER'RE DOING THAT AT REST ANY FAT SELL ANY FAT SO IANY FATCIL BUT IF IT'S GOING TO THE SYTEMIC CIRCULATION YOU OF A VOLUME OF DISTRIBUTION OF SIX LEADERS SO YOU HAVE TO LOSE YOU HAVE THAT A LOTA SIDE A KINDS TO GET THE CONCENTRATION UP NOW JUST OUT OF FAIRNESS TO THE FAT HOW MANY SID O KINDS DOES A MUSCLE CELL RELEASE I MEAN I ARE WE UNFAIRLY PICKING ON ATAPOST TISSUE CAUS WHY WOULD ATAPOS TISSUE MAK BE PROIN FLAMATORY I MEAN A SINGLE FAT SELL WE OI HAVE GOT A FAT SELLISITTING AT YOU ON MY SHOULDER SOME PLACE RITER I MEAN I'M NOT IS YEUROW FAT AT MY SHOULDER WHY WOULD IT BE PROINEFLAMATORY SO IN FACT THE FAT SELL ITSELF IS NOT HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS THE FAT ELL HAS A FAT VACUAL IT HAS A STORAGE PLACE FOR THIS LIPID DROPLET YOU STUFF IT  STUFF IT STUFF IT THE FAT VACUAL GETS BIGGER BIGGER BIGGER THE PARILYPHE AND BORDER THAT THAT ENCOMPASSES THAT FAT VACUAL THAT BORDERS THE THE IT'S THE SPACE ULTIMATELY CAN'T GET NY BIGGER AND IT STARTS BREAKING DOWN WHEN THAT HAPPENS IT SPILLS THE GREESE INTO THE FAT SELL THE FAT SELL DIES BECOMES NE CRODIC THAT CALLS MACRIPHAGES IN TO CLEAN UP THE GREESE AND IT'S THE MACRIPHAGES THAT RELEASE THE SIDE O KINDS I SO IN FACT THE FAT SELL IS NOT THE PROBLEM IT'S THE BREAK DOWN OF THE GREESE THAT LEA LEADS TO THE MACROPHAGE ACTIVATION THAT'S THE PROBLEM BUT WHEN YOU DO IT IN SUBCUTANEOUS FAT IT'S GOING INTO THE SIX LEADER TANK AND SO THE CONCENTRATION DOESN'T GO VERY MUCH SO TEN KELOS BEFORE YOU START SEEING SOME EFFECT FAT DEPOT NUMBER TOO VICEREL OR BIG BELLY FAT  HOW MANY POUNDS R KILOS OF BIG BELLY FAT TO HAVE TO GAIN BEFORE YOU GET METABALCLEAL I DON'T KNOW BUT I'M GESSING ITS LESS THAN TWENTY TWO IT'S WAYLESS FOR ONCE I GOT ANSWER RIGHT TO  TAT BOT FIVE THAT FIVE POUNDS NOW QUESTIONIS WHY NEMBER ONE THE VICERAL FAT DOES NOT DRAIN INTO THE UPINTO THE SYSTEMAC CIRCULATION IT DRAINS INTO THE PARTAL VEIN WHICH GOES STRAIGHT TO THE LIVER SOU GETTING A BIGGER LOAD GOING STRAIGHT TO THE LIVER OF SIDE O KINDS NOT TO THE KINNEY NOT GOOD THING ABOUT GETTING AN ANSWER WRONG FOLKS AS THEY NEVER FORGET THE CORRECT ANSWERTHAT'S WHAT I ALWAYS THA TELL MYS TENTRI I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT IN THE GOT AND THE QUESTION IS WHAT MADE THE VICERAL FAT IN THE FIRST PLACE WAS IT CALORIES NO IT'S QUARTESAL IT'S STRESS IT'S THE COMBINATION OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND QUARTESAL AND THE REASON WE KNOW THIS IS BECAUS YOU CAN TAKE PATIONS WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER WITH INDOGENOUS DEPRESSION OR SUICIDAL WHO HAVE TO BE ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL TO KEEP THEMSELVES FROM KILLING THEMSELVES STICK THEM IN A SCANNER AND THEY ARE LOSING SUBCUTANEOUS FAT LIKE CRASICRS THERE NOT EATING BUT THEY'RE GAINING VICERAL FAT BECAUSE OF THE HIGH QUARTESOUL ON THE STRESS TO THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE IT DURN A CUORTICUOI TO RECEPTORS IN THAT AREA THAT JUST PREFERENTIALLY DEPO FAT THERE WHEN CORDS ALL'S HIGH INDEED BECAUSE THAT'S THE METABOLICALLY ACTIVE FAT I AND FIVE POUNDS WILL DO IT AND THEN FINALLY THE THIRD FAT DEPOT THE LIVER NOW HOW MANY POUNDS OF FAT CAN THE LIVER STORE BEFORE YOU BECOME METABOLICALLYOL OI GOT A BE EVEN LASBECAUSE THE LIVERS NOT NEARLY AS LARGE AS THE  OBDOMINAL REGION HALF APOUND QUARTERVICUL HOW MUCH IS A HEALTHY LIVER WAY HEALTHY LIVER WAYS FIFTEEN HUNDRED GRAMS SO NO IT'S NOT VERY TRY TRANSLAY QUICKLY TO POUNDS IF WE WE'RE GOING MATRIC WE'RE GOING N AT HE STANDARDSO IFTEEN HUNDRED GRAMS WOULD BE THREE POUNDS SO YOU KNOW ASICALLY HALF APOUND AS NOT VERY MUCH BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE ACTION IS AND SO WHEN YOU HAVE FAT IN YOUR LIVER IT CAUSEIS METABOLIC DIS FUNCTION RIGHT AWAY THE QUESTION'S WHERE DID THAT FAT COME FROM THAT CAME FROM ALKOHOL OR SUGAR SO ALKAL ON SUGAR MOST METABOLICALLY AGGREEGIOUS CAUSE IT AFFECTS THE LIVER DIRECTLY STRESS SECOND MOST BECAUSE IT EFFECTS THE VISRAL FAT AND SUBCUTANEOUS FAT THE LEAST IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF METABOLIC DIRANGEMENT SO YES IT MAY NOT LOOK GOOD IN THE BATHING SUIT BUT FROM A MEABOLIC STANDPOINT IT IS ACTUALLY THE LEAST IMPORTANCE SO THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES ALL RIGHT WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO FIX IF YOUR TRYING TO FIX LIVER FAT IT'S REALLY EASY GET RID OF THE ALKAL ON THE SUGAR EXCEPT OF COURSE THEY' BOTH THE DICTIVE WILL THAT ALSO LIBERATE ANY FAT THAT'S ALREADY IN THE LIVER ABSOLUTELY THT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY INTERMENTN FASTING WORKS IS BECAUSE IT GIVES YOUR LIVER CHANCE TO BASICALLY AWF LOAD WHAT IT'S ALREADY STORT THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT INTERMENT FASTING WILL BUY YOU IS A LITTLE AT A LESS LIVER THAT'S A GOOD THING I NOW STRESS ON THE OTHER HAND AS YOU KNOW AND AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT N AS YOU KNOW YOU'VE HAT DOCTOR LESS APPLE ON YOUR A POTCAST BEFORE YO STRESS IS TOUGH YOU KNOW TRYING TO MITIGATE STRESS ESPECIALLY IN TO DAY'S ENVIRONMENT AND I HOPE YOU'LL INVITE ME BACK SOME TIME TO TALK ABOUT THETHE ROLL OF STRESS ON A THE MIG GLADLY IA AND THEN FINALLY YOU KNOW SUBCUTANEOUS FAT SO WHEN PEOPLE GO ON DIET SWEETNERS WHAT ARE THEY DOING ARE THEY REALLY REDUCING THE FAT THE ANSWER IS NO WAN'T TRI BO ARTIFICIAL SWEETEN OR ITIFICIE DIET SWEETNERS OF ANY SORT YOU CAN PICK YOUR ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER SO A SPAR ERTAAM OR INAO SUCRELO SUCABLE O BE A STEVIE MONG FRUD O A THE NEW ONES YOU KNOWYET THE ONE THAT PEOPLE ARE MORE EXCITE ABOUT NOWADAYS IS AL LO HALL YOUS EXPENSIVE IT TENDS TO HAVE LESS OF AN ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER TASTE THAT PEOPLE CAN DETACT RIGHT OM SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT REGARDLESS OF OH AND WE SHOULD  I'M REMEMBERING FROM THE COMMENT SECTION I DO READ THEM ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERS AN NON COLORIC SWEET NURSE YES BECAUSE AN WHEN THE MOMMY SAY ARTIFICIAL PEOPLE SAY WHAT ABOUT STEVIA WHAT ABOUT ALLO SO SOLEST US SAY OM A NONE COLORIC SWEETNURSE CAN WRAP OUR ARMS ROUND ALL THAT ENTIRE CATEGORY UNLESS WE NEED TO DISTINGUISH AMONG THE DIFFERENT PARTICIPANTS IN THAT CATEGORY SEE YOU'RE SAYING THAT EVEN THOUGH PEOPLE CAN OM LOWER THERE TOTAL CLOR CAN TAKE PRETTY EFFECTIVELY I'VE SEEN THE STUDIES THAT SHOW OF YOU DETERS WHO CONSUME O WATER ONE LY IS THERE YOU KNOW MAIN LIQUAT VERSIS DIET SO DOS WITH ASPERTAM TYPICALLY OR STEVIA THE DIET SODA DRINKERS ACTUALLY LOSE MORE WEIGHT BUT WEWE KNOW THAT BUT YOURE SAYING THERE MAY BE DEPOSITION OF FAT IN THE LIVER IN THOSE INDIVIDUALS BE SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OF THE ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER BECAUSE OF THE INSOLENT TURNS OUT THEIRE STILL AN INSOLENT RESPONSE SO THER VERY FAMOUS STUDY DONE IN A COPENHAGAN A HUNDRED NORMAL INDIVIDUALS TWENTY FIVE IN FOUR DIFFERENT GROUPS ONE GROUP AONE SOF ONE LEADER OF SUGAR SOTA PER DAY FOR SIX MONTHS ONE LEADER THAT'S A LAST SUGART SO YET ONE GROUP ONE LEADER OF DIASOTA PER DAY FOR SIX MONHS I PRIDE TO THAT IN GRADUAS ONE GROUP ONE LEADER OF MILK PER DAY FOR SIX MONTHS  PRIDE TO THAT WHEN I WAS AN INFANT AND FINALLY ONE FINAL GROUP ONE LEADER OF WATE PER DAY FOR SIX MONTHS I DO THAT NOW I DO MORE THAN THAT BUT YA THE ONE LEADER OF SODA PER DAY IN SIX MONTHS GAIN TEN KILASTHE SUGARY SOTA E SUGAR SO TEN KILAS CACULAS NO SURPRISE THE ONE LEADER OF WATER PER DAY LOST TUKULAS ALSO NO SURPRISE THOSE WERE THE EASY ONES NOWITS DO THE ONES IN THE MIDDLE ONE LEADER OF MILK PER DAY NO CHANGE PERS ONLY THAT WAS FULL FAT MILK I BAA GEURO FULL FAMILY THEY LIKE THERE THE THAT BO FAT MILLNO CHANGE WHY IS THAT THERE TAKING ON AN ENORMOUS INCREASE IN TOTAL COLORI CAN TAKE I'M GUESSING THAT THE S A BLUNTED IN CYLEN RESPONSE DUE TO THE FAT IN THE MILK AND ALSO BECAUSE LACTOSE IS NOT A VERY A A BIG DRIVER OF INSOLENT RESPONSE AND BECAUSE THEIS AS SATIDY EFFECT THAT'S LIKE THE EAT LESS LIKE FO LIKE FOOD AND FINALLY THE KEY THE KICKER R TO THE WHOLE THING DIET SO THE ONE LEADE OF DIE SER WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU PREDICT THEIR WEIGHT WOULD DO MORE WEIGHT LOST THAN IN THE WATER GROUP BASED ON MY UNDERSTANDING THE LITERATURE THEY GAIN TWO KILOS ILD BECAUSE THEY EATE MAR WELL YOU TELL ME WHY DID THEY GAIN TO KILOS IF THEY WERE CONSUMING THE LEADER OF DIET SODA WHICH ARE ZERO CALERIES THE INSWERS BECAUSE THEY STILL GENERATED AN INSOLENT RESPONSE AND THAT INSOLENT RESPONSE GENERATED MORE HUNGER MORE MORE WEIGHT AND MORE HUNGER EXACTLY AND THAT'S THE KEY SO THEY DIDN'T GAIN THE TEN KILOS THEY GAIN TO KILOS SO IT LOOKS BETTER COMPARED TO THE SUGAR A A VERSION BUT IT LOOKS LIKE YOU KNOW A PROBLEM COMPARED TO THE WATER VERSION OR EVEN THE MILK VERSION SO UNLESS YOU BOOTS TRAP CALERIES AND HOLD THAT CONSTANT YOU'RE GINTO SEE AWEIGHT GAIN TU TO ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERING EXACTLY RIGHT AND THAT'S BEEN SHOWN FIFTY WAYS FROM SUNDAY AT A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT STUDIES SO COMPARED TO SUGAR YE AT'S BETTER BUT COMPARED TO WATER IT'S WAY WORSE AND THE REASON IS THE INSOLENT RESPONSE YOU PUT SOMETHING SWEET ON THE TONGUE MESSAGE GOES TONGUE TO BRAIN SUGAR'S COMING MESSAGE GOES BRAIN TO PANKRES THROUGH THE BAGUEST NERVE SUGAR'S COMING RELEASE THE INSOLENT AND SO TONGUE DOESN'T KNOW IF ITS SUGAR OR NOT IT RELEASES THE INDS THAT PANCRIS RELEASES THE INSOLENT WHICH DRIVES ENERGY INTO FAT WHETHER IT WAS ENOUGH FROM THE A DIET SWEETE OR NOT I I SAW SOME REALLY INTERESTING DATA FROM DANA SMALLS CROUP AT YALE UP SHOWING THAT WHEN PEOPLE HAVE A DIET SODA WITH FOOD SAYS LIKE THE DIECOKUE WITH THE SAN WICER WITH THE BURGER MAY BEN WITH THE POSSTA THE INSOLENT RESPONSE FROM THE FOOD AND THE INSOLENT RESPONSE FROM THE DIET SODA ARE COMPOUNDED BUT THERE'S A CLASSICAL CONDITIONING EFFECT PAVALOVIAN EFFECT SUCH THAT THAN LATER IF THEY JUST DRINK THE DIET SODA THEY GET AN EVEN BIGGER INSOLENT RESPONSE JUST TO THE DIET SOTA THAN THEY WOULD HAVE ORIGINALLY IF THEY ONLY HAVE THE DIET SOTA SEPARATE FROM FOOD SO ANOTHER WORDS THE THE INSOLENT THE FOOD INDUCED INSOLENT RESPONSE IS CONDITIONING A GREATER INSOLENT RESPONSE FROM THE DIET SODA AND WE ACT TOULD HAVE ANOTHER STUDY THAT DEMONSTRATES THE SAME THING OUT OF SINGAPOR A TAY AT ALL A IN MERICONJERNAL CLINICAL NUTRICIAN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN I BELIEVE THAT LOOKED AT A SIMILAR PARADINE HERE'S WHAT THEY DID THEY TOOK A BUNCH OF PEOPLE AND THEY ADMITTED THEM TO THEIR CLINICAL R SEARCH CENTER FOR TIMES A WEEK APART AND THEY DID AVE BEN RANDOM MORDER AND EACH TIME THEY A STARTED THE MORNING THET FASTING AND THEY DID EITHER A SUCROS TOLERANCE TEST OR AN A SPARTAME TOLERANCE TEST OR SUCRELOS TOLERANCE TEST OR A MONK FRUIT TOLERANTE TEST SO TWO HOURS YOU KNOW IN JESTING ONE OF THE THR ONE OF THE FOUR AND MEASURING GLUCOSAN INSOLENT OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT TWO HOURS FASTED FASTED THEN IT WAS TIME FOR LUNCH AND THEY LET THEM HAVE WHATEVER LUNCH THEY WANT IT WAS A METABOLIC BUFFET THEY COULD EAT WHATEVER THEY WANTED OFF THE BUFFET EXCEPT THAT THEY WERE N BEING CLOCKED AND THE SAME FOR DINNER THEY'RE BEING CLUCKED BUT THEY COULD EAT WHATEVER THEY WANT ANY GIVEN PERIOD OF TIME IN THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS THEYWERE N FROM SEVEN A M TO SEVEN P M WHENEVER THEY WENT HOME  TURND OUT THEY SU CROS TALENTS TS GENERATED AN IN SOLENT RESPONSE AS YOU'D EXPECT THEY MON FRUIT THE STIT THE BEA A A SUCROLOS AND THE ESPORTAME DID NOT BUT THEN WHEN THEY ATE LUNCH THEY IF THEY HAD ONE OF THE THREE DIET SWEETENERS IN THE MORNING THEY ATE MORE AT LUNCH AND MORE AT DINNER AND GENERATED AN INCREASED INSOLENT RESPONSE BOTH AT LUNCH AND DINNER SO THAT THE AREA UNDER THE CURF OF THE WHOLE DAY WAS EXACTLY THE SAME SO THEY EAT A SIG SIGNIFICANTLY MORE YE BECAUSE THEY HAD THE DIET SOTA IN THE MORNING WILE WELL I DRINKDRINKS THAT CONTAIND STEVIA AND I DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT TOO MUCH BUT WHAT YOU'R SAYING IS EVEN IF I WOULDS STRAP MY CALORIES THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT THE INSOLENT RESPONSE COULD HAVE DIRECT EF FACTS ON THE LIVER EXACTLY RIGHT AND NOT FOR THE BETTER AND NOT FOR THE BETTER NOW HAVING SAID THAT A WE HAVE UNDERTAKN AN INTERESTING PROJECT WHICH I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW ABOUT A IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY DURING THE PANDEMIC I WAS APPROACHED BY A FOOD COMPANY IN THE MIDDLE EAST COLD QUATY DANISH DAIRY COMPANY KATY DY IT'S THE NESTLY OF THE MATDLEAST NOW THEY MAKE ALL SORTS OF JUMP FROZEN YOGER FLAVORED MILKS I SCREAM CONFECTIONARY BISCUITS TOMATE O SAUS E QUAITE HAS AN EIGHTEEN PER CENT DIABEDE'S RATE AND AN EIGHTY PER CENT OBE ITTY RATE EIG ZEREIGT ZERO WY IN THE ADULTS I NOW THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED THAT THEY WANTED TO BE A METABOLICALLY HEALTHY COMPANY AND THEY KNEW THEY WEREN'T THEY CONTACT TO ME AND SAID WOULD YOU PUT TOGETHER SCIENTIFIC ADBYES RETEME TO ADVISE US WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO CHANGE THE FOOD IN ORDER TO BE A METABOLICALLY HEALTHY COMPANY AND WE WANT A LEAD AND I SAID WELD BE HA I'D BE HAPPY TO DO THAT WITH ONE PROVIS O WE GET THO PUBLISH WHAT WE DID SO THAT IY CAN SERVE AS A ROAD MAP FOR THE REST OF THE FOOD IN THE STREEM THEY SAID FINE AND SO I CONVENED ON SCIENTIFIC ADBYES RETAM MY COLLEGUBLE FROM OLDER SIN WHO RESTORTED THE VERY FIRST FARMERS MARKET IN LOSANGELIS AND IS NOW ACTUALLY THE DIRECTOR F SUSTAINABILITY NUTRITION FOR KATY DY A A TEMPARLIN WHO IS THE HEAD OF CULINARY MEDICINE A GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY RACHEL GAW WHO IS A FATIACID EXPERT WHO RAN THE LL MAKE A THREE FOR EGHD D TRIAL AT THE ANNI AH AND ANDREAS CORNCHTOT WHOS ACTUALLY A COMPUTER SCIENTIST FROM STANFORD AND WE BASICALLY STRIPPED DOWN EVERY SINGLE THING THAT KATY DY DID IN TERMS OF PROCUREMENT IN TERMS OF INGREDIENTS IN TERMS OF PACKAGING WE SUBMITTED EVERY SINGLE INGREDIENT TO BUILE CHEMICAL ANALYSIS WE CAUSE YOU COULDN'T TRUST WHAT THE VENDERS WERE BASICALLY TELLING KATY DY WAS IN THE FOOD WE HAD HAD TO ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT WAS IN THE FOOD THAT WAS A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS WILL BY ITSELF I MEAN THIS WAS NOT A CHEAP LITTLEYOU KNOWAVESOJOURN INTO THE WOODS THIS WAS A BIG DEAL WE BASICALY RE ENGINEERED THEYRE ENTIRE ONE HUNDRED EIGD ITEM PORTFOLIO AND THEY AVE NOW TURNED OVER TEN PER CENT OF THEIR PRODUCTS TO BE METABOLICALLY HEALTHY AND THE PRECEPTS THAT WE SET IN THIS PAPER WHICH IS IN FRONTIERS IN NUTRITION IN MARCH OF THIS YERE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE THRETHINGS THREE PRINCIPLES IF YOU ADHERE TO THESE THREE PRINCIPLES YOU CAN TURN ANY FOOD HEALTHY INCLUDING ULTRAPROCESS FOOD NUMBER ONE PROTECT THE LIVER NUMBER TWO FEED THE GUT NUMBER THREE SUPPORT THE BRAIN IF YOU HAVE A FOOD THAT DOES ALL THREE OF THOSE IT IS HEALTHY IF YOU HAVE A FOOD THAT DOES NONE OF THOSE THREE THEN IT'S POISON BECAUSE I'S N OUGH FOOD INSANT I ALWAS CON SAY IT DOESN'T UNLIKE FLOVO THAT IS THE RIGHT UM THE RIGHT DESCRIPTOR IN THAT CASE EXACTLY AND IF IT'S DOES ONE OR TWO BUT NOT ALL THREE THENE CAN BE SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN SO THE GOAL WAS TO TAKE ALL OF KATYDY'S PRODUCTS AND MOVE THEM FROM YOU KNOW THE LOWEST HERE UP TO THE HIGHEST HERE BY ADHERING TO THESE THREE PRINCIPLES AND WE CAME UP WITH SOME VERY SIMPLE THINGS NUMBER ONE GOT TO GET RID OF THE SUGAR NUMBER TWO GOT A AD FIBER NUMBER THREE GOT O ATAM MAKE A THREES NUBER FOUR GOT A DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE AMULSIFIERS CAUSE THE MULSIFIERS ARE CAUSING THE GOT INFLAMMATION BECAUSE AFTER ALL MULSIFIERS IN NUTRURGENTS THEY HOLD FAT IN WATER TOGETHER THEY BURN A WHOLE THE MUSIN LERE SO THEY'RE ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTING TO THAT GOOD INFLAMMATION AND MULSIFIERS ARE IN STREAM THROUGHOUT ULTRAPROCESS FOOD TEM WEVE HEARD ABOUT HIDDEN SUGARS E LOT IM DRINK TO DAY'S EPISODE AND ELSEWHERE BUT BASED ON EVERYTHING TOLD US OF BOUT ARTIFICIALS EXCUSE ME LOW CALLORYS SWEET NURSE AM IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO ME NOW WHY FOODS THAT ARE NOT TOWDED AS DIET FOODS WOULD BE LACED WITH THINGS LIKE SUKERLOS BECAUSE IT SHOULD DRIVE THE CRAVING FOR THAT FOOD THROUGH INCREASES AN INSOLEN AND CRAVING OF OTHER FOODS LATER THAT DAY AND LATER THAT EVENING IS THAT WHY NON CLERK SWEETNERS ARE ADDED TO ALL SORTS OF FOODS NOW THAT BECAUSE TIMICALLY ONE THINGS NON CLERK SWEETNERS PROBABLY ONLY ADDED TO CONCODIET FOODS LOWCALORY FOODS BUT THAT'S NOT THIT'S THERE O YOUR RIS IT'S THAT THAT'S NOT THE CASE AND THEY ARE ADDING THATIT'S WAT DIE SWEETNERS TO FOODS THAT YOU DID KNOW HOW THAI SWEETNERS IN IM THAT'S RIGHT UM THEREARE TWO REASONS THAT THIS HAPPENS ONE IS INSOLENT BECAUSE INSOLENT BLOCKS LEPT IN SIGNALING AT THE LEVEL OF THE HYPOTHELEMUS AND THE NEWKLY SECCUMBENCE SO WITH THE BLOCK SLEPT AND LEPTON IS THE HORMON THAT YOUR FETSILS MAKE THAT TELLS YOU BRAIN YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH SO IF INSOLENT BLOCK SLEPT IN IT MAKES YOU HUNGRIER AND IT ALSO EXTINGUISHES IT STOPS THE EXTINGUISHING OF REWARD BY THAT FOOD SO THAT YOU WANT MORE OF IT SO IT DOES BOTH BECAUS LEPT AN NORMALLY SUPPRESSES FOOD AND TAKE AND REDUCES CRAVING THE ANALOGY THAT COMES TO MIND IS UM A SLOT MACHINE THAT ENCOURAGES YOU TO FEED MORE MONEY AND HIT GO TO PULL THE LEVER BUT IT ALL SO BLINDS YOU TO THE OUTCOME SO EVEN IF YOU WIN YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT YOU HAVE WINDS IT'S ALLSO BLINDING YOU TO YOUR LOSSES YOU'R EFFECTIVELY BECOMING A A TOMATON  OF JUST EATING WITHOUT ANY UM UM CONSCIOUS UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT YOU'R YOU'R BRINGING IN OR TASTING THE FOOD ANY LONGER EXACT RIGHT IT'S NOT THIS LIKE AN ONOLEMKI WHEN SHE CAME ON THE POTCAST A AUTHOR OF DOPENMING NATION AND NOVIS AHEAD OF AR A DUL DIE NOTS IS A DICTION CLENNING ENE TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW THESE THESE A CONSUMPTIVE BEHAVIORS WHERE THER SCROLLING SOCIAL MEETIN ARE CONSUMING PORN OR A CONSUMING DRUGS ARE OU CALL IN A WAY THAT LIKE THEY'RE NOT IN TOUCH WITH THE PLEASURE OF OF THE SUBSTANCE OR BEHAVIOUR ANY MORE THEY BECOME ATOMATONS BUT THEY BUT IF THEY DON'T DO IT THEY FEEL LOUSY SO THE PLEASURE IS GONE THE PAIN ANS DEAFONLY TO WAITING TOLERANCE IN DEPENDENCE THAT'S THE DEFINITION OF EDICTION SO DOPEME ISN'T EXCITATORY NARROW TRANSMITTER IT EXCITES THE NEXT NERON ALWAYS THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS DOPEMIN ENHIBITING A POSTNAPTIC NERO DOPEMIN STIMULATES THE NEXT NERON AND IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH DOPEMIN RECEPTOR IT IS ONE THROUGH FIVE IT'S ALWAYS EXCIDATORY NOW THERINS LIKE TO BE EXCITED THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE RECEPTORS BUT TERE IS LIKE TO BE TICKLED NOT BLUDGEONS CHRONIC OVER STIMULATION OF ANY NURON AND YOU KNOW THIS LEADS TO NEURONAL SELL DEATH AND THE REASON IS BECAUSE THE NURON NEEDS ENERGY THE NURON IS THE MOST ENERGY DEPENDENT A TISSUE IN THE BODY IT NEEDS THOSE MIGHTA CONJURY IT TO BE PUMPING OUT EIGHT P LIKE CRAZY TO ENGAGE IND NERV TRANSMISSION WELL WHEN YOUARE FIRING NON STOP YOU RISK SELLD ES SO THE THEXCITATORY NURON THATTHE PUSSINATIC NORANT HAS A PLAN BE IT DOWN REGULATES THE RECEPTOR IT DOWN REGULATES THE DOPE ME INERECEPTOR SO THERE'S LESS CHANCE THAT ANY STRAIGTD OPENING MOLECULE WILL FIND A RECEPTOR TO BYING TO AND THIS IS ITS PLAN BE IN ORDER TO TRY TO MITIGATE THE RISK OF DYING WELL WHAT IS TAT MEAN IN HUMAN TERMS IT MEANS YOU GET A HIT YOU GET A RUSH RECEPTORS GO DOWN NEXT TIME YOU NEED A BIGGER HIT TO GET THE SAME RUSH I RECEPTORS GOT DOWN INEED A BIGER HIT A BGGER HIT A BIGGER HIT UNTILL FINALLY NEED A HUGIT TO GET NOTHING THAT'S COL TOLERANCE AND THEN WHEN THE NORNS DO START TO DIE THAT'S COLD ADDICTION THAT'S WHAT WE'VE GOT AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED IN TERMS OF FOOD EDDICTION SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT'S A DICTIVE IS FAT EDICTIVE NO CAUSE IF FAT WAS ADDICTIVE THAN OLL THE PEOPLE ON THE ATKINS DIET OR ON THE KUTOJENICTI E WOULD BE GAINING WEIGHT NOT LOSING IT AND I'D BE CRAVING REBISE ALL DAY I LIKE O REVIVE PRETTY OFTEN ACTUALLY BUT I KNOW I KNOW PEOPLE SAY NO BUT E LIT MY LIPITS ARE IN IN LINE AND I I DON'T EANT MANY STARCHES AN I CERTAINLY AVOID SUGAR ALTHOUGH NOW I'M THINKING I MIGHT WANT TO REALLY REDUCE MY A LOCALERIE A SWEETNER IN TAKE I DON'T SEE MYSELF REDUCING MY STEVIA AND TAKE TO ZERO CAUSE IT'S IN SOMETHINGS I REALLY LIKE ENDRE I AM NOT THE FOOT POLICE A YOU KNOW OWI WAYS SAY THAT YOUARE NOT A COP BUT DAM WHY BUT BUT DATE OUR DATAD AND AND HALTH DATE ARE THE THE IT  DAYTO SAY THAT IF THAT'S NOT HELPIN YOU ANY THAT'S WITH THE DAT O SAY A POINT IS THAT THE AT'S NOT THE PROBLEM THE SALT'S NOT THE PROBLEM THE CAFINES A PROBLEM REALAFINES HE CLASSIC A DICTIVE CEPTIONS AN Y LEVEL YABUT A OTERS AVILE PROBLEBUT IF IF ONE CAN CUT OUT CAFING BY THE EARLY AFTERNOON OR EVEN SOONER IN THE DAY AND IT'S NOT CONSUMED TO ACCESS AM AND IT'S IN THE FORMER COFFEE YOUR BAMATE SOME OTHER FORM THAT'S HEALFY YOU KNOW IS IT REALLY THAT MUCH OF A PROBLEM A I LOVE COFFEE O YOU NEAT TONTTHAT'S MY EDICTION LIKE WITH A CAPITAL ELL UNDERLINE BOLD FACE I  I I I I FEEL YOUR PAIN AND THE ANSWER IS NO ONE HAS SHOWN THAT CLOFFEE IS TOXIC IT IS ADDICTIVE BUT IT'S NOT TOXIC NOW IF YOU MIX THE COFFEE WITH ALCOHOLE I GOT FOR LOCO NOW IT'S TOXIC BUT INNIT OF ITSSELF CAFINE IS NOT A TOXIC AND THAT'S WHY THERE'S A STARBOX ON EVERY STREET QORNER BUT IT IS HIGHLY REINFORCING I DIDN'T EPOSET ON CAFINE WIT OM COVERED SOME DATA THAT WAS PUBLISHING THE JOURNAL SCIENCE ONE OF THREE APEC JOURNALS AM AND IF YOU PUT KAFEN UNBEKNOWS TO THE CONSUMER INTO PLAIN YOGERT PEOPLE WILL CRAVE PLAIN YOGER IN THE MUCH MORE I MEAN PEOPLE LIKE THE FEELING OF BEING CAFANY AS LONGS AS NOT CREATING ANXIETY LEVELS OF ENERGY EXAT ON I'M ANISTIC WITH CAFING THAT'S FIN YAN SO LI WE'VE BEENTELL YOU ALOVID ABOUT THE HYPOTHALEMIS AS WELL AS SOME PRIFERAL GOT BASE MECHANISMS FOR HUNGER AND SATIEDY I THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE GEOP ONE AGONISTS THAT ARE NOW IM WIDELY USE SO THING IT T TYPICALLY CALL THOSE AMPIC BUT GEOP ONE WOOG ON LIKE PEPTITE ONE I'M ORIGINALLY DISCOVERED IN THE HELA MONSTER WHICH EATS VERY SELDOM AND SOME REALLY SMART BIOLOGIST TAT LA BIOLOGY LIKE THIS SAT HOW COME THEY DON'T HAVE TO EAT VERY MUCH WILL THEY HAV THEIR BLOOD IS LOADED WITH GOP ONE IM AND SO THEY ONLY HAVE TO ONE WHATEVER HEELA MONSTERS UM DELIGHT IN PER YEAR OR SOMETHING OUTRAGEOUS LIKE THAT HUMANS MAKE COP ONE WELL MINOR STANDING IS THAT GO P ONE THAT THAT NOT THAT'S INJECTED BUT THAT ONE I MAKES NATURALLY IS ACTING ON BOTH THE BRAIN AND THE GOT TO INCREASE TE TIEDY SO IS ACTING ON THE BRAIN ARGUMENT BUT THE PRIMARY ACTION IS ONTY G GO P ONE DECREASES THE RATE OF GASTRIC EMPTY THAT IS IT'S PRIMARY DRIVER YES IT DOES AFFECT THE BRAININ THAT ARGUING THAT IT DOES BUT THE PRIMARY EFFECT IS TO REDUCE THE RATE OF GASTRIC EMPTYNG SO YOU STAY FULLER LONGER BECAUSE THE FOOD DOESN'T MOVE THROUGH THE STOMACH IN THE INTESTIN INTRETING INSOUTH A MESI CAS IN A REGUINE ARGENTIN IS LONG THOUGHT THAT I YOURE BAMOTE  CONSUMPTION WHICH WE KNOW VERY MODESTLY INCREASE IS GOP ONE AND BY THE WAY A LOT OF OTHER THINGS DUE TO IM THAT PEOPLE WERE TAKING IT FOR ITS OF AFTER MEALS FOR ITS LAXITIVE OF FACT PARSHLY B THAT'S YO PLEASANT FU BUT THAT'S THAT'S A THT OT THE COLDAN THAT'S A THE MI H GON RATR BET STOMAC BUT IT IS USE FAIRLY EFFECTIVELY FOR PEOPLE TO SPACE THEIR MEALS WITHOUT SNACKING THAT EUR THEU KNOW AND MAYBE ITS THA GO P ONE MAY BE T SOMETHING ELSE M BUT PEOPLE ARE INJECTING THEMSELVES WITH GOP ONE ANALOGUES NOW N ATS CERTAINTHING NO E OLOS O MONTH YES HAT WHAT IT COSTS THAT'S WHT  CLOSS RIGHT NON AND IT SEEMS TO BE PRETTY EFFECTIVE AT INDUCING WEIGHT LOSS ALTHOUGH A SIGNIFICANT MOUND THAT WAY LOST SEEMS TO BE FROM A SKILTA MUSCLE TISSUE AND WE'RE ME TO TALK ABOUTS AND SO WHATARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON ASAMPIC AS AS A PRIMARY I EARLY YOU TALKED ABOUT PRIMARY AND SECONDARY CONTROL I Y U REFER TO IT A WILL BUT DIFFERENTLY IN THE CONTECTS OF STATINS IM SO E KID COMES IN HIS OBES OR SLIGHTLY OVER WEIGHT  AS LIKE  I WON'T NOUGT TO DO I'M TRY ING EAT BETTER EXERCISE OR A PERSON COMES IN SAYS HEY AV I'VE HAD A REALLY HARD TIME GETTING THAT LAST TWENTY A NINE POUNDS OFF FOR SO MANY YEARS WILL YOU PRESCRIBING OS EMPIC SO THE SURT IN SR IS NUMBER ONE I'M RETIRED SO NOT TO PRESCRIBE IN ANYTHING BUT LET'S LE LET LET'S LET'S GO WITHTHER THE DATA SHO THAT GEELPE ONE ANALOGUES LIKE  SEMIGLUTIDE AND NOW TERSEPITIDE WHICH IS A LILY'S VRSION AMONGORO IS THE DIABEDES VERSION ZEP BOUND IS THE OBISITY VERSION ON SAME WAY THAT OSEMPIC IS THE DIABEDES VERSION FOR A A NOVONORTOS AND WE GOVI IS THE OBISITY VERSION SO THEY'RE ALL GELP PE ONE R ALLGI HEKS TE GOPY ONE ATLER SYMTHESIZE IN A LAB IT LOOKS LIKE GEOP HE ONCE MELLS I GEOPE WHENT AXI GOPE ONE WHEN INJECTED TERE'S EPITIDE THE A LILY ONE ACTUALLY HAS A DUEL FUNCTION IT A BINDS TO THE G I P RECEPTOR SO MIGHT HAVE DOUBLE DUTY AND THE DATA SHOW THAT IT'S ACTUALLY EVEN SLIGHTLY MORE EFFECTIVE AT WEIGHT LOSS THAN THE NOVONORTOS VERSION SO WILL BE SEEING A SHIFT IN TERMS OF A A CONSUMER PREFERENCE SOON NO DOUBT BUT HERE'S THE THING YOU LOOK AT THE DATA ONE YEAR AA TREATMENT SIXTEEN PER CENT WEIGHT LOSS AND THAT SOUNDS GREAT AND ON THE SAME AS BAD AND GOODEOPLE ARE NOT CRAVING FOOD ALL THE TIME IS THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE FEELING FULL LONGER RIGHT S THE'RE EATING LESS THEYRE EATING LESS TAN TIS A GALLERY AN CALORY OUT MODEL THEYRE EATING LESS AND SO THEY ARE LOSING WEIGHT IM NOT ARGUING THAT AND THEY MIGHT BE CRAVING ALCOHOL LASS ACCORDING TO SOME REASON YES YE WE WEWE CAN GO THERE FOR A MINUTE TOO IN A SECOND HERE'S A PROBA WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT SIXTEEN PER CENT WEIGT LOSS AS YOU JUST SAID WHEN YOU PUT PEOPLE IN A DEXA SCANNER THEY HAVE LOST EQUAL AMOUNTS OF FAT AND MUSCL IS A GOOD TO LOSE MUSCLE IT IS NOT GOOD ASK ANY LITTLE OLD LAD WHO BREAKS ER HIP IF SHE WISH SHE SHE HAD A LITTLE BIT MORE MUSCLE OR SOMEBODY WHO DIED AT LOST A LOT OF MUSSLE CAUSE THEY WEREN'T OFFSETTING THE WEIGHT LOSS WITH RESISTANCE TRAINING OR SOME OTHER FORM OF EXERCISE AND THE AMOUNT OF FOOD THAT THEY CAN EAT IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THAT WEIGHT TO PUT IT IN SCIENTIFIC TERMS SOCKS AND YOU KNOW WE MENTIONE PETER A TEA EARLIER KE IN OUT LIVE HE'S MADE AT VERY CLEAR THAT SARCOPENIA LACK OF MUSCLE MASS IS ONE OF THE DRIVERS OF MORTALITY SO LOSING MUSCLE IS NOT A A A A GOOD IDEA BUT YOU LOSE EQUAL AMOUNTS OF FAT MUSCL WHAT ELSE CAUSES LOSS OF EQUAL AMOUNTS OF FAT AND MUSCLE STARVATION IN FACT THE REASON THAT ALL THESE GEOPE ONE ANALOGUES WORK IS BECAUSE YOU STOP EATING LIKE THE ILT ARMATION YE JUST LIKE THE OMUSSLE THE OLMOSSERS A GREE CHALBY TO ME WELL ASK ANOTHER HELOMONSTER BUT UNFORTUNATELY WHATEVER ANSWER IT PROVIDED WASN'T NOT INUNVE THE POINT IS THAT STARVATION IS NOT SO GOOD AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHY IT'S WORKING DIT'S REDUCING GASTRIC THE RATE OF GASTRIC EMPTYING I WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT THAT'S THE REASON FOR ITS SIDE EFFECTS THE REDUCTION IN GASTRIC EMPTYING THATS WHY YOU GET NAUSIA THAT'S WHY YOU GIVE VOMITING THAT'S WHY YOU GET PANCRETITIS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY NOW GASTRO PARISIS YOUR STOMACH TURNS TO STONE AND YOU CAN'T MOVE ANY FOOD THROUGH YOUR INTESTAN AT ALL AND WORSE YET WHEN YOU STOP THE MEDICINE THE GASTRAPARISIS DOESN'T GET BETTER THIS IS NOT A GOOD IDEA THIS IS LIKE THE OPPOSITE OF THE EUR BROMAANDIOUST EFFECT WHICH HAS A SORT OF PROLAXIVE GASTRIC EMPTYING MAYBE JELPE ONE AGONISM GASH OKE SO IT'S OBVIOUS WHY PEOPLE WHO'VE STRUGGLE TO LOSE WEIGHT LIKE IT ESPECIALLY IF THEIR STRUGGLE TO LOSE WEIGHT WAS AT LEAST IN THEIR MIND THE CONSEQUENCE OF BEING HUNGRY ALL THE TIME AND NEEDING TO EOR OR WAS IT BECAUSE OF THE REWARD AND THE YOU KNOW THEIR DEPENDENTS BECAUSE IN FACT YES A A A THE'S GIOPIONE ANALOGUES REDUCE REWARD AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THEY'VE NOTICE THAT OU N THING A A REDUCTION IN ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION A AS WELL AND THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD THING EXCEPT THE'RE ALSO NUMEROUS CASES NOW OF MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER IN RESPONSE TO THESE DRGS AT'S ALLTHING NOW TRECTS ON OR SOMETHING FOR THE TREATMENT OF ADDICTION WELL YOU AN SOMETIMES CAN BE USEFUL BUT NOW BUT THE YOUR ATTEMPTING TO REMOVE THE THE AM THE AMPLITUDE OF THAT REWARD SIGNAL I'M AN A LOT ON PAPER IT MAKE SANSE BUT THE BUT IT DOESN'T ALWAYS AN A HACIS IT DOESN'T PLAY OUT THAT'S RIGHT AND SO I'M OIN A REFER YOU NOW TO A AN OLD A LITERATURE THAT A WAS FROM TWO THOUSAND SIX THERE WAS A DRUG THAT WAS APPROVED IN EUROPE CALLED ROMONABANT KATE A TRATE NAME ACCOMPLIU AND WAS APPROVED IN A EUROPE FOR WEIGHTLOSS AND IT WAS PRETTY GOOD AT WEIGHTLOSS CAUSED ABOUT TWENTY PER CENT WEIGHTLOSS IT ALSO CAUSE SEVERE DEPRESSION AND TWENTY ONE SUICIDES SO IT'S NO LONGER AVAILABLE BECAUSE IT WAS THE END YET IT WAS PULLED FROM THE EUROPEAN MARKET NEVER APPROVED IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE REASON THIS HAPPENEDAS BECAUSE THIS WAS THE ANTIE MARAWANA DRUG THIS WAS THE ANTIME MONCHIES DRUG THIS WAS AN ENDO CANABONOID ANTAGONIST WELL WHEN YOU REDUCE REWARD YOU ALSO REDUCE YOUR DESIRE TO LIVE AND THAT'S WHY THIS CONCERN ABOUT REDUCTION AN ALCA CONSUMPTION WE'VE ALREADY SEEN MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER IN PATIENCE RECEIVING OSEMPIC SO ARE WE GOING TO SEE THE SAME THING PLAY OUT AS WE DID FOR ROMANABANT I'M WORRIED ABOUT IT OR ENFEN WELL FENFEN DIDN'T HAVE A A NE CARDIA IT WAS CARDIA Y WEAD CRI K PROBLEMS AF DUE TO THE FIN FLURMINE BECAUSE OF THE U SIRTONE OF ONE BE RECEPTER A AGANIS RIGHT I'M JUST REFERRING TO THE FACT THAT THESE THESE QUOTIQUAT BLOCK BUSTERR DRUGS FOR A B CITY THEY TEND TO FOLLOW A CONTUR OF YOU KNOW VERY PROMISING VERY EXCITING LOT OF PEOPLE LOSING WEIGHT SUTICIDES ARE VERY PROMISING LOTOF PEOPLE LOSING WEIGHT AM CARDIACCURSUTES VERY PROMISING LOSING WEIGHT AND NOW YOURE SAYING THE STOMACH TURNS TO STONE SOUND IT SOUND SO BIBLICAL A WELL INDEED SO THAT'S THE QUESTION AND THEN FINALLY WE CAN REALLY TALK BIBLICAL IF EVERYONE IN AMERICA WHO QUALIFIED FOR OS AN P GOT IT THAT WOULD BE TWO POINT ONE SHRILLION TO THE HCAR SYSTEM WHICH IS CUNLLY AT FOURPOINT ONE TRILLION SOW BE A GREATER THAN FIFTY PER CENT INCREASE IN HEALTH CAR CLOSS K HAS THIRTEEN HUNDRED A MONTHS CONVERSELY IF WE JUST GOT SUGAR CONSUMPTION DOWN TO UST A GIDLINES BY BASICALLY YOU KNO PUTTING SOME LIMITS ON HOW MUCH ADDED SUGAR THE FOOT IN THE STREE CAN PUT INTO ANY GIVEN PRODUCT LIKE FRUIT LOOPS WE COULD REDUCE WEIGHT BY TWENTY NINE PER CENTS AND SAVE THREE POIN ZERO TRILLION DOLLARS SO WE'D GET BETTER WEIGHT LOSTS AND WE'D SAVE FIVE POINT ONE THRILLION DOLLARS WHICH MAKES MORE CENTS TO THE US GOVERNMENT WELL EARLY ARE YOU ARE ALLUDING TO GOVERNMENT A BIG FOOD BIG FARM A RELATIONSHIPS HAVING THERE'S A HUGE WING HERE FOR WHOEVER'S MANUFACTURING THESE UMSLPE ONE ANALOGUES IN THE AM BUT THE LUSHIANS WHO'S PAYING THE TAB WHILE WE ARE A NOW THE QUESTIONS WHY CAN'T THE GOVERNMENT SEE THAT THE ANSWERS BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENTS ON THE DULL TOO BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT A A THROUGH TARIFS ON YOU S MADE FOODS  GROSSES A FIFTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR SO THEY'RE PLAYER THEY'RE NOT JUST A REGULATOR THEY'RE AN ACTOR TO PLAY DEVER DEVIL'S ADVOCATE A LITTLE BIT LET'S OMA BE LAST PERSON AN STEP IN AN TR ND TO FEND GOVERNMENT AS AS A UNIFIED BODY ARE NOT QUALIFIED TO DO THAT BUT YOU COULD SEE HOW IT IF YOU LOOK AT IT LIKE CHECKERS INSTEAD OF CHESS YOU'D SAY O CAKE HERE'S A DRUG THAT'S GOING TO ALLOW MANY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO REDUCE THEIRE OVER ALL BODY WEIGHT OVER ALL BODY WEIGHT IS A RISK FACTOR FOR A NUMBER OF THINGS UM AND THERE WILL BE SAVINGS ON THE BACK AND AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THAT WEIGHT LOSS AND SO THAT'S THE CHECKERS VERSION THE CHESS VERSION IS HOW YOU'RE DESCRIBING IT AND I THINK THAT UM I MEAN CLEARLY PEOPLE IN GOVERNMENT ARE ARE WHILE MOST SOM PERHAPS ARE SMART ENOUGH TO PLAY CHEST NOT CHECKERS OR TILL HE'S UNDERSTAND IT BUT THERE'S VERY LITTLE INCENTIVE FOR THE CHESTS MODEL SO UM WHAT WOULD COTI QAT SOLVE THIS PR ROBLEM IS THE SAME THING THAT HAPPEN O FEN FEN WERE THIS ROM ROMANTUM ON IVANTS WRM IT WHICH IS IF SUDDENLY THERE'S A MAJOR ISSUE WITH THE DROGU THEN EVERYONE STOPS TAKING IT AND TRADITIONALLY THAT'S HOW IT'S GONE IT SOUNDS LIKETHE'S CHEEPY ONE ANALOGUES ER GAN TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE SHOOT THOUGH YE I MEAN THERE IS A VERY CLEAR DOWNSIDE TO THESE MEDICINES ON THE OTHER HAND YOU KNOW THERE'S AN UPSIDE AND SO I'M NOT SAD THAT THESE MEDICINES EXIST I'M FOR THEM I'M NOT AGAINST THEM I'M FOR THEM FOR THE RIGHT  AND RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT THE RIGHT PATION WHO'S GETTING JUST LIKE THE STADNS SO WHAT IF SOMEBODY WHO'S TAKING A ONE OF THESE ANALOGUES MAKES IT APPOINT TO DO RESISTANCE TRAINING AND HERE YOU KNOW YOU MENTION BODY BILDERS JUARLY I'M NOT I'M NOT SUGGESTING THEY BECOME BODY BILLERS BUT WE NOW KNOW WAN I THINK PETEROR TY ANOTHERS WOULD AGREE THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD BE DOING SOME FORM OF MUSCLE LOSS OFFSETTING RESISTANCE EXERCISE A GREAT AT LEAST PAST YOU KNOW THERE REACHING A THERE DULL HEIGHT OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW I I KNOW THERE RE THOSE THAT SAY WAIGHT TURNING DOESN'T BLUND YOUR HEIGHT BUT ANYWAY TTHETS TO SAY THAT FROM IT JRING EARLY TWENTY'S ONWARD DOES HE THAT TIN ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE ON THESE MEDICINES RIGHT IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN MUSCLE MASIS THAT'S A DIFFERENT PICTURE RIGHT OM PEOPLE ARE DRINKING LESS ALCOHAL AGEN ON PLAIN DEVIL'S ADVOCATE HERE OM SO IF WE LOOK AT THESE THESE COMPOUNDS NOT IN A VACUUM BUT O GAY THE PERSON'S BEEN CARRYING THAT EXTRA THIRTY POUNDS IS NOW ONLY CARRYING A FEW EXSTRA POUNDS OF ATIPOST ISSUE THEY'VE LOST A LOT OF MUSCLE BUT NOW THEY FEEL WELL ENOUGH TO EXERCISE AND OM THE DEPRESSION PART IT WORRIES ME BUT ANYWAY I'M JUST I'M JUST TRYING A ROUND THE CONTOUR OF IT WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN CHILDREN CAUSE THAT'S WHO I TOOK CARE WAS THAT OFTEN THEY NEEDED A JUMP START AND THERE WERE DIFFERENT WAYS TO GET HIM TO JUMP START STOMACH STAPLING WELL THAT'S NOT JUMP START THAT'S THAT WAS WHAT A LAING DOWN LAND I  I HAVE A FRIEND HES HE WHAT WAS AND SADLY STILL IS REALLY BEG AND HE ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT THE STOMACHS APING LIKE IF I COULD JUST GET FIFTY POUNDS DOWN QUICKLY THEN I COULD EXERCISE BUT EXERCISE IS PAINFUL THIS KIND OF THING AND AND SADLY HE'S HE'S CONTINUED TO MAINTAIN OR CREEP UP IN IN VERY EXCESSIVE WAY AND THAT'S THE POINT IS YOU KNOW THAT THIS CONCEPT OF JUMP START ACTUALLY IF YOU'RE ONLY DOING IT YOURSELF DOESN'T REALLY WORK AND THE QUESTION IS WHY IS HIS WAIGHT CREEPING UP IF HE'S HAD THE STOMACH STAPLING THE INSWUR IS CAUSE HE'S A SUGARATTIC YE HE'S DATFULLY ADDICTED TO THE SUPERBIG GULP SODA AND YUIF YOU DRINK YOUR CALORIES IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER DOES IT NOW AND AND HE'S GOT SUCH TERRIBLE SURIASIS AND JOINT PAIN AND NALL IS THAT THE PROSPECT OF EXERCISING IS LIKE A OU MIGHTS WELL TOMED IT TO LIKE FLAP HIS WINGS AND GO TO MARS THE AFROTOS IS A DRIVER OF IMMUNE ISFUNCTION IF HE GOT OFF YOU CAN TELL HIM FROM ME IF HE GOT OFF THE SUGAR HIS SURIASIS WOULD GET BETTER HIS WAIGHT WOULD GET BETTER HIS ARTHRIGTIS WOULD GET BETTER AND HE COULD HAVE THEN THAT JUMS START THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE TO BRIDGE TO THE BRAIN COMPONENT OF ALL THIS BECAUSE I'VE LONG WONDERED BASED ON WHAT INERSTAND ABOUT NARROW CIRCUITRY N NAUROW PLASTICITY I KNOW WE SHARE IN THIS KNOWLEDGE THAT AT SOME POINT CARRYING A LOT OF ATIPOST TISSUE MEANS THAT THE BRAINS WERE REPRESENTS THE BODY DIFFERENTLY AND WE WE KNOW THERE THESE THESE SEMATOTOPIC MAT MAPS OF SELF A YOU KNOW BUT THAT THE NARROW MACHINERY IN THE HYPOTHALMA SURE WHICH REESPONSIBLE FOR MOTIVATED STATES ET CETERA BUT BUT ALSO JUST THE ENTIRE MAPPING OF THE SELF CHANGE IS IN OTHER WORDS IF ONE IS FAT LONG ENOUGH THAT IT BECOMES INCREASINGLY HARD TO GET TO A A HEALTHY WAIGHT BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THE NARROW CIRCUITRY IS INPACT IT IT BASELY REEMAPS TO MAINTAIN THAT THAT ON FAT PERSON NOTNETILY EVEN JUST AT THE LEVEL OF APPETITE BUT JUST IN TERMS OF WHATY WHAT A BIG ANIMALS DO I HAD A BULDOG THE WAY NINY POUND BULLDONG MASTIVE HE WAS VERY ECONOMICAL WITH HIS MOVEMENT I GES EXTREMELY POWER TEL HE COULD RUN AT LEASTIN WHEN HE WAS YOUNGER BUT IF HE COULD BE STILL HE WAS STILL AS SUPPOSED OS A CERTAIN SMALLER ANIMALS THAT ARE LIKE PARYPOTATIC RIGHT BECAUSE BECAUSE HE WAS LEAPT IN RESISTANCE SO LEPTON AS WE TALKED ABOUT BRIEFLY IS A THE HORMON THAT TELLS YOUR BRAIN YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH IF YOU ARE LEAPT INSENSITIVE YOU ARE HAPPY TO BURN IF YOU ARE LEAPT IN RESISTANT YOUR BRAIN THINKS YOU'RE STRVING IF YOUR BRAIN THINKS YOU'RESTARVING IS GOING TO EFFECT YOU ARE BEHAVIOR IN TWO WAYS S CAN MAKE YOU ONE O EAT AND SO SO CAN TO MAKE YOU WANT A CON SERVE BECAUSE THE GOAL IS TOO TRY TO INCREASE THE LEAPT IN LEVELS IN ORDER TO OVERCOME THAT RESISTANCE WHICH OF COURSE YOU CAN NEVER DO BECAUSE ALLYN TOAS LAID DOWN MORE FAT AND MAKE MORE LEVTON AND MAKES SO ORE SAYS BECAUSE LEPTON COMES FROM THE ATIPOST EXACTLY SO THAT LEAPT IN RESISTANCE IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO BREAK THROUGH YOU HAVE TO FIX THE LEAPTIN SENSITIVITY WELL WHAT'S THE DRIVER OF THE LEAPT IN RESISTANCE INSOLENT INSOLENT INHIBITS LEPT IN SIGNALING IT DOES IT AT THREE SEPARATE PLACES IN THE PUMPSENER ON THE PROOPIUMLANACORTON NURON IN THE HYPOTHALEMUS IT DOES IT AT A IRUS TO INSLEN RECEPT O SUBSTRAIGHT TO IT DOES AT IT SUCK THREE SUPPRESSIV SIDE A KIND SIGNALING THREE AND IT DOES IT AT PIP THREE PHOSOTITLE IN US TO A TO TRYFOSFATE THOSE THREE SEPARATE ARMS OF THE A A LEAPT IN RECEPTOR ARE ALL THAYSICALLY PUT TO SLEEP BY HIGH INSOLENT INSOLEN BLOCKS LEAPT IN SIGNALING SO THE HIGHER THE INSLEN GOES THE MORE YOUR BRAIN THINKS YOU'RE STARVING AND THE MORE YOUR BRAIN THINKS YOUR STARVING THE HUNGER Y YOU GET AND THE LESS YOU WANT O MOVE SO THE GLETTONY IN SLOTH THAT WE'VE BEEN TAUG KING ABOUT ALL ALL IN A PODCAST IS REALLY BILE CHEMICAL IT IS SECONDARY TO THIS PHENOMENON OF INSOLEN BLOCKING LEPT IN SIGNALING YOU GOT A FIX THAT FIRST GET THE INSOLEN DOWN ANY WAY YOU CAN AND THE BEST WAY GET RID OF THE REFINED CARBL HAD WRITTEN SURE THAT'S WHRE YOU START IT MAKES SO MUCH SENSE IT WORKS TOO HOW ABOUT THAT THAT'S ALWAYS IT IS I ONCE HEARD YOU SAY I THINK IT WAS IN A CONVERSATION WITH PETER TEA ON HIS PODCASTS AND THIS REALLY STUCK IN MY MIND THAT WHEN A PERSON CONSUMES GLUCOS THAT IT ACTIVATES A NUMBER OF DIFFEREN BRAIN SIDES YOU DON'T BENARON'S LOVING GLUCOS BUT THAT WHEN ONE IN JESTFROCTOS THAT IT PREFERENTIALLY ACTIVATES NERONS IN THE REWARD PATHWAY A ER AT MAY BE SEVEN TIMES THE THE MAGNITUDE OR R SOMETHING LIKE THAT GLUCOS ACTIVATES THE BASIL GANGLEY A THIS IS WORK FROM WULNERHOUSE AND AND A SWITZERLAND AND ALSO ERCSTEI AT ARIZON O SINES MOVESMENT PLANNING AN EXECUTION EXACTLY A FROCTOST BASICALLY STIMULATES THE NUCLIS ACCUMBENCE THE REWARD CENTR IT IS JUST LIKE HEROINE JUST LIKE COKANE JUST LIKE A NICATINE IT ACTIVATES THE REWARD CENTRE IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING FOR THE BASIL GANGLEA SO IT IS A DICTIVE ANYTHING THAT STIMULATES THE REWARD CENTR IN THE EXTREME IS A DICTIVE SO WE'VE CHEMICAL EDDICTIONS HEROIN COQAN THE CATINOCAL SUGAR WE HAVE BEHAVIOUR ADDICTIONS SHOPING GAMBLING IN AN A GAMING SOCIAL MEDIA PORNOGRAPHY THE MATTER THEY ALL STIMULATE DON'T BEMIN IN THE REWARD CENTR AND IN THE EXTREME THEY ARE ALL ADDICTIVE SO THE QUESTION IS IF YOU WERE ADDICTED IS THAT PERSONAL RESPONSCIBILITY WELL IT'S A A VERY OM IT'S A QUESTION I THINK ABOUT A LOT BECAUSE I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE ADDICTION RECOVERY COMMUNITY IM BOTH FROM THE TREATMENT AND IN THE ATICTAN AND THIS ALWAYS COMES DOWN TO THIS QUESTION WHEN SOMEBODY IS SUFFERING FROM AN ADDICTION OF ANY KIND AND THEIR RESISTANT TO GETTING TREATMENT IF YOU LOOK AT IT THEM AS A AS BEING SICK AT LEAST IN THAT MOMENT IS A SICK PERSON IN THE BASTER WORST OR AT LEAST DIMINISHED POSITION TO GUIDE THEIR OWN TREATMENT SOFERANCE IS SOMEBODY WITH DI MENSION WHEN YOU ASKE THEM DO YOU WANTO GO SEE ANEROLOGIST YOU MIGHT ASK THEM THAT BUT ARE THEY THE BEST PERSON TO MAKE THAT DECISION OT THIS IS THE PROBLEM SO THAT THIS IS THIS IS WHERE PERSON RESPONSIBILITY FALLSDOWN SO PERSON RESPONSIBILITY AS CAN WE TALKED ABOUT FOUR CRITERI HAVE TO BE MET NONE OF THEM RE MET THAT'S THE FIRST ISSUE SECOND ONE IS A LITTLE BIT SHALL WE SAY CHEEKGEAR WHO INVENTED PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND E I DEA I'M DEFFLING AGETES THIS ONE ARE ALL YE YOU GIVE YOUF THE I READY I DON'T KNOW THA TOBACCO INDUSTRY THE NOTION OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITEY INVENTED IT THERE WAS NO PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY UNTIL TOBACCO IN NINETEEN SIXTY TWO CAUSE THEY WERE GETTING KILLED ON THE SCIENCE AND THEY NEEDED TO INVENT ANOTHER REASON FOR YOU TO SMOKE IN FACT THERE'S A PAPER THAT CAME OUT DORSEMEN AT ALL THAT LOOKED AT THE NEW YORK TIMES IN THE WASHINGTON POST AND THEY DID A ENTIRE LITS SEARCH OF THE ENTIRE OF A YOU KNOW THEALL THE OUTPUT OF THOSE TWO NEWSPAPERS FOR DECADES TO LOOK FOR THE TERM PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND THE VERY FIRST TIME IT WAS EVER MENTIONED WAS NINETEEN SIXTY TWO AND IT DIDN'T PICK UP IN SPEED UNTIL NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX WHICH WAS THE SAME YEAR AS SIPOLONI VE LIGOT IN THE  THE SUPREME COURT WHICH BASICALLY SAID THAT THE A YOU KNOW THAT A A THE CIGARETTE INDUSTRY WAS A WAS GUILTY OF A OF A APPLYING PEOPLE WITH THE ANEDICTIVE SUBSANCE SO THIS IS VERY SPECIFICALLY INDUSTRY DRIVEN AND WE HAVE THE DATA TO PROVE IT AMAZING W I WONDER ALONG LINES OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY ON GIVEN THAT MANY LISTENERS THIS CONVERSATION ARE GOING TO BE THINKING ABOUT THEIR OWN FOOD IN TAKE AND FOOD CHOICES THAT OF THEIR CHILDREN AND OTHER RELATIVES NOW WE COULD PLAY A LITTLE A LITTL  NOT A GAME BUT A LITTLE RAPID ISH FIRE CUE AND E NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE IN THIS PODGAS BUT I THINK IT'S PARTICULARLY APPROPRIATE FOR A DISCUSSION LIKE THIS THAT WEEKS OUT INTO SO MANY AREAS AND I ABSOLUTELY WILL INVITE YOU BACK AND A PERHAPS A LING LEASURE AM IMISS APPLE TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE EXCITING WORK YOU GOTS AR DOIG AUS ARE SO MUCH WE COULD COVER BUT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WONDER IN A VERY PRACTICAL SENSE WHETHER OR NOT THEY SHOUDER SHOULD NOT BE CONSUMING CERTAIN THINGS AND I KNOW YOU'RE NOT THE FOOD POLICE ABOUT THE EN I'M NOT A COP AND I DO BELIEVE PEOPLE SHOULD ARE SHOULD BE IN CHOICE ABOUT THESE MATTERS BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE YOU'R GEST ON THE POTCASTING YOURE AN ANARMED AND AND HAVE DONE CLINICAL WORK AND RESEARCH FOR SO MANY YEARS IN THIS AREA AND YOU HAVE SUCH A CLEAR STANDS ON THE ROLE OF BIG FOOD AND AND WE REALLY REALLY APPRECIATE E YOUR HONESTY IN DIRECTNESS HE TOT YOU BE WILLING TO PROVIDE COMMENT ABOUT US COUPLE OF DIFFERENT TERMS THAT ALL THROW OUT AND IF YOU CHOOSE TO SAY REALLY NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT THAT FINE THAT WOULD BE A QUICK PASS SO AM HERE WE GO A AND WE COVERED A LOWBIT OF THIS EARLIER BUT A FRUIT IN WHOLE FORM SO A HAS FROTOS BUT HAS FIBRE SO A THUMBS UP THUMB SIDEWAYS OR THUMBS DOWN FOR FRUIT CONSUMPTION FRUIT IS FUN FRUITUS S NOT GREAT THANK YOU WHITE RICE VERSES BROWN RICE AND AMONG THE WHITE RICE IS THE STICKY RICE AM AND THE RICEIS WITH ADDED SUGARS WHICH YOU FIND IN A LOT OF AM A LOT RESTAURANTS BROWN RICE BECAUSE OF THE FIBR WHITE RICE POLISHED YOU KNOW NUMER ONE ALL THE VITEM AND BE ONE GONE AND OF COURSE A MARCH LARGER GLUCOS EXCURSION THAT GLYCEMIC INDEX THING WHICH OF COURSE I HATE IS IT'S GLYCEMIC LOAD THAT MATTERS AND THAT IS A VERY HIGH GLYCEMIC LOD SO BROWNRICE SO BROWN RICE IS BETTER THAN WHITE RICE YES O  IN A MEANINGFUL WAY IN A MEANINGFUL WAY OK A EARLIER YOU MENTION TOMATO SAUCE I LOVE TOMTO SAUCE THAT'S MADE FROM JUST TOMATOES CAN TOMATE SO IS ARE MOST TOMATO SAUCEIS FILLED WITH SUGAR PERFECT OR LITTLE A RECOMMENDATION ENGINE LOOKED AT THIS CUESTION AND IT TURNS OUT THAT ONLY TEN PER CENT OF THE AVAILABLE TOMATO SAUCES OUT ON THE MARKET DON'T HAVE ADDED SUGAR SO YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHICH ONES WHEL YOU CAN LOOK YOURSELF OR YOU CAN LOOK UP PERFECT AND IT WILL TELL YOU WHICH ONES YOU CAN BUY IF PEOPLE CHOSE TO CONSUME BREAD WHICH MANY PEOPLE DO A IS THERE A WAY TO IS ACROSS THE BOARD WITHOUT JUST BAKING YOUR OWN OR SEET OR LOOKING AT THE INGREDIENTS LESS TO MAKE A BETTER CHOICE IS   SOUR DO'S TEND HAVE LESS SUGAR THEN BLANK AM WILL SOUR DOUGH HAS BEEN FERMENTED SO IT WILL ACTUALLY CONSUME SOME OF THE SUGAR SO IT WOULD BE A BETTER CHOICE BUT REALLY THE BEST CHOICE IS THE HIGHEST FIBRE BREADS NO IF YOU LOOK AT A WHEAT BERRY IT IS TWENTY FIVE PER CENT O FIBRE THE HUSK IS TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE WHEIGHT OF THAT WHEAT BERRY THAT MEANS THAT THE CARBRAL HYDRATE TO FIBRE RATIO OF A WHEAT BERRY IS THREE TO ONE SO A GOOD BREAD SHOULD HAVE A CARBAL HYDRATE TO FIBRE RATIO OF SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THREE TO ONE THE FIVE TO ONE TOPS ANYTHING ABOVE THAT MEANS THAT THEY'VE STRIPPED THE FIBRE AWAY S THAT SOMETHING YOU COULD DO BUT THE EASIER WAY IS TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT UP ON PERFECT YOU MENTION MEAT AND MEAT SOURCING AM EGG AND CHICKEN SOURCING EARLIER MAY WE JUST REVISIT THAT AM MEAT FISHING EGGS A THUMS UP THUM SIDEWAYS THUMS DOWN OR IT DEPENDS IT DEPENDS DEPENDS ON WHERE THE MEAT CAME FROM IT DEPENDS ON WHETHER IT WAS PASTURE RAISE DEPENDS ON WHETHER IT'S ORGANIC OR NOT IF THEY A ANIMAL WAS INJECTED WITH ANOBIATICS STAY AWAY FROM IT BECAUSE THOSE ANABATICS ARE IN THE MEAT THEIR GON UP BASICALLY STERILIZE YOUR GOT AND THEN THE BAD BACTERIA ARE GOING TO TAKE OVER WE HAVEN'T REALLY TALK MUCH ABOUT THE MICROBIUM TO DAY BUT THAT'S A WHOLE POTCASTLE BY ITSELF WE CAN TOUCH ON A A LITTLE BIT MORE A FROM LOW SUGAR FERMENTED FOODS THUMS UP THOM SIDEWAYS THOMFERMEN IT FOOD SHORT CHAIN FATIASSEDS ALL GOOD WHAT ARE YOUR FAVOURITE SOURCES OF FERMENTED AND I LIKE HIMCHI I LIKE HIM CHITELIKE SOME OF THE LIVE SOUR CROWDS YET THAT'S ALSO GOOD BUT WITH THE RIGHT YOU KNOW THE RIGHT TO ACCU ACCOUTREMENT A THE ONE THING I WOULD BE A A CAREFUL ABOUT IS YEOGART  SO THERE ARE YEOGARTS WITH LIFE CULTURES AND THEIR A WHOLE LOTY OGERETS WITH DEAD CULTURES AND IF IT'S A YEOGAR WITH DEAD CULTURES ITS KIND OF IRRELEVANT AND THE CHANCES ARE THEY'VE ACTUALLY COVERED UP THE SOURNESS WITH SUGAR SO COMMERIU O LARGE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE YOGER BE VERY VERY CAREFUL E IF IT'S A YOU KNOW ARTISON YEOGART YOU KNOW MADE BY A YOU KNOW PEOPLE YOU KNOW OR TRUST YOU KNOW THAT'S A VERY DIFFERENT STORY A YOU KNOW YOGRS WITH LIFE CULTURES INTERMIN FASTIN DO YOU PRACTISE AT IN WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT IT A I DON'T PRACTISE IT BUT I AM FOR IT FOR THE RIGHT PATIENT TURNS OUT WHO'SE THE RIGHT PATIENT THE PATIENT WITH LIVER FAT BECAUSE THE RECEN AT WORKS IS CAUSE IT GIVES DELIVERA CHANCE TO BASICALLY BURN OFF THE FAT THAT ITS STORED ZERO CALORY SODA GOT IT  DEFINITE KNOW AND I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO ASK ABOUT SUGARY SODA BECAUSE TAT A THAT THATS PASICALLY JUST POISON AND AGAIN FOOD COMMINATIONS A IVE A FEELG I KNOW YOUR ANSWER IS BUT THE GLICIMIC IN DEX WHICH WE KNOW YOUR FEELINGS ON NOW A ASSERTS THAT IF YOU COMBINE SOME FAT WITH A SUGARY LIKE LIKE EATING ICE CREAM YOU HAVE A MORE BLUNTED INSOLENT RESPONSE THAN IF YOU WERE TOET PURE SUGAR OF EQUIVALENT CALORIES BUT AM BUT WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON FOOD COMBINATIONS AS A WAY TO BLUNT THE INSOLENT RESPONSE FOOD COMBINATIONS ARE GREAT IF THERE SOME FIBR ASSOCIATED WITH IT COMES BACK TO FIBR AGAIN AND BY THE WAY AND BY THE WAY I OU KNO FULL DISCLOSURE I AM THE CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER OF A FIBR COMPANY WHAT IS IT IT IS CALLED BIOLUMAN AND IT IS A PROPRIETARY FIBR IT IS A A MICRO SETTLE OF SPONGE SEVEN MI CRONS IN DIAMETER TO THE SIZE OF RED BLOOD SELL YOU SWALLOW IT IT GHOST YOUR STOMACH IT EXPANDS SEVENTY FOLD OVER ITS ORIGINAL SIZE A SO TO GIVE YOU A FEELING OF FULLNESS AS ITS TAKING UP SPACE AND STOMACH BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WHEN IT EXPANDS THE NOOKS IN THE CRANNIES IN THE SPONGE BECOME AVAILABLE AND IMBEDDED IN THOSE NOOKS AND CRANNIES ARE A SET OF PROPRIETARY HYDROGELLS SOLUBLE FIBR WHICH SEQUESTER LUCOS FROTO SUCRO SIMPLE STORCHES AND RENDER THEM UNAVAILABLE FOR EARLY ABSORPTION IN THE DUADIN THEM THUS REDUCING THE GLUCOS RESPONSE REDUCING THE INSOLENT RESPONSE PROTECTING THE LIVER AND MOVING IT THROUGH THE INTESTAN SO THAT MICROBIUM CAN SHEWIT UP FOR ITS OWN PURPOSES FEEDING THE GUT WE CAN REDUCE GLUCOS ABSORPTION BY THIRTY SIX PER CENT FRUCTOS ABSORPTION BY THIRTY EIGHT PER CENT SUCOS ABSORPTION BY FORTY PER CENT SIMPLE STARCH ABSORPTION BY NINE PER CENT AND INCREASE SHORT CHAINED FATIAS IT PRODUCTION BY SIXTY PER CENT WITHOUT AN INCREASE IN GUESS WHEN DO PEOPLE TAKE THIS WITH THE MEALS OSO IIT COMES AS A SACHET A ONTEASPOON SPRINKLE IT ON YOUR FOOD OR TAKE IT AS A YOU KNOW IN A DRINTK YOU KNOW JUST MIX  IT IN AND SLUG IT DOWN AND THEN EAT BREAKFAST LUNCH OR DINNER AND IT WILL BASICALLY ACT LIKE YOU ATE REAL FOOD IT WILL TURN PROCESS FOOD INTO REAL FOOD IN THE INTESTON AND WE HAVE CLINCAL TRIAL DATE OF THE DEMONSTRATES THAT IS IT AVAILABLES O COMMERCIANIT IS AVAILABLE IT IS CALLED MUNCH MUNCH NOW I HATE THAT NAME I HAADEN'T MAKE IT UP WELL A WA IS YOU NARGATE MARGE THAT YOU MARKETTING TOUM STOCKS BU THE PRODUCTS OUNS AMAZING AM  VILIMIN DOTEC GREAT THANK YOU FOR THAT SORRY MUNCH MUNCH MARGENING HE MA I YO GOT OF MUNCH MUNCH TO A NEW PRODUC IAA BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE  AA VERY INTERESTING PRODUC AND IT ACTUALLY ANSWER MY NEXT QUESTION WHICH WAS ABOUT AM FIBRE SUPPLEMENTS FIBRE IS GOOD BUT THEREARE TWO KINDS OF FIBRE THER SOLUBLE AND THERE'S INSOLUBEL THEY ARE NOT THE SAME SO SOLUBLE IS WHAT GOES INTO FIBRE ONE BARS YOU KNOW THAT SILLYUM A INULIN A A AA PECTAN LIKE WHAT HOLDS JELLY TOGETHER A THAT'S GOOD NOT SAYING IT'S BAD BUT YOU NEED THE INSOLUBLE FIBRE THE SELULESS THE STRINGY STUFF IN SELERY THE CARDBOARD IF YOU WILL A TOGETHER THEY FORM THIS JELL THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER IF YOU ONLY CONSUME THE SOLUBLE FIBRE WHICH IS WHAT THE FOOD IN THE STREE WILL ADD TO TO FOOD CAUSE THEINSOLUBLE FIBREIS NOT MISSIBLE IF YOU ONLY HA THE SOLUBLE FIBRE BACK YOU'RE NOT GETTING THE BENEFITS OF THE ENTIRE FIBRE COMPLIMENT EARLY ER WHEN TALKING ABOUT THE NOVA SYSTEM AND HOW MOST ALL OF OUR FOODS ARE NINE BUT SAY I KNOW I SEVEN TETEMBER SENT LETCSING NINETY FIVE PER CENT BUT THEY ARE ON THE SIDE OF BETTER A NINETY FIVE PER CENT OUR FOOD SHOULD COME FROM NOVA SYSTEM CLASS WANTER CLASS TO FOODS OR THREE OR THREE O CAN STAING AWAY FROM THOSE AM NOVA CLASS OFOR FOODS AND YOU GIVE US SOME EXAMPLES OF NOVA CLASS WANTING CLASS TO FOODS AM IT JUST BROUGHT BROADLY SPEAKING ONOVA CLASS ONE IS ANY FOOD WITHOUT A LABEL PERIOD IF YOU SEE A LABEL ON A FOOD IT'S A WARNING LABEL BUT THERE'S GROUND GROUND BEEF HAS A LABEL OCASTS O THAT'S WELL DOES IT  SAME TIME OUT APPLL WHEN I BIDE IT IT HAS A LABEL I'M ASKNGS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE IN A WONDER SO WET DOES HAVE A NUTRITIAN FACTS LABEL IS THERE NUTRICIAN FACTS LABEL ON A THING OF GRANBY I BUY THAT'S THAT A GROUNBEE FOR A CONSUME VENISON IM WER IF YOU FLIP IT OVER IT SAYS HOW MANY CALLERIES O NY APPROACHING IT SO THERE'S A LABEL IM BY AREN'T BUT IT'S JUST BE FOR VENISON O  O NOT DONE THAT'S CLASS WANT A EGG TEGG IS CLASS ONE SO AND I'M COURSE FRUIT APPLES ORIMS O GES IT DOESN'T MATTER IF HAS IT HAS A NAME A NAME TAG AS LONG AS IT IT DOESN'T HAPAN UNREFITIONS LAST LABEL GOT IT F REAL FOOD DOES NOT NEED A LABEL IT'S ONLY IF THEY DID SOMETHING TO IT THAT IT NEEDS A LABEL SO YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT EVERY LABEL IS A WARNING LABEL NOW THE PROBLEM WITH THE LABEL IS IT ONLY TELLS YOU WHAT'S IN THE FOOD WHITH YOU REALLY NEED TO KNOW IS WHAT'S BEEN DONE TO THE FOOD BECAUSE IT'S THE ULTRA PROCESS FOOD THAT'S THE PROBLEM THEY DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU THAT THAT'S SECRET SECRET FROM A PROPRIETARY STANDPOINT BUT ALSO SECRET BECAUSE IF YOU KNEW WHAT THEY DID TO IT YOU WOULDN'T NEED IT YOUOULD NEVER BUY IT THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW SO THEY ONLY TELL YOU WHAT'S IN THE FOOD THAT'S NOT WHAT'S IMPORTANT IT'S WHAT'S BEEN DONE TO THE FOOD THATS IMPORTANT AND THAT'S WHY THIS NOBLE CLASS FOR SO IMPORTANT AND THAT'S WHY PERFECT ITS SO IMPORTANT CAUSE IT'LL DO THE WORK FOR YOU I WELL DEFONLY A'M VADDLING STOLE OF THESE SO IF YOU COULD PICK ONE THING TO RECOMMEND TO PEOPLE THAT WANT TO IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH GET REDY SUGAR VERY VERY CLEAR HAT'S NUMBER ONE NUMBER TOO GO FOR A WALK ACT THE EXERCISE PIECE GO FOR WL AND IF YOU COULD RECOMMEND ONE THING THAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC CAN DO TO TRY IN IM ASSIST IN THIS ADVOCACY FOR NOT REDEFINING BUT ACTUALLY CLEARLY DEFINING WHAT IS FOOD IND WHAT ISN'T AND MAKING PEOPLE AWARE IM AT THE LEVEL OF POLICY AND CHINES AND SCHOOL LUNCH IS AM IF THEYE WERE WANT THEM WHAT CAN WE DO I MEAN I IYOU CLEARLY ACTIVATED MINER ON SURROUNDING LIKE THAT THAT THE SET OF PROBLEMS THAT EXIST AND IT THAT THE PATS TO CORRECT THEM BUT SHOULD WE BE WRITING TO OUR CONGRESS PEOPLE SHOULD WE BE I GETTING ANGRY AT HOSPITALS BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT ALL THESE FAST FOOD MACHINES AND THAT THE CAFITERI OF FOOD IS LIKEWADE IS IT LIKE IS LIKE ILLNESS PROMOTING A NO E AS AFF WE'VE GOT RID OFLL SUGAR BEVERAGES WE HAVE THE HEALTHY BEVERAGE INITIATIVE SO NON'T CO CAN MACHINES YOU KNOW S COK MACHINES TAIT YOU SEE US OH STANFORD CHECK THAT OUT CAUSE IT OU NOW PEOPLE ALWAYS SEND ME PICTURES OF THE OF THE COKE MACHINES AND THE SCHOOL MEDICINE IM  LIKE LIST AND I DIDN'T PUT HEM THERE BUT I I I IE HAVE TE MODEL FOR THE PUBLIC YOU KNOW I MEAN WHERE WHERE WAS THE FIRST PLACE THE SMOKING WAS BANND HOSPITALS  BECAUSE WE KNEW SO IF YOU GET RID OF THE TOU DON'T A I SODA IF YOU GET ER TO THE SUGAR SODA AT THE HOSPITAL YOU'RE TELLING PEOPLE SOMETHING SO YET I THINK THAT EVERY HOSPITAL AND WREALLY EVERY PUBLIC VENU IN AMERICA NEED'S TO CLEAR OUT THE JUNK SO POSTPHOTOS OF JUNK THAT ARE SUPPOSE TO BE IN AIN HEALTH PROMOTING INSTITUTIONS AND AN I GUESS WE TRON A CANCEL JAE MATRANASH O I'M PETTY OPPOS TO CANCEE CULTER BUT HERE WE GO AN IT CANSAM MARVELLOUS IT'S ACTIONABLE AT STRAIGHTFORWARD IT'S LOW COSTLOW TIME AN VESTMEN A ZEROCOSLET A VERY LOW TIME INVESTMENT THANK YOU FOR THAT AND LOOK UP EAT REAL BECAUSE WE'RE DOING IT FOR YOUR KIDS SO YOU NEED TO HELP SUPPORT IT ANY SCHOOL DISTRICT IN AMERICA CAN DO IT SO WHAT ARE WE DO WE HAVE A BUSINESS MODEL WHEREBY THE A FOOD SERVICES DIRECTOR A EITHER PURCHASES OR RENTS A DILAPIDATED FACTORY IN THE CENTR OF THE DISTRICT WE PURPOSES IT INTO A FOOD PREPARATION FACILITY THEY CAN MAKE TWENTY SEVEN TO THIRTY THOUSAND MEALS A DAY CAY WITH A YOU KNW SKELETON CREW AND THEN THEY AND AND YOU CONTROL WHAT'S IN IT AND BECAUSE YOU'RE BUYING IN VOLUME IT ACTUALLY REDUCES THE COST SO IT'S CHEAPER THAN BUYING IT FROM CISCO OR AREMARK OR SEDECSOVER WHEREVER AND THEN YOU FARM IT OUT THEYOU KNO TRUCER BUS TO ALL THE DIFFERENT SCHOOLS SO EVERY KID GETS A HOT MEAL MADE FROM SCRATCH EACH DAY AND WE CAN SOLVE THIS PROBLE CAN'T HELP UT ASK THIS ONE LAST QUESTION FOR PEOPLE THEY WANT TO CUT OUT SUGAR WHICH OU CLEARLY STATED IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO DO FOR ONE'S HEALTH HOW DO WE KNOW HOW MUCH SUGAR IS IN SOMETHING I SO SHOULD PEOPLE BE LOOKING AT LABELS AND JUST LOOKING FOR HOW MUCH SUGAR HOW MUCH CARBA HYDRATE OR COULD WE EVEN GO SO FAR AS TO SAY IF IT SAYS AM HYFHROTOS CORN SYRUP THAN IT'S IT'S ON THE NOFLILIST DON'T DON'T DON'T EAN IT SO THE PROBLEM THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY TWO NAMES FOR SUGAR AND THE FOODINTRE USES ALL OF EM THE REASON THEY USE ALL OF EM IS BECAUSE THEY CAN INCLUDE A DIFFERENT SUGAR AS NUMBER FIVE NUMBER SIX NUMBER SEVEN NUMBER EIGHT NUMBER NINE ON THE LIST WHEN YOU ADD IT UP IT BECOMES NUMER ONE THEY HIDE IT IN PLAIN SIGHT AND THEY DO IT ON PURPOSE NOW DO I EXPECT EVERYBODY TO REMEMORIZE OLL TWO HUNDRED SIXTY TWO NAMES NO OF COURSE NOT CAN YOU FIGURE IT OUT YOURSELF WELL THE INSERS KNOW UNLESS THEY HAVE THE LINE WHERE IT SAYS ADDED SUGARS IF IT SAYS ADDED SUGARS IT IS EITHER SUCROS OR HIGFRUCTOS CORNSER NORA'S ADDING LACTOS KE THAT'S NOT OUR GLUCOS THEYN NOT EVEN ADD IN GLUCOS BECAUSE LUCOS ISN'T THAT SWEET LUCOS IS NOT THAT INTERESTING YOU DON'T SEE PEOPLE GOING AROUND SHUGGING CARO SYRUP DO YOU CA THAT'S GLUCOS WHO CARES YET MIGHT BE GOOD IN THE MOLASSAS COOKY BUT THAT'S IT I SO IT'S FRUCTOS SO YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S BEEN ADDED SO IF IT SAYS ADDED SUGARS THAT'S A GOOD PLACE TO START NO GREATER THAN ONE TEASPOON PER SERVING NO GREATER THAN FOUR GRAHAMS PERSERVING OF ADDED SUGARS ANYTHING GREATER THAN THAT LEAVE AT THE STOR AN AIM FOR THOS NOW OF A TYPE TIME NAV FOR NO AM FOR NOVERTYPES ON TWO AND THREE AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S NO VATYPE WEN TWO OR THREE YOU CAN USE PERFECT AND IF YOU DON'T LOOK AT THAT THEN GO LOOK AT THE NUTRITIAN FACTS LABLE AND ANYTHING THAT HAS MORE THAN FOUR INGREDIENTS IS NOBLE CLASS FOR ROBERT LUSDIG THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU'VE PROVIDED SUCH AN INCREDIBLE EDUCATION IN NUTRITIONAL BI CHEMISTRY THE PROCESSING OF FAT PROTINE CABEHYDRATE SUGAR FROCTOS IN

DOCTOR VIVAC MIRTHY DOCTOR VIVIC MERTHY WELCOME THINK SO MUCH ANDREW AND PLEASE CALL ME VIVA COM INFORMAL O HE VEC MY UNDERSTANDING BASED ON MY INTERNATE SEARCH IS THAT THE ROLE OF THE U  SURGEON GENERAL IS TO PROVIDE SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION ON HOW TO IMPROVE HEALTH AND REDUCE RISK OF ILLNESS AND INJURY DON'T HAVE THAT CORRECT THAT IS CORRECT WHAT ARE SOME OTHER ROLLES THAT YOU PLAY THAT PERHAPS WOULD NOT COME UP IN A A TOP A TOP HIT UGAL CHURCH THA THAT I OUGHT TO BE AWARE OF AND THAT OUR AUDIENCE OUGHT TO BE AWARE OF HERE IS HOW I I GENERALY EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE THERE THEYRE TWO PRIMARY ROLLS THE SURGEON GENERAL HAS ONE IS TO ENGAGE WITH THE PUBLIC CAN MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT CRITICAL PUBLICHELTH ISSUES THAT THINKS THEY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE HOW TO PROTECT THEMSELVES IN THEIR FAMILIES THIS SECOND ROLE OF THE SURGEONT GENERAL IS LESS ER KNOWN BUT IT'S EQUALLY IS IMPORTANT WHICH IS TO OVERSEE ONE OF THE EIGHT UNIFORM SERVICES IN THE US GOVERNMENT AND THAT IS THE UNITED STATES PUBLIC HELT SERVICE MANY PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE ARMY THE NAVY THE ER FORCE DO BE ALSO HAVE THE U S PUBLIC HELT SERVICE WHICH IS SIX THOUSAND OFFICERS INCLUDE DOCTORS NURSES PHYSICAL THEROPE IS FARM ASSISTS PUBLICAT ENGINEERIS WHOLE RANGE OF OF HELTHCAREFOLKS AND BEER JOB IS TO PROTECT OUR NATION FROM PUBLIC HELTTHREATS SO WHEN IBOLA I CAME ON THE SCENE AN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN IIN A MAJUR AWAY IN WEST AFRICA WE SENT HUNDREDS OF OFFICERS TOO WESTN AFRICA TO SET UP THE MON ROVIA MEDICAL UNIT IN LIBERIATO TREAT PEOPLE WOULD LIKE WITH A WITH IBOLA DOMESTICALLY WHEN THEIR HURRICANES OR TORNADOES WE DISPATCH OFFICERS AND DEPLOY THEM TO GO HELP STRENGTHEN THE SOCIAL THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND FOR STRUCTURE BUT ALSO TO PROVIDE DIRECT CARE WE DEPLOY THOUSANDS OF OFFICURES DURING COVID SO THESE OFFICERS I'M INCREDIBLY PROUD OF THEM I THEY COULD BE NO LOTS OF SUFF YOU OUTSIDE GOVERNMENT OF PRIVATE SECTOR PROBABLY MAKING A WHOLE LOT MORE MONEY GET NO YOU NO WORK NALL LESS HARD BUT THEY'RE REALLY COMMITTED TO PROTECTING THE PUBLIC HEALTH OF THE NATION SO I' HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF OVERSEEING THAT SERVICES SURGEON GENERAL AND THOSE THOSE THOSE OF THE JOBS  THAT I'VE SIGNED UP FOR IN THIS ROL GOT IT I WAS NOT AWARE OF THAT ROLE AND IF I UNDERSTOOD CORRECTLY THESE PEOPLE AND THESE PUBLIC HEALT OFFICERS A THAT PRESUMBLY ARE MADE UP OF PHYSICIANS AND LICEENT PSYCHOLOGISTS AND NURSES AND SO FORTH A TH YOU SAID THEY COULD BE MAKING A SUBSTANTIALLY HIRING COMES IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR BUT THE WORK THAT THEI'R DOING WITH YOU IS THEIR SOUL CAREER THIS POINT THEY'RE COMPLETELY DEVOTED TO THAT OR THEIR DOING THIS AS A SIDE HUSTLE NOW THAT THEY ARE FULL TIME IGOVERNMENT OF PLOSE AND AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC HEALT SERVICE THEIR DAY JOB IS OFTEN IN PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES WERE THEIR EMBEDDED IN COMMUNITIES HEALPING DAY TO DAY TO ADVANCE PUBLIC HEALTH AND DURING TIMES OF EMERGENCY HIE WE DEPLOY THEM I YOU KNOW AND AND THEYRE THER EXTRAORDINARILY WELL TRAINED A THEIR EXPERIENCED A DEALING WITH ADVERSITY BUT THEY BRING A COMBINATION OF SKILL AND HEART TO THEIR WORK AND YOU REALLY NEED BOTH TO BE EFFECTIVE AT PUBLIC HEALPH I'M GLAD THAT YOU MENTION THE WORD EMERGENCY BECAUSE IN PREPARING FOR OUR DISCUSSION TO DAY IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT IN THI A LIST OF ROLES THAT A YOUR TITLE ASSUMES THAT SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION ON HOW TO IMPROVE HEALTH COME FIRST THEN YOU MENTIONED EMERGENCY SO WHAT I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT FIRST IS HEALTH NON LACK OF HEALTH YE BUT HEALTH IT NOS SO OFTEN WE HEAR ABOUT O THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS BUT WHAWERE REALLY TALKING ABOUT IS THE LACK OF MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS ACH MENTAL ILLNESS AND RARELY DO WE HEAR FOR INSTANCE WHAT CONSTITUTES MENTAL HEALTH WE HEAR WHAT CONSTITUTES MENTAL ILLNESS WHEREAS IN THE DOMAIN OF PHYSICAL HEALTH THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION OUT THERE ABOUT HOW TO BE MORE PHYSICALLY HEALTHY CARTIVASCAL EXERCISE RESISTANCE EXERCISE YOO GO TYPE EXERCISE MOBILITY ET CETERA AND OF COURSE SOME PEOPLE HAVE PHYSICAL HEALTH AILMENTS AND THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION TERMS OF HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT AS WEALT BUT WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW BEFORE WE GET IN TO THE LONG LIST OF ISSUES THAT  OUR NATION CONFRONTS UM EVERYTHING FOR MOBISITY TO FOOD OUT IT IS TO MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WHAT IS GOING WEALL IN OTHER WORDS IN THE LAST LET' SAY FIVE TO TEN YEARS HAVE THERE BEEN ANY AREAS OF PHYSICAL HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH IMPROVEMENT IN THE YOU ASS AT LARGE THAT WE CAN ATTRIBUTE TO SOME OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH INITIATIVES A DIRECTLY S THAT'S REALY GOO QUESTION AND LET ME JUST ALSO SAY ABOUT THE VERY FIRST POINT YOU RAISE THAT YOU'RE ABSOLUTE RIGHT THAT WE HAVE OPERATED PRIMARELY THROUGH AN ILLNESS FRAME WHEN WE LOOK AT HEALTH AND IN MY MIND THAT'S ONLY ONE HALF OF THE EQUATION SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PHYSICAL ILLNESS FOR EXAMPLE YOUKNOW AS A DOCTOR I LEARNED HOW TO DIAGNOSE AND TREAT SOME WUL DIBETIES OR WITH HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE OR WITH CORDINARY HEART DISEASE BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT EVEN IF I DON'T HAVE DIABETIES OR CORINARY HEART DISEASE AHOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE YOUVEN I I DON'T HAVE ANY DIAGNOCIBLE MEDICAL CONDITION I MAY NOT BE AT AN OPNIBLE LEVEL OF PHYSICAL HEALTH RIGHT I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FOR EXAMPLE WALK ROUND THE BLOCK WITHOUT GETTING SHORT OF BREATH I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PLAY WITH MY KIDS CAS BY PHYSICAL PHINIS AND STAMINA IS IS NSUFFICIENT I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO LIFT MY LUGGAGE WHEN I GO TO THE AIRPORT A BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE AN A STRENGTH IN MY BODY YET I WOULDN'T HAVE A DIAGNOSIBLE MENTAL ILLNESS SO I THINK IT'S EASIER TO UNDERSTAND THERE WITH PHYSICAL HEALTH THAT WE'RE NOT JUST AIMING FOR LACK OF ILLNESS WE'RE AIMING TO OPTIMISE OUR PHYSICAL HEALTH THE SAME IS TRUE WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND I THINK WHEN WE TALK ABOUT MANAHAL PEOPLE THINK WE'RE JUST THE SOLE GOL HERE IS TO PREVENT DIAGNOSIBLE MENTAL ILLNESS THAT IS ONEGL TO BOTH PREVENT AND TO MANAGE A MENTAL LLNESS WHEN IT ARISES BUT WE ALSO NEED TO RECONIZE AS A WHOLE OTHER HALF OF THIS SPECTRE WHERE THER PEOPLE MAY NOT HAVE DIAGNOCIBLE MENTAL ILLNESS BUT ARE NOT OPERATING OPTIMALLY IN THEIR LIVES AND THAT'S DETRACTING FROM THEIR FULFILLMENT FROM THEIR FUNCTIONALITY LIKE IN NOT JUST AT WORK BUT ALSO IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND IN THEIR FAMILIES AND SO THING PART OF THE CONVERSATION THAT THAT I WANT US TO HAVE AS A COUNTRY IS ABOUT HOW TO OPTIMIZE MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL BEING AND THAT IS INCLUDES PREVENTING MENTAL ILLNESS BUT IT IS MUCH BROADER AND BIGGER I THAN THAT ALONE GREAT I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT AM TREATING DISEASES CRITICAL OBVIOUSLY BUT THAT THERE'S A LOT THAT CAN BE DONE TO IMPROVE ONE'S HEALTH EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY KNOWN DISEASE AND AND YOU'VE GOT ALL THESE OFFICERS THESE INCREDIBLE PHYSICIANS AND A NURSES AND A PEOPLE AT A YOUR DISPOSAL I MY HOPE IS THAT THEY WOULD ALSO BE ACCESSIBLE FOR AND CURRENTLY CARRYING OUT  EFFORTS TO TRANSMIT INFORMATION TO PEOPLE ABOUT PAY HERE ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO EVERY DAY EVERY WEEK EVERY MONTH IN ORDER TO MAKE YOUR LIFE AS AS HEALTHY AS POSSIBLE AM AS WELL AS YOU KNOW RUSHING IN UNDER CONDITIONS OF YOU KNOW  PUBLICEAL CRISIS YET IT'S A GOOD GOOD PONTEN AND IT'S CERTAINLY IN MANY OF OUR OFFICERS DO FOCUS ON THIS ABROADER RUBRICKOR AND WELL BEING BUT IT'S PART OF HOW WE NEED I THINK THE THE BROUTER HEALTH SYSTEM AND PUBLIC HEAL SYSTEM TO OPERATE EVEN OUTSIDE OF GOVERNMENT AND THIS I THINK WILL REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE AND SHIFT IN HOW WE THINK ABOUT OUR JOBS WHEN I WENT TO MEDICAL SCHOOL THE VAST MAJORITY THE FOCUS WAS ON DIAGNOSING AND TREATING ILLNESS I IT WAS MUCH MUCH LESS FOCUS ON THINKING ABOUT HOW TO ENHANCE WELL BEING AND WHEN WHE YOU ACCIENT TALK TO PEOPLE IN THEIR LIVES IT BECOMES CLEAR THAT THEY WANT TO DO MORE THAN JUST PREVENT DAGNO SPOILNESS THE THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO WALK THEIR THEIR CHILD DAN THE ISLE THEY WANT AND TO HAVE THE ENDURANCE TO DO THAT THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO ABE INDEPENDENT OFTEN AND CARRY THEIR GROCERIES OR CARRY THEIR LUGGAGE THIS IS WHY I THINK WE'VE GOT ABROADIN OUR FOCUS AND IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND LOOK WHEN I CAME INTO THIS ROLE BY THE WAY I WAS NOT EXPECTING TO SERVEIN GOVERNMENT THIS WAS NOT PART OF SINE FIVE TEN THIRTY YEAR PLAN A WHEN I WAS A A KID I WAS INTERESTED MEDICINE BUT I WAYS TIHT I WAS IN A PRACTICE MEDICINE YOU KNOW LIKE MY DABTED AND LIKE MY  THE CLINNING MY MOMRAN YOU KNOW SET O PUT UP A SHINGLE SEE PATIENCE AND A BE A PRIMARY CURE DOCTOR AND AND FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE WORK I WAS DOING BUT WHAT HAPPENED A TO ME ALONG THE WAY IS A YOU MY I TRAINED IN MEDICINE I GOT INTERSTED TECHNOLOGY SPENT SEVEN YEARS BUILDING ITS ACHNOLOGY COMPANY A THAT WAS FOCUSED ON HELTH I GOT I WAS  BECAME INCREASINLY WORRIED ABOUT THE WAY WE WERE DELIVERING HEALTH CARE I FEL LIKE OUR HELCAR SISTEM WAS BROKEN PEOPLE NEEDED CARE COULDN'T GET IT WAS OFTEN TOO EXPENSIVE TO GET CARE WE WERE FOCUSING ON TREATMENT SOLELY AND NOT ENOUGH ON PREVENTION SO I STARDY GETTING INVOLVED AN IN ADVOCATING FOR A BETTER HEALTHCAR SISTEM WHEN DOCTORS AROUND THE COUNTRY WHEN DESPITE ALL THAT I STILL NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD WORK IN GOVERNMENT BUT IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN A I IS WHEN A PRESENT OF BOMIS TEAM HAD REACHED OUT TO ME AND ASKED IF I BE AN CONSIDERING THE POSITION OF SURGEON GENERAL AND 'S IT WHAT WAYS INTERESTING TO ME ABOUT THIS POSITION AS ETSPECIALLY VERY TDIFFERENT FROM MOST POSITIONS A THET ARE APPOINTED BY PRESIDET IN GOVERNMENT AND THAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE AN INDEPENDENT POSITION SO MY A GENDA THE ISSUES I TOSE I HAON ARE NOT DETERMINED BY A PRESIDENT OR PARTY THEY'RE DETERMINED BY SCIENCE AN THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND THAT'S WHAT'S W GUIDES ME YOU KNOW AND THAT'S WHAT YE THAT'S WHAT GOIDED ME THAT FIRST TERM WHEN I SERVED AND WHAN PRESENT BIND ASKED ME TO COME BACK ON SERVICE SERGEON GENERAL A SECOND TIME THAT' WHAT'S GUIDED ME HERE TOO A SO BIDING UM IS NOT SENDING YOU NOTE SAYING E COULD YOU PUT SOME EFFORT INTO A YOU KNOW GETTING MESSAGES OUT ABOUT YOU KNOW COVID OR COULD YOU PUT MORE EFFORT INTO UM GETTING YOUR TEAM OVER TO MAWE TO DEAL WITH THE YOU KNOW THE YOU AGETY THERE AND WHICH IS A LONG ARC TRAGEDY RIGHT WWE GET THE NEWS AND  IN  IN A BLAST OF THIS HAPPENED AND THEN THE NEXT BLAST COMES IN ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE AND WE FORGET THAT THERE ARE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH CRISES THAT ARE ON GOING UM AND AND THENCE I HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT STARE TO OVERLAP WITH ONE ANOTHER WER'S IT SO AS IT YOUR DECISION UM WHEREAND HOW TO DEPLOY THE FINANCIAL AND AND HUMAN RESOURCES LIKE OOK IT WECAN PUT TEN PEOPLE ON MAE YE WE'RE GOING TO UM PUT A YOU KNOW FIVE PEOPLE IN THE CENTRAL STATES YOU KNOW GOING AROUND TALKING TO UM MAJOR ORGANIZATIONS ABOUT WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO PREPARE FOR THIS WINTER IS THAT HOW IT WORKS IWERE YOU GETTING MEMOS AND U ANOTHER WORDS WHO'S YOUR BOSS EVERYONE HAS A BSS AT SOME LEVEL MINER IS ARE THE LISTENERS OF OF THE SPOTCAST AT SOME LEVEL I'V WORK FOR THEM IT USED TO ALSO BE MY BULL DOG COSTELL UM BUT MY MY BOSS MY WIFE AND MY TWO KIDS FOR FIVE AND SEVEN THEY I I DO WITH THEY TELL ME GOT GOD SO  UM BUT HOW WE MAKE OUR DECISIONS IN THE OFFICE ACTUALLY IT'S IT'S A BID DIFFERENT O WITH THOSE TWO ROLLS SO A WENT WITH A SECOND ONE WITH OVERSEEING THE COMMISSION FOR OR SIX THOUSAND OFFICERS THERE THE THE DECISIONS ABOUT HOW AND WHEN WE DEPLOY OFFICERS AR CLABRDE D SO  YOU NOW WE WORK WITH OTHER COLICS THROUGHOUT THE DEPARTMENT O HEALTHING HUMAN SERVICES WE WORK WITH PEOPLE AND FEMALE CROSS THE ADMINISTRATION BUT WE ALSO WORK W AT STATES SO SOMETIMES STATES OFTEN OFTEN STATES WIN'L PUT IN A REQUEST AND SAY H WE NEED SUPPORT HERE ACAN YOU HELP SO WE'LL WORK WITH COLLEAGUES ACROSS OUR DEPARTMENT TO SAIL IT WILL WE CAN MOBILIZE OUR COMMISSION COR OFFICERS WHAT ASK US CAN YOU MOBILE EYES AND THEN COLLECTIVELY WE WILL SEND A TEAM OUT THERE SO FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE OFFICERS A HELPING IN MOWWE WRIGT NOW I PARTICULARLY WITH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS  WHICH ARE I WORRY ONLY GETTING CONTINUE TO GROW OVER THE WEEKS AND MONTHS AHEAD ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE WHEN IT COMES TO DECIDING WHICH ISSUES WE ENGAGE WITH A PUBLIC ON LIKE IN THIS CASE MENTAL HEALTH HAS BEEN A BIG FOCUS A AREA FOR ME ON ON THAT FRONT WHILE WE CERTAINLY YOU KNOW ARE OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS FROM THE PUBLIC MEMBERS OF CONGRESS SOMETIMES SAY HE CAN YOU HELP THE PUBLIC UNDERSTAND ABOUT THIS ISSUE YOU NOW LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE IDEAS AN OPINIONS BUT THE DECISION ABOUT WHICH ISSUES O FOCUS ON THOSE AR OUR OFFICES AND TO ME THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE PART OF THE REASON OVER TIME I BELIEVE THE PUBLIC CAME TO HAVE SOME DEGREE OF FAITH IN TRUST IN THE OFFICS IS BECAUSE THEY HOPE THAT THE OFFICE WAS FUNCTIONING THE WAY YOU HOPE YOUR DOCTOR'S FUNCTIONING WHICH IS BEING AN INDEPENDENT SOURCE OF INFORMATION FOR YOU IN A SOURCE THAT HAS YOUR BEST INTEREST AT HEART THAT'S NOT BEING PULLED ASIDE BY POLITICAL INTERESTS SOR BY OTHER GENDAS BUT THE PRIMARY AGENDA IS HOW CAN I HELP YOUR HELP AND SO FOR ME LIKE AUGHT WE HAVE TO MAKE AN INDEPEND AN ASSESSMENT THERE AND SACE WHERE IS THE NEED THE GREATEST HERE WHERE CAN WE MAKE THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE SOMETIMES WE MAY NOT BUILD AN AN ISSUTIVE ON AN ISSUE AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THAT ISSUES ON IMPORTANT OR THAT IT'S NOT AFFECTING A LOT OF PEOPLE BEWEHAVE TO MAKE HARD DECISIONS ABOUT WHERE TO PUT LIMITED RESOURCES AND SO WHEN I WAS SERGEON GENERAL THE THE FIRST TIME ONE OF THE BIG ARREAS I FOCUS ON WAS THE OPIO CRISIS T WE'RE DEALING WITH AS WELL AS THE EAST EA CIGARETTE USE AMONG YOUTH BECAUSE WE WERE SEEING A DRAMATIC INCREASE AMONG KIDS IN EA CIGARETTE YOUSE CAN I JUST ASK YOU A SORT INTERRUPT YET I THINK IT'S RELEVANT HERE AM HAS THAT INCREASE CONTINUED OR A E CIGARETTE USE E GA VAPING YE SO WE STILL SEE UNFORTUNE THEY RE THERE 'S BEEN SOME IMPROVEMENTS BUT WE STILL SEE WAI TO MANY KIDS WHO WERE USING A VAPING DEVICEIS EARLY ON AND PART OF WHAT WE DIDN'T FROM OUR OFFICE IS RECOGNIZING THAT WE ACTUALLY ISSUED THE FIRST FEDERAL REPORT ON EST CIGARETTES IN YOUTH WE CALL THE COUNTRYES ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THIS IS A CRISIS WE WORKED WITH MEMBERS OF CONGRESS I TO TALK ABOUT THE KIND OF ACTION WE NEEDED  FROM A LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY PERSPECTIVE AND WORKED WITH COLLEAGUES AT THE FTIATIN GOVERNMENT AS WELL BUT THERE'RE TWO THINGS THAT ARE REALLY MOST IMPORTANT IN GUIDING OUR CHOICE ABOUT PRIORITIES ONE IS DATA WE LOOK AT WHAT THE NUMBER NUMBERS I SHALY TELL US ABOUT THE IMPACT THESE ISSUES ARE HAVING ON THE POPULATIONS WELL AS THE TRAJECTORY ARISE IF SOMETHING'S GETTING DRAMATICALLY WORSE AND PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT MIGHTBE NAREA FOR US TO FOCUS BUT THE OTHER A CRITICAL FACTOR IS WHAT I HEAR FROM PEOPLE ON THE ROAD SO I TRYD TO SPEND AS MUCH TIME AS I CAN VISITING COMMUNIAS A CROSS THE COUNTRY DOING TOWN HALLS MEETING WITH A COMMUTY MEMBERS AND JUST TRY TO FRANKLY JUST LISTEN TO WHAT'S ON THEIR MIND AND THAT'S WHERE I GESS SHOULD GET A LOT OF INFORMATION AS WELL THEY TELL THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY HOW I CAME TO FOCUS ON THE ISSUE OF WONELINESSAN ISOLATION IT WASN'T CAS I POPPED UP IN A REPORT AS BEING THE  LEADING PUBLIC HEALTISIO IN THE COUNTRY ITWAS BECAUSE EVERYWHERE I WAS GOING TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WHATH I WAS TALKING OF COLLEGE STUDENTS TALKING TO RETIRED AMERICANS TALKING TO PARENTS IN RUAL ARIES AN URBANAIRIES I KEPT HEARING THESE STORIES ABOUT PEOPLE WHO FELL LIKE THEY WERE ALL ON THEIR OWN R THEY FELT IN VISIBLE  THEY FELT IF THEY DISAPPEAR TOMORROW NOW ONE WOULD EVEN CARE E THEY FELL AT THEY JUST DIDN'T BELONG AND IT'S HEARTBREAKING TO HEAR THAT FROM ANYONE IT'S PARTICULARLY HEARTBREAKING TO HEAR IT FROM KIDS WHO YOU HOPE ARE ENTERING LIFE AND LOOKING FOR TO WHAT COMES BUT MANY KIDS WEREN'T FEELING THAT WAY THAT IS VERY USEFUL CONTEXT AND WEWILL GET BACK TO THE ISOLATION UM CRISIS AM SUCH AN IMPORTANT INITIATIVE THAT M I IT IS THANK YOU NOW FOR HAVING PUT OUT THE THE MESSAGE ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND ELSEWHERE BUTUM ABOUT THAT UM BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE QUESHIONS I HAVE IN LIGHT OF WHAT YOU JUST SAID IS IT'S CLEAR THAT YOU GOT YOUR EAR TO THE GROUND YOU'RE TALKING TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE UM IT'S ALSO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE HERE FROM YOU AND KNOW UM NOT JUST WHAT'S HAPPENING BUT THAT YOU PERHAPS WANT TO KNOW WHAT A YOU KNOW WHERE THE ISSUES WHY AND WHAT THE UM WHAT THE ACTIONABLE STEPS ARE THAT PEOPLE CAN TAKE RIGHT AND I THINK THAT WE NOW LIVE IN A HYPER CONNECTED WORLD UM SO YOU KNOW IN FACT I'LL JUST AY THAT ONE OF THE REASONS I LAUNCH AS PODCASSES AND TWENTY TWENTY I WAS GOING ON PODCAST TALKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE MAINTAINING SLEEP IN CIRCADIAN RHYTHM AND STUFF FOR MY LAB RELATED TO TRENIC CONUM A JUST ANXIETY UNDER IT UNDER CONDITIONS WHERE I THINK EVERYONE WAS ANXIOUS AND SLEEP RHYTHMS WERE DISERUPTED ET CETERA UM AND I WAS SOMEWHAT SURPRISED THAT I DIDN'T GET A WARNING ON MY PHONE HEY MAKE SURE YOU'RE GETTING WARNING SUNLIGHT YOU KNOW LIKE I I'LL GET A FLOOD WARNING AH YOU NI'LL GET A WARNING THAT I MIGHT GET A WARNING BUT IT'S ONLY A TEST WARNING ILL GET THREE OF THOSE YESTERDAY LIVING HERE NEAR THE COAST BUT UM I DON'T THINK ONCE DURING THE PNDEMIC DID I GET A EMALE OR A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT SAYING IT YOU KNOW IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE INDOORS A LOT YOU'REGOIN TOHAVE TO BE MINDFUL OF MAINTAINING YOUR CIRCADEAN RHYTHM BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT AN WE KNOW BASED ON HUNDREDS OF STUDIES NOW THAT DRIFTS AN CIRCADIAN RHYTHMICITY ARE A PRECURCERTIMENTAL HEALTHISHES I MEAN IN FACT THERE'S A NEW IDEA THAT MANY NOT ALL SUICIDES UM ARE PRECEDED BY A PERIOD OF DISRUPTED SLEEP WHICH IS OU KNOCONOMIC SENSE IN  U AND IT'S NOT A CAUSAL OF COURSE BUT HOW COME DURING THE PANDEMIC WE EACH IN ALL AS U CITIZENS DID NOT GET AN EMALE OR A TAC S MESSAGE SAYING A THESE ARE FIVE THINGS THAT YOU NEED TO DO EVERY DAY TO TRY AND STAY AS STABLE AS POSSIBLE IN THIS VERY UNCERTAIN LANDSCAPE THAT WERE IN WELL IT IS REALLY A QUESTION AND AND I THINK IT'S A IT'S A REASONABLE IN A VERY GOOD SUGGESTION TO SAY THAT A LOOK THERE SHOULD BE A CLEAR AND COMPREHENSIVE WAY THAT WE CAN GET MESSAGES OUT TO EVERYONE I'M LIKE IF WE WERE WORKING IN A HOSPITAL SYSTEN AND THERE WAS A SAFETY ISSUE THAT CAME UP THEY WOULD BE NEMALE SENT TO ALL THE HOSPITAL STAFF MEMBER SAYING HATHIS IS SOMETHINGYOU NEEU TO BE AWARE OF ISO I THINK IT'S A REASONABLE EXPECTATION A PRACTICALLY IF YOU GO BACK THOUGH  LAST TWENTY THIRTY YEARS FR AN AN ON  HEALTH ISSUES THERE HASN'T BEEN  SORT OF AN AGENCY YOU'RE AN ANTITY THAT HAS SENT EMALES OUT TO EVERYONE FIRST ALL HOW TO SEND AN EMALE OUR TEVERAN IN AMERICA IS NOT A SIMPLE PROPOSITION EITHER TECHNICALLY ITS CHALLENGING THERE SOME LEGALLYSSHOUES YOU'D HAVE TO DEAL WITH AS WELL BUT YOU COULD DO A NIGHT WHERE YOU GO SEE AN AND FOX AN B C A B C NER TIMES WELL STREET LET YOU COULD HIT THE RIGHT THE THE RIGHT WING THE LEFT ING AND  TO TATEN THAT' THRILINGTONTE LIKE ONE BUT ONE ONE VIDIO YES WHERE THEY ALL AGREE LIKE A THIS IS IMPORTANT INFORMATION SO A A POLITICAL LIKE YESO I WOULD SAY THAT THAT KIND OF MESSAGING I WOULD SAY THROUGH TRADITIONAL MEDIA CERTAINLY HAS HAPPENED YOU KNOW AN IT HAPPENED DURING COVIT I IT HAPPENED FOR EXAMPLE WHEN IM YOU KNOW EAVIN THE FIRST YEAR OF COVIT I WAS A PRIVATE CITIZEN YOU KNOW IN THE PRIVERATE PRIR ADMINISTRATION BUT I YOU KNW I WATCHED BOTH THEN AND AT THE BEGINNING OF THE ABIDING ADMINISTRATION IM MANY OFFICIALS WOULD GO OUT IN FRONT OF CAMERAS AND SAY HERE ARE THREE THINGS YOU NEED TO DO TO KEEP YOURSELF SAFE  YOU KNOW FRIM FROM COVIT IS AND THAT WAS A BIG QUESTION PEOPLE HAT HOW DO I KEEP MYSELF SAFE OCAT HER THREE THINGS YOU CAN DO A COUPLE OF CHALLENGES I WOULD SAY HERE IS THAT NUMBER ONE EVEN IF YOU HIT ALL THE MAJOR NET WORK  AND CABLE NEWSHOS YOU'RE STILL NOT REACHING EVERYON RIGHT BECAUSE WERE LIVING IN IT IN A SOCIETY WHERE INCREASINGLY PEOPLE IN OR WATCHING TEVI REITHER GETTING THEIR NEWS FROM OTHER SOURCES IM THE OTHER THING THAT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW IS THAT ATTENTION SHIFTS QUICKLY YOU KNOW AINTRADITIOAL METING ALSO FROM ISSUE TO ISSUE AND SO YOU MIGHT GET ECLIP YOU KNOW OUT AT A CERTAIN A DAY OR YOU MIGHT GET ON ALL THE SUNDAY SHOWS FOR EXAMPLE BUT THE NEXT DAY YOU KNOW THAT MESSAGE IS AN NECESSARILY THERE YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S GONE AND PEOPLE'S ATTENTION HAS ALSO SWITCHD OFF TO SO THEY WERE I MEAN I CAN COUNT AND YOU KNOW WE'VE LONG PROBABLY THOUSANDS OF INTERVIEWS AT THIS POINT THAT WE'VE DONE WITH MAINSTRE MEDIA WITH SORT OF YOU KNOW CONCISE MESSAGES ABOUT THREE THINGS YOU CAN DO TO PROTECT YOURSELF ET CETERA AND YOU KNI'M GLAD WE DID THOSE WE GOT TO DO THEM BUT I THINK ONE O THENSE WE THEY DON'T WE DON'T HAVE RIGHT NOW IN THE COUNTRY AND THIS IS AN I THINK A BIT OF AN HEALTH INFOR STRUCTURE CHALLENGE IS WISHE DON'T HAVE A QUICK EFFICIENT WAY TO REACH EVERYONE IN THE COUNTRY WITH A A HEALTH MESSAGE JUST LIKE WHAT YOU SAID YOU KNOW WHATER YOU WANTED TO GET THAT MESSAGE ABOUT THREE THINGS TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM LET SAY COVIT OR THREE THINGS TO DO TO YOU KNOW SUPPORT YOUR HEALTH AND WELL BEING DURING A TIME OF CRISIS ORDURING A TIME OF HEALTH MEN AGAIN OT NOT JUST THE FLOOD WARNING YES THE THE DAILY CAUSE I  I DO THINK THAT MOST OF MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH IS THE RESULT OF DAILY PRACTICE THAT ARE YOU O THE BUILD ON THEMSELVES SORT LIKE COMPOUNDED APOPOUNDED IN H ASTMENTS AND THEN OF COURSE THERE ARE ACUTE CHALLENGES AND CHRONIC CHALLENGES YVACE BUT THER AREINGS OF THAT SORT TOO I I THINK THOSE KIND OF MESSAGES IN TIME OF HEALTH TAT ARE O ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT AS WELL AND YOU MIGH THINK I THINK IN THE SORT OF I THINK FAST PACE CRISIS DRIVEN ENVIRONMENT THAT WE LIVE IN UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE OFTENLESS AR PAYING LESS ATTENTION TO THOSE MAINTENANCE OR AN IMPROVEMENT MESSAGES HAND THEY ARE TO MANAGING THE CRISIS MESSAGES BUT I THINK THAT THEY ARE EQUALLY IS IMPORTANT BUT I DO THINK THEY WHAT YOUR POINTING OUT IS AN INFOR STRUCTURE PEACE THAT THEY NEEDS TO BE BUILT WHICH IS A WAY FOR YOU KNOW HEALTH AUTHORITIES TOO REACH PEOPLE YOU KNOW WHITH INFORMATION QUICKLY AND COMPR EHENSIVELY I'LL TO TELL YOU THAT IN  NINETEEN EIGHTIES WHEN SEE EVERY COUP WAS SERGEON GENERAL ONE THING THAT HE HAD DONE A DONE WHICH WAS INTERESTING AS HE HAD ACTUALLY SENT A LETTER A PHYSICAL LETTER A TO ALL HOUSEHOLDS IN AMERICA ABOUT H IVY PHYSICAL LETTER PHYSICAL LETTER SOME OF OUR LISTENERS WON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS SI YOU READ ABOUT THE HISTORY BOOKS IRS EN HE SHOW US UP IN YOUR MAIL BOX AND YOU OPEN IT AND A OFE SOMETHING ONETO READ BUT IN THIS CANE CASE THIS CASE HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT AH I V ABOUT THE FACT PEOPLE IN KNOW ABOUT IT SO HE WORKED THROUGH AN YOU WITH AS I UNDERSTAND IT WITH A MEMBER OF CONGRESS FOUND  YOU KNOW FAWAY TO DO THIS FROM A FUNDING PERSPECTIVE BUT IT WAS A VERY UNUSUAL MOVE AND ONE THAT WAS NEVER REPLICATED SINCE AND THERE WAS NEVER INFRSTRUCTURE FUNDING TO DO THAT AGAIN AM WHEN I WAS SEARGHED AT A LAST TI YOU KNOWYOU KNOW SOME YEARS AGO AND THEN THIS TIME AROUND ONE OF THINGS I DID DO AS I WAS ABLE TO SEND A PHYSICAL LETTER TO THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY I THE FIRST TIME I WAS ABOUT THE OPIO USE CRISIS AND ABOUT CHANGING OUR PRESCRIBING PRACTICES AND MEDISIS SO THAT WE EXPOSED FEWER PATIENCE TO THE HARM OF OPIOITS WHILE MANGSURE PEOPLE WHO NEEDED THEM ACTUALLY GOT THEM IN TA SECOND TIME IT WAS ABOUT COVIT DEROPEUTICS IT WAS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WHEN WE HAD DATA ABOUT MEDICINES THAT ACTUALLY WORK LIKE PAXOVID THAT WE MAY ACTUALLY OFFERED THEM TO PATIENCE MADE THEM AVAILABLE TO PATIENCE AS WE WERE REALIZING THAT MANY PEOPLE WEREN'T GETTING OFFERED LIFE SAVING MEDIC MEDICATIONS EVEN TOUGH THEY WERE IN HIGRIST'S GROUPS AM SO WE WERE ABLE TO FIND YOU KNOW AND WE AGAIN THERE TOO AT A SORT OF CREATIVELY COBBLE TOGETHER RESOURCES FUNDING IS IS ALL SORT OF YOU KNOW IIS A BEHIND THE SCENE'S GOVERNMENT STUFF BUT E BOTTOMLINE IS IN IN WHAT YOU WANTED AN EMERGENCY A AND WHAT YOU WANT I THINK IN THE LONG TERM IS A SIMPLE CLEAR COMPREHENSIVE WAY THE PUBLIC HELTH MESSAGES CAN GET OUT TO PEOPLE AND TO THIS DAY WHAT WE STILL HAVE TO RELY ON A ART ONE TRADITIONAL CHANNELS LIKE YOU NO TRADITIONAL MEDIA TO COVER THE INITIATIVES WE PUT OUT WHETHER IT TS ON SOCIAL MEDIAN YOUTH MATALHALTHER UNLONELINESS OR ON YOUTH MENAHOTHMORE BROADLY WE REL TO RELY ON ON MYNE CHANNELS WHICH WHICH WE DO AS WELL OR WE AVE A LOOK TO CREATIVE PARTNERSHIPS THAT WE BUILD WITH PEOPLE WHO REACH DIFFERENT AUDIENCES AND THEN TOGETHER WE TRY TO GET OUR MESSAGES OUR OFFICE DOS ALL THREE OF THESE BUT I IT'S A PATCHWORK AND AND YOU KNOW AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS IDEAL BUT IT'S WHAT WE DO NOW I THINK PART OF WHAT THIS REFLECTS IS A BROADER CHALLENGE LIKE IN GOVERNMENT BUT ALLSO IN SOCIETY MORE BROADLY WHICH IS IT WE HAVE VALUED HISTORICALLY PREVENTION AND HEALTH COMMUNICATION VERY LITTLE WE PUT THE MAST MAJORITY OF OUR RESOURCES IN TO TREATMENT STRATEGIES INTO GENTING MEDICATIONS TO PEOPLE INTO DIAGNOSIS AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT DON'T GET ME WRONG BUT WE ARE NOW SEEING WITH MANAHALTISAS ONE EXAMPLE BUT IF WE ONLY FOCUS ON EXPANDING TREATMENT AND DEEPENING ARE WELL OF KNOWLEDGE THERE AND WE DON'T DO ANYTHING TO HELP PEOPLE STAY WELL THE WEE JUST CAN'T KEEP UP I AND I BECAUSE ONE PROBLEM FEEDS THE OTHER EXACTLY THE KIDS THAT ARE STAT LIST AN FIRAD GROWN UP IN TO DAY'S ERA I'D BE ON MY PHONE AND TABLET LATE AT NIGHT CAUSE I WAS UP READING MAGAZONS AND TOLKING FRIENDS ON THE PHONE LADE I SO'S NOT A CRITICISM BUT BUT YOU KNOW DESTRUPTIONS IN SLEEP DESTRUPTIONS IN CIRCATIAN RHYTHM DESTRUPTIONS LACK OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY POOR NEUTRITION SOCIAL SOCIAL ISOLATION I MEAN THESE ARE ALL PILING THE SAND MUCH HIGHER ON THIS IN DES OTHER SIDE OF WHAT YOU DO TERMS OF  HER IM OBVIOUSSTATING THE OBVIOUS YOU KNOW SO IT'S JUST GON CREATE A MOUNTAIN OF ISSUES ON THE OTHER SIDE WHICH PRESUMABLY HAS A LARGER BUDGET IS WHAT I'M SENSING BUT DOESN'T A BUT THERE'S NO WAY THAT BUDGET IS LARGE ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH TAT O ME IS SOMEBODY'S KID FOR INSTANCE IS AM TRYING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF WEATHER NOT TO GO ON PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS AND OR BY THE WAY FOLKS AND OR CHANGE THEIR DI TOREAN TAKE BECAUSE THEY FEEL THEY MIGHT HAVE EIGHTY EHTY FORINCES IM WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO THEY'RE GING TO GOOGLE THEY CAN LISTIN A POT CAST THAT THEY THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO WRITE FIRST TO YOUR ORGANIZATION AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE HIGHEST LEVEL STRINGENCY DAD A SAY ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND A I SHOULD BE ABLE TO TELL THEM ACCURATELY YEAND MAYBE YOU HAVE SOMEBODY CHIME IN FOR THEM I MEAN WE ALL PAY TAXES I PAY FEDERAL IN STATE TAXES EM AND AND AND TO SOME EXTENT HAPPILY SO RIGHT EM ECAUSE IT PAYS FOR PUBLIC WORKS AND AND MANY MANY IMPORTANT THINGS POLICE OFFICERS FIVEWRITERS ET CETERA BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A CHANNEL TO COMMUNICATE WITH PEOPLE BOUT WHAT THEY AND THEIR KIDS AND THEIR RELATIVES CAN DO THEND TO SOME EXTENT IT FEELS LIKE IT IT'S EM IT'S A COLDOSACK IT'S LIKE HOW HOW IN THE WORLD CAN WE GET HEALTHY AGAIN WERE HEALTHIER AS AS A COUNTRY THE PART THAY KEEPS ME UP AT NIGHT IS AND WONIS TOM THE HARDEST DECISIONS I HAVE TO MAKE IN THE OFFICE ARE PUTTING ASIDE ISSUES SAID WE KNOW DESERVE ABOUT MORE TIME AND ATTENTION AH BUT WE JUST REALLY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DEAL WITH YOU KNOW THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE DEALT WITH I'M CERTAINLY PRID MIT TEEM THAT WE WORKED HARD TO TRY TO RAISE A WARENESS OF THE ISSUES WE HAVE TAKEN ON WHETHER IT'S UROUND YOU O SOCIAL MEDIAAND YOUTH A MENTOL HOWTOR WHETH IT'S AROUND ISOLATION ARE GLENICALCLENITION BURN OUT OR OTHER ISSUES IKE THAT BUT THE TRUTH IS THE  THERE'S MORE THAN NEEDS TO BE DONE MORE ISSUES AN EED TO BE TACKLED AND WE HAVE TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT WHAT I THINK OF IS A COR PILLARS OF A HEALTHY LIFE R WHICH ARE SLEEP OUR NUTRICION OUR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OUR SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS LIKE THESE ARE ALL VITAL ELEMENTS TO LIVING A HEALTHY LIFE RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT TEACHING KIDS ABOUT THIS IN SCHOOL RIGHT BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT EDUCATION AND SCHOOL AS A PLACE AND A FORCE THAT SHOULD PERHAP PERAPICATES FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES IT SHOULD LAY A FOUNDATION FOR A HEALTHY LIFE GOING FORWARD THESE ABSOLUTELY ARE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS FOR KITS TO LEARN ABOUT I I THINK IT'S AS IMBORN FOR KITS TO LEARN ABOUT HOW TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS IN THEIR LIFE AS IT IS FRANKLY FOR THEM TO LEARN HOW TO READ IN RIGHT AND I KNOW THAT'S A STRONG SAMENT TO MAKE BUT IT IS TRUE IN TERMS OF ITS CONTRIBUTION TO THEIR THERE A HAPPINESS OR FULFILMENT THEIR HEALTH IN THEIR SUCCESS II I COULD NOT AGREE MORE  WE HAVE A SERIES IT'S OUT NOW WITH A SYCHATRIS UPALCONTY ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH NOT MENTAL ILLNESS ABOUT SELF INQUIRY AND HOW TO USE OF INQURY IN PRACTICES THAT DO NOT REQUIRE AA THERAPIST IN ORDER TO BOLSTERMENT MENTAL HEALTH AM OF COURSE THERIFICE CAN BE VERY USEFUL BUT NOT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS AND NOT EVERYONE FEELS COMFORTABLE OT DOING THAT UM BUT WE ARE BUT ONE CHANNEL EMAND YOU ARE THE GOVERNING BODY FOR THIS AM YOU'RE THE ARMY A NAVY AND MARINE SO TO SPEAK OF OF HEALTH AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN TAKING AG ONE DAILY SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE SOME DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE POD CAST AG ONE IS A VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT'S DESIGNED TO ME ALL OF YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITION NEEDS OF COURSE I TRY TO GET ENOUGH SERVINGS OF VITEMENS AND MINERALS THROUGH WHOLE FOOD SOURCES THAT INCLUDE VEGETABLES AND FRUITS EVERY DAY BUT OFTENTIMES I SIMPLY CAN'T GET ENOUGH SERVINGS BUT WITH AG ONE I'VM SURE TO GET ENOUGH VITEMENTS AND MINERALS AND THE PROBIOTICS THAT I NEED AND IT ALSO CONTAINS ADAPTED INS TO HELP BUFFER STRESS SIMPLY PUT I ALWAYS FEEL BETTER WHEN I TAKE AG ONE I HAVE MORE FOCUS AND ENERGY AND I SLEEP BETTER AND IT ALSO HAPPENS TO TASTE GRIGHT FOR ALL THESE REASONS WHENEVER I'M ASKED IF YOU COULD TAKE JUST

SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THREE K TO AGAIN THAT'S DRINK AG ONE DOT CALM LASH HUBERMENT THERE'S A LOTS MORE TO EXPLORE THERE A WE MAY HAVE TO DO SEVERAL A OF THESE TOGETHER BUT I TO TOUCH ON ALL OF THEM BUT MAY WE CA EM TALK ABOUT A FEW OF THE THINGS THAT IM OUR LISTENERS ASKED ABOUT WHENI SOLICITED FOR QUESTIONS THA I  MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND RESPONSES ACROSS SOCIAL MEDIA IN A VERY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME BUT THERE WERE SOME REDUNDANCY IM ONE OF THINGS THAT I'M VERY CUREOUS CANNIDY ON THAT WHY YERS WHEN I'M REALLY GLAD THAT YOU ASKED A FOLKS IT TI SUBMAT QUESTIONS AND WAS REALL EXCITED TO SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE ASHALLY WROTE IN BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO DIS A TESTAMENT TO HOW YOU'VE DONE SUCH AN INCREDIBLE JOB A BUILDING A CHANNEL TO THE POBLIC TO LET PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THESE TOPICS SAID YOU KNOW THAT ARE SO VITAL TO OUR HEATH AND WELL BEING WHETHER IT'S SLEEP OR FYSICL ECTIVITY OR MENTAL HEALTH AND SO JUST WHAN I THANK YOU FOR THALL THE WORK YOU'RE DOIN TRYN TO HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT HEALTH AND CLEARLY THE FACT THAT FOLKS ARE ENGAGING THEIR SENDING QUESTIONS AND THERE SENDING COMMENTS YOU MEANS THAT YOU'REBUILDING A RELATIONSHIP THERE WITH A LOT OF FOLKS O JUST COULD US YOU FOR DN L THANK YOU THAT THE AUDIENCE OF THE HUBORIN LAPODCASTIS IS THE ONLY REASON WE DO IT I MEAN I LOVE LEARNING AND TEACHING BUT IM THAT'S THE TRUTH SO THEY ARE THE PODCAST AN THE PODCAST IS THEM IM THANK YOU FOR THAT A THERE WERE A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND I ALSO WONDER ABOUT WHY IS IT THAT MANY FOOD ADD IT IS AND PRESERVATIVES AND DIES AND THINGS OF THAT SORT THAT ARE NOT ALLOWED IN EUROPE ARE ALLOWED IN YOU ASK FOOD PRODUCTS 'S A REALLY TOE QUESTION AND DECISIONS ARE ROUND FOOD AN FOOD SAFETY IN PARTICULAR ARE MADE BY THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION SO THAT'S TH F T E IT'S NOT IT'S A SEPARATE THAT AGENT INDEPENDENT AGENCY IT'S NOT ONE THAT OUR OFFICE I IS INVOLVED IN AN SORT OF DIRECTING IN ANY WAY IAND SO WE'RE NOT INVOLVED IN THOSE DECISIONS AND DON'T HAVE INSIDE INTO HOW THEIR MAKING THERE DRAWIN THEIR CONCLUSIONS BUT THEY DO IT IN A PROCESS THAT'S YOU GUIDED BY SCIENCES LIKE THEY DO AND WITH MEDICATIONS WITH DEVICES ET CETERA WITH THAT SAT YOU KNOW I AM CONCERNED THAT DIETARY PRACTICES THE FOOD THAT MANY AMERICANS ARE CONSUMING ARE IN FACT NOT SUPPORTING THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING AND IN MANY WAYS ARE DETRACTING FROM IT WHEN WE LOOK AT HIGHLY PROCESS FOODS ONE OF THE CONCERNS I HAVE THERE IS WE OFTEN SEE SODIUM CONTENT IS VERY HIGH WE SEE THE SUGAR CONTENT IS VERY HIGH AND YOU KNOW THERE ARE CERTAINLY ADDED TIVES IN THERE AS WELL THAT I THINK WE I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE MORE DATA ON THE HACTUAL HEALTH AND BACKS OF THOSE BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR DIET I IS COMPRISED OF HIGHLY PROCESS FOODS IN AMERICA AND AND THAT WORRIES ME THE ALSO OTHER PIECE OF THIS THAT WORRIES ME ARE JUST HOW MUCH WE KNO REFINED SUGARS ARE BEING ADDED TO SO MUCH OF OUR FOODS AND MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT SUGARS ARE ONLY ADDED TO THINGS LIK DESERVE ET CETERA BUT YU LOOK AT SPAGETTI SAUCES SALID DRESS IS SALY DRESSINGS A LOT OF THESE THINGS WHICH WE THINK OF IS SAVOURY PRODUCTS HAVE HAVE SUGAR ADDED TO THEM AS WELL AND SO WE ARE CONSUMING I THINK UNHEALTHY LEVELS OF SUGAR IN OUR DIET WE'RE CONSUMING FAIR AMOUNT OF ADDETIVES GIVEN THE PROCESS FOOD COMPOSITION IN OUR DIET AND I THINK PART OF THE REASON THIS AS HAPPENING AND AND WHON BE VERY CLEAR I DON'T FAULT INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE FOR THE COMPOSITION OF THEIR DIET NECESSARILY BECAUSE WE HAVE ALSO MADE CERTAIN DECISIONS IN OUR COUNTRY ABOUT WHAT WE SUBSIDIZE ABOUT WHAT'S CHEAPER AND MORE EXPENSIVE FOR PEOPLE AND THE CHEAPEST FOODS UNFORTUNATELY ARE OFTEN THE MOST UNHEALTHY FOODS THE MOST HIGHLY PROCESS FOODS IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO LIVES IN THE LOWING COME NEIGHBOURHOOT NUMBER OF THESE NEIGHBORHOODS DON'T EVEN HAVE GROSSERY STORCE IN THEM WHICH IS YOU KNOW TRAGEDY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET FRESH PRODIES ET CETERA A LOT OF TIMES YOURE SHOPPING YOUR GROCERY SHOPPING MAY BE DONE AT A LOCAL CONVENIENT STORE AT A SEVEN ELEVEN OR AT YOU KNOW SOMEWHERE ELSE THEY MAY NOT HAVE LIKE THE ARRAY OF O FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES A YOU AND YOUR FAMILY NEAT I DON'T NO NOWDR HOW THEY HAVE VEGETABLES I THINK THEY HAVE THEY'LL OCCASIONALLY HAVE SOME LEMONS OR APPLES OR ORANGES OF BANANAS BUT WHEN I WALK INTO A CONVENIENT STORE WHAT I SEE IS A PHARMASY I REALLY DO I SEE ALKOHOL KAFIN ENERGY DRINKS THAT HAVE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS IN THEM DESIGN TO STIMULATE DIFFERENT NERMODULATORS LIKE DOPAMINE AND SERATONE AND I SEE NICOTINE PRODUCTS I SEE HIGH SUGAR HIGH HIGHLY PROCESS FOOD KEEP IN MIN I WAS A TEA AJOR IM AN I DRANK MY SLURPES I HAD MY BUTTER FINGERS YOU KNOW WASN'T YOU KNOW BARTSIMSON LIKE IN MY LETHOUDER FINGERS BUT I LIKE THEM BUT BUT IT WAS IT WAS A SMALLER FRACTION OF OF WHAT WE ATE A WHEN WE WERE AT HOME THOSE FOODS WERE EITHER NOT AVAILABLE OR WE WEREN'T WE CERTAINLY WEREN'T ALLOWED TO EAT THEM IN UM AT LIBTUM YNE UM UCESO WHAT'S CLEAR TO ME IS THAT THE F T ER MAKES DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT IS SAFE WHAT'S NOT SAFE BUT FOR INSTANCE OQ THIS LAST YEAR THERE WERE SEVERAL PAPERS PUBLISH AN HIGH QUALITY JOURNAL SHOWING THAT IF PEOPLE EAT JUST HI JUST SWEET AND SAVOURY FOODS COMBINED THAT NARRAL CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN REWIRE THROUGH PROCESS OF NEROL PLOCTASSY THAT DRIVES INCREASED APPETITE AND CHANGES THE RESPONSE TO HEALTHIER FOOD SO THAT THEY DON'T TASTE AS ASSATIATING OQ THAT SORT OF A DU TO A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT I THINK IT WAS AN IMPORTANT SAT OF FINDINGS BECAUSE IT SAID THE BRAIN ACTUALLY CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO THE UM THE VERY A RICH FLAVORABLE FOODS THAT AR ASSOCIATE WITH WITH HIGHLY PROCESS OR EVEN MODERATELY PROCESS FOODS M UM THAT'S JUST A COUPLE OF STUDIES U THERE WAS NOTHIN IN THOSE STUDIES THAT SAID IF YOU EAT THESE FOODS YOU'RE GOING TO DEVELOP CANCER BUT YOU KNOW AT SOME POINT ONE HAS TO AS A CITIZEN A TAX BANG CITIZEN SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF MANY OTHER TAXPING CITIZENS I HAVE TO SO TAKE A STEPBACK TA HOW LONG DO WE WAIT RIGHT DO WE HAVE TO GET A RANDOMIZE CLINICAL TRIAL ABOUT THE YOU KNOW THE YOU KNOW THE FIVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND SICK KIDS THAT GROWINTO SIC ADULTS OM AND THEN RUN A TRIAL WHERE THEY GO ON AT AN ELIMINATION DIET WHERE THEY'RE EATING ONLY ON PROCESS VIGAN OR UN PROCESS O MEAT AND VEGETABLE OR UN PROCES YOU KNOW STARCH AND VEGETABLE DAVING  THEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A THIRTY YEAR HEALTH CRISIS BEFORE THE INTERVENE WHY NOT I MEAN IF I WERE IN CHARGE WHICH I'M NOT AND CLEARLY I WOULDN'T SURVIVE IN A GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION BECAUSE EM WELLTH IE GOT THE UNIFORM DOWN EI WAS RAR THE SAME THING BUT UM A UNIFORM BUT I WOULDN'T BECAUSE I WOULD WANT TO SAY WAIT YOU KNOW WHY NOT ERR ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION WHY NOT SEND OUT THIS A I GENERATE TAX MESSARGS THAT TELLS EVERYBODY IN ALL THE LANGUAGES THAT AMERICAN SPEAK AND CAN UNDERSTAND HEY YOU GET TO MAKE CHOICES ABOUT WHAT YOU EAT BUT YOU SHOULD BE AWARE THAT I'M MAKING YOUR DIET COMPRIZE OF MORE THAN FIFTEEN TO TWENTY PER CENT OF THESE FOODS IT'S POTENTIALLY GOING TO LEAD TO SERIOUS ISSUES DOWN THE ROAD AND THOSE SERIOUS ISSUES ARE EXTREMELY SERIOUS HAVING THE BECITY CRISIS IS REALLY A CRISIS OF BOTH BODY AND BRAIN METABOLIC CHALLENGE UM THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT SO YOU KNOW WHO SETS THE THRESHOLDS YOU KNOW ANOTHER WORDS WH IS IT THAT IN THIS COUNTRY WE HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL PEOPLES START TO GET REALLY SICK AND DYING AND REALLY STRUGGLING BEFORE SOMETHING IS DONE IN THE DIRECTION OF THEIR HEALTH AND I'M NOT BLAMING YOU I JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE IM QUESTION THAT THE WEALTHY PEOPLE I KNOW CARE A LOT ABOUT THEIR FOOD SOURCES AND THEY PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION TO IT AND WHY AREN'T WE ALLOWING EVERY ONE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE BETTER CHOICES SO THIS IS THE RIGHT QUESTION AND THIS IS SOMETHING I I THINK ABOUT A LOT AS I I'M CONSCIOUS ABOUT WHAT I EAT BUT I ALSO TALK TO FOLKS AROUND THE COUNTRY AND REALIZE A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T HAVE OITHER THE INFORMATION A ORE THER RESOURCES ACTUALLY PURCHASE HEALTHY FOOT RIGHT AND TO KNOW LIKE WHAT'S CAN BE GOOD FOR THEM FOR THEIR FAMILIES THIS IS WHY YU N I MENTION WE HAVE A LIST OF ISSUES THAT YOU KNOW WE WOULD WORK ON YOU KNOW WE HAD MORE MORT MORE RESOURCES THIS IS ACTUALLY WANT OF THEM BECAUSE TO ME ONE OF THE MOST COMMON QUESTIONS PEOPLE ASK IS WHAT SHOULD I EAT THAT'S SIMPLE BUT IT'S IT'S VEXING IT'S COMPLICATED IT'S INCREDIBLY CONFUSING IF YOU GO ON LINING TO TREAT A SEARCH FOR INFORMATION AND IT'S A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF WARE IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN OBJECTIVE SCIENTIFIC AUTHORITY THAT CAN COME AN AND SPEAK ON BROAD PRINCIPLES AROUND DIET THAT CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT WE KNOW AND DON'T KNOW SO THE HEAR'S IT IMPORTANT THING I THINK A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE MAY SEE SOMETHING IS A YOU KNOW ON THE MARKET THEY MYG REDLIST OF INGREDIENTS THEY DON'T RECOGNIZE HALF OF THEM CAUSE THE'R ADDATIVES BUT THEY FIGURE WELL IF IT'S THERE THAN IT MUST HAVE BEEN STUDIED FOR THIRTY FORTY YEARS AND THERE MUST BE NO HARMFUL CONSEQUENCE IS RIGHT BUT SOMETIMES THINGS ARE ARE PUT OUT THERE BECAUSE WE HAVE SHORT TURMED ATA THAT SAYS THAT THEIR O KE AND THERE MIGHT BE BUT THERE MAY BE NEED FOR MORE LONG TURMD AY TO HELPING PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT DO WE KNOW WHAT O WE NOT KNOW IS IMPORTANT SO THAT PEOPLE CAN MAKE DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES BASED ON HOW MUCH RIST THEY WANT TO TAKE THE OTHER THNG THO THE CONCERNS ME HERE ANDREW IS I YOU LOOK IL I HAVE OTO I HAVE A BIASHERE AND MY BIAS IS THAT I AM WORRIED ABOUT THE YOU KNOW ADDATIVES AND OTHER PRODUCTS WE HAVE IN FOOD THEY DON'T HAVE LONG TERMD ATA A THAT'S CLEAR IN TERMS OF HELTHERESTS AND'S O BECAUSE OF THAT LIKE MY BIASIS GENERALLY TO THINK HOW CAN WE GET PEOPLE A YOU KDON'T MINABLY OR LESS PROCESS FOODS AND HOW CAN WE GET THE MORE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THAT MORE AVAILABLE TO THEM BUT WE'VE GOT TO NOT ONLY MAKE THE INFORMATION OFVAILBLE BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE FROM A COST PERSPECTIVE IF YOU DON'T HAVE A GROCERY STORE IN YOUR COMMUNITY IF VEGETABLES AND FRUITS COST THREE X WHA T OTHER FOODS TO THA SYN BE A PROBLEM RIGHT TO CHANGE DIET THE OTHER THING WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT YOU KDON'T FOOD COMPANIES YOU KNO A LOT OF DO A GREAT JOB OFJACTU TRY TO GET HEALTHY NUTRICIOUS FOOD OUT TO PEOPLE AN OWN CUDOS TO THEM BUT I WORRY ALSO THAT THEREIS AN INSENIVE ALSO TO JUST TRY TO SELL MORE AND MORE ND MORE OF YOUR PRODUCT AND ONE OF THE WAYS TO DO THAT IS TO TREAD A HACK A THE BODY THE KIND OF FIGURE OUT OCCABLE WHAT KIND OF SYNTHETIC ATITIVES COULD I PUT TOGETHER HERE OR WHAT KIND OF A COMBINATION OF NUTRIANS COUND HAVE PUT TOGETHER THAT WILL GET PEOPLE COMING BACK FOR MORE AND MORE AND MORE WE SALL THIS IN THE NICATINE INDUSTRY YOU SAW THE NICTINITY YOU ALSO I WOULD SAY ANOTHER INPERILLELS YOU SEE IT IN SOCIAL MEDIA IS WELL WERE THE BUSINESS MODEL OF THE SOCIAL IMEDIATE PLATFORMS IS BUILT ON VOLUME OF USE RIGHT HOW MUCH TIME AM I SPENDING ON THE PLATFORMS IT'S NOT QUALITY OF TIME IT'S QUANTITY OF TIME RIGHT SO IF THAT'S THE BUSINESS MODEL THEN YOU'RE GOING TO DESIGN YOUR PLATFORM TO MAXIMISE HOW MUCH TIME SOME ONE SPENDS ON THEM REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT'S DETACTING FROM SLEEP DETRACTING FROM INPERSON INTER ACTION DETRACTING FROM ANYTHING ELSE HSS HEALTHY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THAT MAY BE CAUSING CERTAIN HARMS RELIC THE BUSINESS MODELL DICTATES YOU KNOW IN MANY WAYS HOW THESE THINGS ARE DESIGNE AND TAT APPLIES I THINK TO FOOD IS WELL SO WHICH IS WHY I THINK IT'S INICOMBENT UPON US TO BE PARTICULARLY CAUTIOUS A WITH HIGHLY PROCESS FOODS FOODS THAT FOODS THAT HAVE ADDITIVES AND TO UNDERSTAND HOW IS HIS IMPACTING OUR BRAIN HOW'S THAT IMPACTING OR SETIETY HOW IS IT ON LEADING PETENTIALLY TO GREATER INGESTION THAT IS HEALTHY AND LEADING TO THINGS LIKE OBESITY WHICH HAVE A WHOLE HOSTS OF OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS FROM CANCER TO ARTHURITE IS TO DIBEDIES IS AND HART DISEASE ASSOCIATED WITH IT THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS IS A AS A CITIZEN IS A FATHER OF TWO YOUNG KIDS WHO TRY TO BRING THEM UP AT THE HEALTHY LIFE CELL THOS AR THE QUESTIONS THAT I WOULD WANT TO KNOW THE ANSWERS TO IT'S ON OF THE REASONS I THINK THESE KIND OF OBJECTIVE REPORTS ARE SO IMPORTANT FOR THE PUBLIC I'M STRY TO SEE THE THE SCOPE OR THE PROBLEM IN THE MECHANICS INVOLVED IN TR IND TO ALLEVIATE THESE ISSUES ARE COMPLEX II SEE THAT WELL THEYAREN'T ALSO THING ONE THING IS IS IMPOINT TO DO TIT TO IS YOU NEED TO HAVE AUTHORITIES THAT CAN SPEAK TO THESE ISSUES BETTER INSOLATED FROM POLITICAL RETRIBUTION RIGHT SO AND TO EXPLAIN THIS I YN TO THAT YE LOOK IIMEAN LISTEN A SOMEBODY IFORGIVE ME FOR INTERRUPTING BY SOMEBODY WHO FROM TIME TO TIME WILL AM MAKE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS BUT WILL OFFER INFORMATION ABOUT POPOTENTIAL ACTIONABLE ITEMS NO THINGS THAT PEOPLE COULD DO OR NOT DO ACCORDING TO A COUPLE OF STUDIES THAT COME HAVE COME OUT I'M HAVE COME UNDER INTENSE SCRUTINY FROM MY COLLEAGUES AM WHO ARE LIKE WAIGHT THAT'S NOT A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL HOW CAN YOU DO THAT AND YET I KNOW FROM BEING IN THIS FEELD FOR A LONG TIME THAT FOR INSTANCE THE EMERGING THERAPIECE FOR FOR PITIOSTY AND DEPRESSION THAT ARE NOW BASED ON FEDERAL FUNDING FOR THINGS LIKE A AND I'M NOT RECOMMENDING THIS BY THE WAY FOR CHILDREN ARE FOR EVERYBODY BUT FOR INSTANCE THE A MACREDO SYLICIDE BEN THEYRA PEUTICALLY SUPPORTED A LEGAL USE OF SYLICIDEIN FOR FOR NA MAJOR DEPRESSION THE DATO THERE ARE THEY'RE NOT PERFECT BUT THEYRE PRETTY DAWN GOOD COMPARED TO THE MAJOR ESSUSS OR EYES AM BUT FOR YEARS IF IF AN ACADEMIC SAID THAU THE WORDS I JUST SAID THEY LOSE THEIR JOB ONLY A INSTANTANEOUSLY CAUSE THEI'R CONTROLLD SUBSTANCES AM THAT'S I THAT'S TO DO BUT THEN THEIR NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT HERE THAT ARE JUST ABOUT MAKING BETTER CHOICES ABOUT THINGS TO AVOID RIGHT IF PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD I THINK THAT AM I IS SUGAR POISON WHILE SOME OF MY AUDIENCE WILL SAY SUGAR'S POISONOUS AS ADDICTIVE IS COQING LUCK IT IS NOT AS A DICTIVE IS COQINE OR HAROINE IT IS NOT HOWEVER IF A CHILD OR ADULT IS EATING VERY SWEET OR VERY SAVORY FOODS OF ANY KIND CONSISTENTLY IF THOSE ARE NOT AM HEALTHY FOODS OR IF THEY ARE IF THEY CONTAIN UN HEALTHY ADITIVES OVERTIME THE BRAIN WILL REWIRE SO THAT HEALTHY FOODS DON'T TASTE AS GOOD RIGT THEY WON'T BE THE CHOICES THAT PEOPLE MAKE AN YOU R GON AND UP WITH A SICK INDIVIDUAL PERIOD AND I DON'T THINK WE NEED ONE MORE CLINICAL TRIAL FUNDED BY FEDERAL TAX DOLLARS TO SUPPORT THAT STATEMENT WHAT I'M TRYING TO GATHER S THAT YOU'RE A VERY RATIONAL GROUNDED BROAD THINKING INDIVIDUAL NOT JUST SAYING THAT CAUSE YOU'RE SITTING HERE AND YOU'RE TRAINED IN MEDICINE AND YOU UNDERSTAND THE SCIENCE OF BUT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THE MEANS AT YOUR DISPOSAL TO PUT OUT A CALL THAT SAYS HAY FOLKS HAVING SOME SUGAR EVERYONE SMILE TREATING THE KIDS TO ICE CREAM GRATE BUT IF EIGHTY PER CENT OR MORE OF THE DIET IT OF OUR KIDS ISN'T MADE UP OF MINMALLY YOUR NON PROCESS FOODS THEI'RE BRAINS ARE GOIN TO BE REWIRED AND UNHEALTHY WAYS AND YOU CAN ALMOST EXPECT THAT THERE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME HEALTH CHALLENGE IN THE FUTURE THAT MAY NOT BE AM YOU KNOW OTISM OR SCHISAFRENIA BUT IS GOING TO BE A MAJOR HEALTH CHALLENGE OF AND THAT IS SERIOUS AND NOWSE THE TIME TO INTERVENE BY AVOIDING CERTAIN THINGS YE AND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT LOOK IT'S A FREE COUNTRY AT THAT LEVEL YOU'RE WELCOME TO DO IT BUT YOU BE BETTER OFF SPENDING EX NUMBER OF DOLLARS ON THESE HEALTHIER FOODS YEW BECAUSE THERE'S ALSO AND WE KNOW THIS FROM MY COLLIALLYCRUMBS LABORATORYT STANFORD THAT EVEN THE MERE KNOWLEDGE THAT CERTAIN FOODS ARE NUTRICIOUS CAN LEAD TO MORE SATIETY FROM EATING THOSE FOODS AT THE LEVEL OF HORMON RELEASE NOT JUST PSYCHOLOGICALLYOU'RE TELLING YOURSELF OF THE ORANGES AS TASTY AN AND FILLING AS A CANDYBAR BUT THE UNDERSTANDING OF OF THE FACT THAT IT IS NUTRICIOUS ACTUALLY LEADS TO SHIFTIN PATTERNS OF OF YOU KNOW GRELLIN SECRETION ET CETERA THAT THAT  SHAIN'T SO PEOPLE CAN BE FEEL BETTER ON A A HEALTHIER SLIGHTLY LOWER CALLERY NUTRIENT EN RICH DIET A HEALTHY PROTINES AND FRUITS OF VEGETABLES AND IT'S NOT A MINE TRICK IT'S ITS PHYSIOLOGY O ANYWAY I I I THINK UM I FEEL YOUR PAIN RT FRANKLY AND I'LL TEL YOUTOOK SOMETHING AS PEOPLE AS E ONE CH HUS GOAND SAY COUPLE OF STATEMENT TO YOU JUST SAID WHEN THAT WE FIND LIK WIRE WHYS TIME NEEDED TO PRAPSON MET THOT OUR RESERCINATED ET CETERA HERE'S ICHALLY WYLEK I KNOW IT IN TO DAYSAN AGE IS EASY TO JUST GO IN LIKE RATTLEOFF OFF OUN A OFTICOFS STATEMENT IN SER SHOOT FROM THE OCAN  MY SOCIAL MEDIOT CHANNELS AND A REALLY WAY TO GET THE WORD OUT TO MILLIONS I APPRECIATEN I MAY Y UP ON THAT BUT I'LL TAKE THE ONE OF THE REASON WHONE THINGS WE ALWAYS TO DO RECOGNIZING THAT WHEN WE PUT OUT STATEMENTS THAT PEOPLE PEOPLE ONE THEY THEY TRUST ITS COMING FROM A SCIENTIFIC AUTHORITY AN THAT IT'S BEEN VETED RIGHT SO WE PUT THE EFFORT AND TIME INTERVENTING THIS THOROUGHLY WE CHECK SOURCES WE LOOK OF THE DAYT THAT WE TALK TO EXPERTS WE THINK ABOUT HOW TO COMMUNICATE THIS IN THE RIGHT WAY THAT'S THE WORK BEHIND THIS SCENES WORK SRE ITHAT WE DO BEFORE WE PUT OUT SAID REPORTS AND AN INITIATIVES BECAUSE WE WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE HAVE CONFIDENCE YOU KNOW IN IN WHAT THEYRE HEARING WE ALSO KNOW THAT WHEN WE PUT OUT INITIATIVES THAT OTHER PEOPLE BUILD ON THEM PHILANTHROPISTS YOU KNOW AN AND FOUNDATIONS WILL THAN THINK ABOUT SHOULD IVE FUND WORK IN THIS AREA YOU KNOW SCHOOLS AND WORK PLACES WILL THINK ABOUT SHIFTING SOME OF THEIR PRACTISE POLICY MAKERS WILL ALSO THINK ABOUT LEGISLATION O THAT THEY MAY I WANT TO DESIGN BASE ON THAT SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE I IT'S REALLY SOLID BUT THE POINT I WAS MAKING WHEN I SET ALSO THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT NOT JUST OUR IFFIS BUT O FOLKS WHO ARE YOU KNOW IN PUBLIC HELT THEN WHO ARE IN MEDICINE WHO ARE TRY TO SPEAK TO THE PUBLIC ABOUT THEIR HEALTH THAT THEY ARE PROTECTED FROM A RETRIBUTION ATTACXIS THIS IS WHAT I MEANT WHICH IS THAT SAYING THINGS ABOUT DIET SAYING THINGS ABOUT TOBACCO THESE CAN BE CHALLENGING FOR SOME FOLKS BECAUSE THEI ARE INDUSTRIES BUILT AROUND THESE RIGHT WHICH MAY NOT ALWAYS LIKE WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY IF IT HURTS THEIR BUSINESS MODEL I' OR THEIR BOTTOM LINE AND THEY MAY THEN LEAN ON APOLITICAL LEADERS ELECTED LEADERS OTHER TO THEN TRY TO SILENCE YOU OR SHUT YOU UP AND I'LL TELL YOU I'VE EXPERIENCE THIS IN THE PAST YOU KNOW EN IR WAYS CERTAIN GENERAL DURING MY FIRST TERM I HAD ISSUED TO A DKEY REPORTS ONE WAS ON ALKOHOL DRUGS AND HEALTH ABOUT THE ADDICTION CRISIS AND THE OTHER WAS ABOUT THE ECIGARETTE CRISIS AMONG YOUTH I WILL TELL YOU THAT THEY WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY UNHAPPY THAT I WAS ISSUING THE FIRST FEDLE REPORT ON YE CIGARETTES I'M FOLKS WHO FELT THAT HEY I'M IS SOON TO MAKE FOLKS UNHAPPY ITS IN A CREAT POLITICAL PRESSURE OR I IT'S CONTCRADLE A LOT OF PROBLEMS I SIMILARLY WITH ALCOHOL DRUGS AND HEALTH THERE'RE MANY FOLKS WHO SAID HEY IF YOU DO THIS YOU'RE REALLY GON UPSET THE ALCOHOL INDUSTRY DO YOU REALLY MEED TO HAVE ALCOHOL IN THE REPORT WHY DON'T YOU JUST FOCUSS AN OTHER DRUGS I'M WANT YOU TAKE ALCHOLL OUT OF THE TITLE YOU KNOW ALL OF THESE  SORT OF UNOCONCERN YORE REALIN YOU THIS SO SOA TER PEOPLE WHO GET PAID BY THE ALCAL INDUSTRY ON THESE ARE PEOPLE IN GOVERNMENT WHO ARE READING THE TEA LEAVES AND WHO WO ARE SUPPORTEDE OF THE WORK WE'RE DOING BUTTER THING HEY LIKE YOU'RE GINGTO REALLY UPSETTLE LOT OF PEOPLE AND IS IS LTHRY AND ALSTO GET A HELPFUL LOT OF YET WEL THIS IS WHAT IT COMES OUT TO THIY IT WELL AND IF YOU UPSET FOLKS THAN THEY'E BEEN A TROTED FIRE YOU TON A TREAD TO ALL THESE THINGS TO WHICH HONESTY LIKE MY MY RESPONSE TO A LOT OF THESE AND THE REASON WE JUST PUT THEM OUT ANYWAY WAS BECAUSE I SAID WTHE WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN IS I GET FIRED AND THAT'S OQET YOU KNOW IF I IF I GO OUT KNOIN I DID THE RIGHT THING HERE THEN I'M FINE WITH THAT I'M NOT LOOKING TO BUILD A LIFE LONG CAREER IN GOVERNMENT I'M NOT DOING THIS JOB TO IKE YOU NOW GET TO THE NEXT THING ON THE LATTER OR LIKE THIS IS ABOUT SERVING FOR THE TIME I CAN I WANTING BEABLE TO GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT LOOK MYSELF IN THE MIRROR AND KNOW I DID SO WITH INTEGRITY I'M SO THET WAS AN EASY DECISION FOR ME BUT BUT MY POINT IS THAT LIKE WE HAVE TO BE THOUGHTFUL THAT IN THESE ISSUES SAID THEYARE GOING TO BE HEAD WINDS RIGHT I'M SURE IN YOUR CASE FOR EXAMPLE YOU PROABLY GOT AND PUSH BACK FROM FOLKS ABOUT TALKING ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS THAT MAY HAVE RANKLED ILL FOLKS WHO MAY HAVE HAD AN INTEREST IN THOSE ISSURES NOT SO CAT YOU KEEP TALKING ABOUT THEM AS AS YOU SHOULD AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR THAT I'M BUT THIS IS I SPE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT AT A TIME WHERE I THINK PUBLIC TRUST IN ARE INSTITUTIONS MORE BROADLY AND IN SCIENCE AND IN MEDICINE I'VE TAKEN A HIT OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND I THINK IT'S OF TIME WE'R WE HAVE TO BE EVEN MORE VIGILANT THOSE OF US IN MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WE DO IS BASE O DATA THAT WERE TRANSPARENT ABOUT WHY WE'RE SAYING WHAT WE'RE SAYING THAT WE'RE ALSO CLEAR ABOUT WHAT WE KNOW AND WHAT WE DON'T KNOW SO THAT IF RECOMMENDATIONS CHANGE O WERETIME PEOPLE RECOGNIZED THAT THIS ISN'T NECESSARILY FLITFLOPPING YOU SHOULD CHANGE YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS IF THE DATA CHANGES I IF THE CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE SO I KNEMAT THIS IS ALL PART OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE GOT TO DO BUT TO ME THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THE WORK THE INTEGRITY BEHIND OUR WORK IN PUBLIC HALT IS NOT JUST ABOUT THE ISSUE WERE TAKEN ON TO DAY IT'S ABOUT THE TRUST THAT WE NEED TO REBUILD I IN THE FIELD MORE BROADLY ENDERSTAN CORRECTLY IF YOU WERE TO FOR INSTANCE A PUT OUT A CALL THAT SAYS YOU KNOW THERE ARE FOOD ATATIVES THAT ARE ALOWED IN THE YOU ASK THAT ORE NOT ALLOWED IN EUROPE THAT MAYBE OF RISK WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH DATA AT AT PRESENT TO SAY TO AVOID THESE THINGS BUT HERE'S A KIND OF A YELLOW ZONE YOU KNOW YOU GREEN KNOWN TO BE SAFE RED CLEARLY KNOWN TO BE UNSAFE YELLOW WE JUST DON'T KNOW YET NOT ENOUGH DATA UM SO HERE'S WHAT MY RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE FOR MY CHILDREN YET SFREE COUNTRY YOU KNOW UM THER PEOPLE TO ARGUE IT IT'S NOT BUT AT LEAST AT THE LEVEL OF WHICH FOODS YOU WANT TOBUY WITH YOUR OWN MUDG IT UM TIT'S IT'S A FRE COUNTRY SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT UM YOU GET MESSAGES THAT WARNINGS ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS COULD LEA TO PUSH BACK BUT IF I HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT THERE'S SOMETHING AND I'M NOT A CONSPIRACY CUROUS BUT THERE HAS TO BE EITHER THE PEOPLE THAT ARE SAYING LOOK THERE COULD BE PROBLEMS ARE JUST FRICTION OVERSE THERE JUST DON'T LIKE ANY ONE TO BE ANGRY AT ANY ONE WERE UM THERE THERE MUST BE SOMEINCENTIVE FOR THINGS TO REMAIN QUIET MEAN MEANTELY THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT HAD PROBLEMS SAYING H TO DO THINGS OR TO NOT DO THINGS THAT HAD THAT UPSET COMPANIES ERE SHUT DOWN COMPANIES OR WERE ELE ATED COMPANIES AND THERE SUCCESS SO I'M CONI'D LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THA THE AACT CONTOUR THIS TE LOOK ON I THINK AND THIS IS NOT TO DISOMELAR FORYTHING WHAT HAPPENS AND IN OTHER INDUSTRIES BUT IT'S EEN A WHENEVER YOU YOU DO SOMETHING AND WHETHER'S IN THE PRIVATESATUREN GOVERNMENT PEOPLE WE WITH WHERE THE PROSE CONS WHAT'S TO PUSHBACK ON AGET HOW TO I DEAL WITH THAT PUSHBACK RIGHT IAND PUSHBACK ISN ALWAYS A BAD THING RIGHT IF YOU GET PUSHBOK FROM THE PUBLIC PEOPLE HEY THAT DOES MAKE SENSE TO ME SETHRA THAT'S YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO THAT AND AND USE IT TO INFORM YOUR APPROACH BUT THAT'S THE PUBLIC WHOSE YOUR JOB IS TO SERVE I TIME  PUSHBACK FROM COMPANIES IS IS DIFFERENT RIGHTSO WHEN PUSHBACK COMES FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE A FINANCIAL INTEREST I IN THE PRODUCT THAT YOU MAY BE COMMENTING ON THEN YOU YOU'VE GOT TO BE YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE NEVER ONE SO THAT YOU KNOW HOW TO HAD TIMITIGATED AND WELL PEOPLE MAY TAKE DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO THIS MY APPROACH AS A PUBLIC OFFICIAL AS SURGEON GENERAL HAS BEEN TO SAY IT THE END OF THE DAY LIKE I'M HAPPY TO TO HEAR FROM ANY ONE INTERMS OF THEIR CONCERNS ARE PUSHBACK BUT THE AND THE DAY WHAT'S GOIN TO GUIDE MY DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT WE ISSUES WE TAKE ON WHAT DECISIONS WE MAKE AND WHAT WE SAY TO THE PUBLIC IS GIN TO BE WHAT IS IN DRIVEN BY SCIENCE AN THE PUBLIC INTERESTS AND IF THAT MEANS IT'S POLICALY INCONVENIENT THATS OKA IF THAT MEANS THAT YOU KNOW SOMETHING HAPPENS YOU KNOW IT'STO MY JOB THAT'S O KATE TOO YOU KNOW LIKE WE LOOK THE BOTTOM LINE HIS LIFE IS SHORT WE KNON'T NO MUCH TIME WE HAVE HERE WE MAY AS WELL MAKE THE TIME WE HAVE COUNT WE MUSTN'T DO THE THINGS ITHAT THAT ARE RIGHT IND THAT NASERVE PEOPLE THAT'S MI SOMPEF LOSS HIN MY PARENTS SOBBING WHEN I WAS GROWING ON STHAT'S THA OF THE PROACHIPE I BRING TO THIS AND THAT'S WHY IF WE WERE TO DO LET'S SAY AN INITIATIVE ON DIET I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THEM THE THINGS T WE WOULD SAY WOULD BE PERTURBING I TO FOLKS WHO HAD A FINANCIAL INTERESTS IN INDUSTRY CAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT THE CURRENT SET UP IN INDUSTRY IS SERVING THE PUBLIC WELL II THINK WE HAVE MADE UNHEALTHY FOODS CHEAP THAT'S A PROBLEM WE'VE MADE HALTHY FOODS EXPENSIVE THAT'S A PROBLEM WE'V PUT HEALTH FROM A DIETARY PERSPECTIVE OUT OF REACH FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICANS THAT IS A FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM AND WE'VE ALSO DISEMPOWERED PEOPLE WIBUTBY NOT GIVING THEM THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED TO MAKE DECISION SO EVEN IF YOU HAVE RESOURCES I GAN'T HERY THEIR PEOPLE TISNING TO THIS POD CAST A MANY MORE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO GO TO THE GROCY STORIAGES FEEL CONFUSED LIKE WHAT ON EARTH SHOULD I BUY WHAT'S HEALTHY WHAT'S O C ANY MORE A IT'S JIS HARD TO KNOW AND SO I THINK WE'VE DONE A DISSERVICE BY NOT DOING MORE TO HEALP THE PUBLIC UNDERSTAND AND ACCESS I HEALTHY FOODS AND AGAIN IT'S WHY IT'S AN ISSUE THAT YOU KNOW THAT THEN IT WAS ON OUR LISTS OF ISSUES THAT WE WOULD WANT O WORK ON CAUSE I THINK THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH NEED HERS IS IMMENSE ID LIKE TO JUST TAKE A BRIEF BREAK AND THANK ONE OF OUR SPONSORS WHICH IS ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTROLITE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS PLENTY OF SALT SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM THE SO CALLED ELECTROLITES AND NO SUGAR NOW SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS IN YOUR BODY IN PARTICULAR TO THE FUNCTION OF YOUR NERVE CELLS ALSO CALLED NURANS NOW PEOPLE OF COURSE HAVE VARYING LEVELS OF REQUIREMENTS FOR SODIUM SO PEOPLE WITH HIGH PRETENSION OR PREHIGH PRETENSION PROBABLY SHOULDN'T INCREASE THEIR SODIUM HOWEVER MANY PEOPLE ARE SURPRISED TO FIND THAT BY INCREASING THEIR SODIUMEN TAKE THEY ARE ABLE TO FUNCTION BETTER COGNIVELY AND PHYSICALLY N THAT'S BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE SPECIALLY PEOPLE ARE FALLING LOW CARBOHYDRATE OR EVEN MODERATE CARBOHYDRATE AND REALLY CLEAN DIETS OFTENTIMES ARE ESCREETING A LOT OF WATER AND ELECTROLITES ALONG WITH IT AND SIMPLY BY INCREASING THEIR ELECTROLITE INTAKE USING ELEMENT THEY JUST FEEL BETTER AND FUNCTION BETTER I TYPICALLY DRINK ELEMENT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP IN ORDER TO HYDRATE MY BODY AND MAKE SURE I HAVE ENOUGH ELECTROLITES AND WHILE I DO ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL TRAINING AND CERTAINLY I DRINK ELEMENT IN MY WATER WHEN I'M IN THE SAUNA AND AFTER GOING IN THE SANNA BECAUSE THAT CAUSE IS QUITE A LOT OF SWEATING IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMENTE DOC CAM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE AGAIN THAT'S DRINK ELEMENT ELEEMENTY DOT CAM SLASH HUBERMEN IHAVE A QUESTION ABOUT TRUST IN BIG INSTITUTIONS AND PUBLIC HEALTH INITIATIVES IN GENERAL UM THE QUSHIONIS ABOUT MASKS UM EARLY IN THE PENDEMIC AS I RECALL WE WERE TOLD THAT MASKS WERE NOT NECESSARY THEN WE WERE TOLD THEY ARE NECESSARY AND I THINK FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT FLIP IN MESSAGING UM LANDED LIKE APPARENT TELLING THEIR TEAN AGE KID TO ALWAYS WERE A SEAT BELT BUT THEND YOU LOOK INTO THE FRONT SEAT AND COMMANDAWN OUR WEARING SEAT BELTS AND AS ANYONE HAS BEEN AROUND TEAN AGERS TER HAS BEEN ONE YYOU MAKE THAT MISTAKE ONCE YOU'RE NOT MAKING IT AGAIN AND YOU MAY NEVER RECOVER FROM THAT PARTICULAR EXAMPLE IN OTHER WORDS THE PUBLIC FELT LIKE THERE WAS A SWITCH OF MESSAGING BUT WHAT I DON'T RECALL HAPPENING WAS A LIKE A HEY WE GOT THAT ONE WRONG SO SORRY ON US YOU KNOW WHAT THE NEW DATE I SAY BLANK WHAT I RECALL WAS A MESSAGE OF DON'T AND THEN DO BUT THERE WASN'T A LOT OF EM KIND OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF OF HOW CHALLENGING THE SITUATION WAS IT WAS JUST A LOT OF TOP DOWN MANDATES AND IN MY OPINION AND THIS IS JUST MY OPINION I THINK THAT LED TO A PRETTY RAPID DISTRUST OF SUBSEQUENT MESSAGES FROM WHICH WE STILL HAVEN'T REALLY RECOVERED UM AND SO WHY DO YOU THINK IT SO CHALLENGING FOR PUBLIC FACING OFFICIALS TO JUST SAY LOOK DOING THE BEST WE CAN AT THE MOMENT SCREWED UP BEFORE CHANGING THE MESSAGE AND OW MAY CHANGE AGAIN NAVIGATING THIS AND IN REAL TIME ITS DYNAMIC YE PLEASE STAY WITH US BECAUSE YOU KNOW GOES WITHOUT SAYING THERE'S BEEN A HUGE CHASM AROUND JUST IN RELATED ISSUES YET IT LOOK THIS IT'S IMPORTANT QUESTION AND LO I I'M ALWAYS I WANT TO BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT A YOU KNOW HOW I COMMENT ON WHAT WAS DONE IN THE FIRST YEAR O THE PANDAMIC I WAS I WAS AS HISAND AS OUTSIDE GOVERNMENT AND I DON'TKNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN SIDE GOVERNMENT IN TERMS OF THE A THE DECISIONS I REMAN MADE THERE BUT I DO KNOW SOMETIMES FOM MY EXPERIENCE ANY BOLA AND INSIKA DURING THOSE AEXPERIENCES WE HAD AS THE COUNTRY THAT IN THE YOUW IN THE FOG OF WAR WHEN EVERYTHING'S COMING AT YOU SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION ALL THE TIME RIGHT SO II WANT TO GIVE SOME OF THOSE FOLKS WHO WERE THERE YOU KNOW IN THE FIRST YERE THE PANDEMIC YOU KNOW SOME BENEFIT THE DOUBT BUT I DO THINK THAT THE IMPORTANT THING THE PRINCIPLE I I CERTAINLY TRY TO FOLLOW BUT WHEN THIY THINK THAT AND YOU WE CAN LL DO BETTER I CAN DO BETTER CERTAINLY TOO BUT I THINK IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE FOR US IN PUBLICOT COMMUNICATION HAS TO BE THETE WERE CLEAR THATE WERE TRANSPARENT ABOUT WHAT WE KNOW AND WHAT WE DON'T KNOW I AND THAT WE EXPLAIN THE WHY TO PEOPLE SO FOR IT TELLING SOME ONE TO DO SOMETHING WHY IS IT BECAUSE THIS LOT A DATED BEHIND IT IS IT BECAUSE IT'S A  SORT OF EXPERT AGREEMENT BEST PRACTICE CASE SOMETIMES AS YOU KNOW AN IN MEDICINE SOMETIMES WHEN WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH DATA TO GUIDE US ONAT THEIRE PEUTIC REPROACH BUT WHEN THE PROBLEM IS IMMINENT THEN SOMETIMES EXPERTS WILL GET TOGETHER AND PUT TOGETHER EXPERT INFORM GUIDELINES TO SAY O CALO BASE ON OUR BEST JUDGMENT AND THE LIMITED DATAT WE HAVE HERE'S WHAT WE RECOMMEND AND AS THE DATA EVOLVES WE WILL CHANGE YOU KNOW AN IN MODIFY THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WE DO THA WITH HIGH PRETENSION RIGHT E EVOLVE AN UP DA RECOMMENDATIONS WE DO THAT WITH LIPIDS IM HERE TOO I THINK THAT HAS TO BE A COULD KEEP PART OF THE APPROACH I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT I SAW MANY PUBLICHEALTH OFFICIALS ENCOUNTER WAS EVEN WHEN THEY WENT OUT WITH COMPREHENSIVE MESSAGES LIKE THAT WHICH ARE HARD TO FIT INTO A SOUND BITE OR TO SIMPLE POSTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA IM OFTEN LOT O THAT WASN'T COVERED WHAT GETS COVERET IS THE TOP LINE YOU KNOW THIS IS WHAT'S BING RECOMMEND AT THAT'S WHAT'S BEING REQUIRED ET CETERA ALL THE EXPLANATION IS LOST ITS MISSING RIGHT AND I THINK WE ALSO ARE LIVING IN A TIME WHERE PEOPLE ARE READING HAD LINES LIKE THEIR LEAVING BUSY LIVES RIGHT THERE NOT NECESSARILY YOU KNOW ALWAYS HEARING ALL OF THE NEW AUNTS YOU KOW THAT'S BEING EXPLAIN IM BUT I THINK THAT THAT'S A CHALLENGE RIGHT IS LIKE  KNOW MANY PUBLIC OFFICIAL STRUGGLED WITH HOW DO YOU DELIVER NEW ANTST INFOR MATION A AT A TIME WHEN THERE ISN'T A CLEAR BLACK AND WHITE ANSWER TO THINGS BUT I THINK THE LAST PIECE AROUND THIS IS A I THINK SOMETHINGI WAS TAUGHTER ARLY IN MEDICAL SCHOOL IS TO APPROACH YOUR PATIENCE WITH HUMILITY RECOGNIZING THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE MORE TRAINING THAN THEY DO AYOU DON'T AREN'T LIVING THEIR LIFE YOU DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH AND YOU SHOULDN'T ASSUME A THINGS ABOUT THEM RAGTIN SO PRORCHING WITH HUMILITY MEANS THAT A YOU'VE GOT A RECOGNIZE THAT NOT EVERYONE CAN BE ABLE TO FOLLOW YOUR GUIDANCE AND IF THEY AREN'T ABLE TO THE DISIMINOU CRITICIZE THEM IT ALSO MEANS RECOGNIZING THAT PEOPLE MAY HAVE IDEAS OR SUGGESTIONS FOR YOU THE MAYASHALLY IMPROVE YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS OR HOW YOU COMMUNICATE AND SO II THESE ARE THE PRINCIPLES I THINK THAT ARE IMPORTANT IN PUBLIC COMMUNICATION BUT I THINK THAT BOTH THE CHALLENGE OF TRANSLATIN NEW ANTS ARGUMENTS INTO WHAT'S ACTUALLY COVERED THAT WAS TOUGH FROM ANY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS I THIN THE OTHER THING HONESTY TUSEN A HUMAN LEVEL THAT BECAME HARD FOR MANY OF THEM AND I AM THINKING PRERTYCLEAR ABOUT LOCAL IN STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS WHO ARE IN THE FRONT LINES THAT I TALK TO A LOT WAS THEY ENDED UP GETTING ATTACKED A LOT AN ABUSE A LOT DURING THE PENDEMIC ANDI DON'T JUST MEAN LIKE ATTACKED ON LINE I MEAN PEOPLE SHOWN UP AT THEIR HOUSES PEOPLE TEHARASSING THEIR CHILDREN A PEOPLE THREATENING THEIR SAFETY AM AND IN THESE WAS OFTEN PEOPLE WHO WERE UPSET ABOUT SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE BEING PUT DOWN FROM LOCAL DEPARTMENTS OF HEALTH AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND LOCOVET WAS A ASTRESSFUL O TIME IS WE'VE SEEN RECENTLY PEOPLE LOST THEIR JOBS PEOPLE WERE LOSING LOVED ONES I MEANG TALK ABOUT DISTRESSFUL TIME BUT I THINK THAT A HUMAN LEVEL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS WHO WERE EXPOSED TO THAT KIND OF ABUSE AND WHO START TO WORRY ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN SAFETY A MANY OF THEM STEPPED OUT OF THE RENAND SAID IS THIS REALLY WORTH IT STO PUT MY FAMILY AT RISK AM AND THAT WAS HARD BECAUSE WE LOST A LOT OF GOOD PUBLIC HEALTH PEOPLE IN THAT RESPECT SO I THINK IN ADDITION TO HAVING SORT OF THESE COORE PRINCIPLES OF PUBLIC HEALTH COMMUNICATION IN PLACE THEY WHAT WE ALSO NEE TO RESTORE ISN'T ENVIRONMENT WERE WE OF FRANKLY OF HUMILITY AND CIVILITY WE DON'T ATTACK PEOPLE YOU KNOW WHO MAYBE HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS OR COMING OUT THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT I'M YOU KNOW ARE NOT PALATABLE OT TO ASKS AND AND I THINK IT'S ALSO INCUMBENT UPON OUR LEADERS IN SOCIETY TO NOT STILK THAT KIND OF RESENTMENT AD AND VIOLENCE AS WELL COS THAT HAPPENED DURING THE PANDAMICUS CLOVE GOT INCREASINGLY POLITICIZED AND YOU KNOW WHAL THAT MAY HAVE BEEN AT TIMES DONE FOR POLITICAL REASONS HERE AND THERE THE PEOPLE WHO SUFFERED WERE BOTH THE PUBLIC HELP LEADERS WERE TRYING DO THE RIGHT THING FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THE PUBLIC THEMSELVES WHO WEREN'T ABLE TO HAVE A CLEAR DIRECT CHANNEL I TO AN A DIALOGUE WITH THEIR PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS I BECAUSE A LOT OF THAT ENDIT UP GETTING CLOSED OFF I FEEL LIK THERE WAS A LOT OF TALKING DOWN TO THE DISSENTERS IN THE GENERAL PUBLIC YE AND I TOLLY AGREE THAT I'M YOU KNON GETTING VIOLENT OR HARASSING PEOPLE WITH WHOM YOU DISAGREE IS IS TOTALLY AN APPROPRIATE IN YO THE ONE THING JUST TO SAY ABOUT THE HUMILITY PIES AND I'LLGIVE MEN EXAMPLE HERE OF WEAR I THINK THIS COULD HAVE N' SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE BETTER ISN'T AN EFFORT FOR EXAMPLE AROUND MASKS I TO RECOMMEND THE PEOPLE WEAR MASKS AND ONE IMPORTANTHING JUS TO KNOW IS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO LIKE SCHOOLS REQUIRING MASKS IE THOSE ARE DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE ON LOCAL LEVELS WYT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOESN'T MANDATE MASKS AND SCHOOLS  DOESN'T THE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT SO THER ARE LOCAL LOCAL DECISIONS BUT THE END OF THE DAY THEY WERE PEOPLE WHO DID NOT WANT THEIR CHILDREN TO WEAR MASKS RIGHT FOR VARIETY OF REASONS SOME WORRIED ABOUT THEIR DEVELOPMENT SOCIAL DEVELOPMENTS SOME WORRIED THAT ITWAS ADDING STRESTS TO THEIR KITSIC PEOPLE HAD MET I DIFFERENT REASONS WHY THEY MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE WANTED THEIR CHILDREN TO WEAR MASKS AND ONE ON TH THINGS I THNK THAT WAS NOT HELPFUL WAS IT WHEN THEY WERE TO COMPARENTS WHO MADE THE DECISION THEY DON'T WANT THEIR KITS TO WEAR MASKS I' I THINK SOME OF THEM RECEIVED A LOT OF CRITICISM WITHOUT PEOPLE NECESSARY STOPPING TO UNDERSTAND WHY THEY MAY HAVE BEEN MAKING THAT DECISION EXALSAY IS A PARENT WHOSE CHILDREN WERE IN SCHOOL IN MY KITS ARE FIVE AND SEVEN AND AIN THE FIRST YEAR THE PANEMIC THEY WERE DOING RESCHOOL VIRTUALLY WHICH WAS A NIGHTMARE IT WAS INCREDIBLY HARD FOR US EVEN WHE THEY GOT BACK TO SCHOOL AND THE FALL OF A TWENTY TWENTY ONE IM IT WAS A REALLY TOUGH LIKE ADJUSTMENT FOR THEM AND I COULD UNDERSTAND LIKE SOME O TH CONCERNS THE PARENTS I WERE HAVING WONDERING ABOUT HEY HOW ARE THESE PRECAUTIONS AFFECTING MY CHILD'S EXPERIENCE AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT SO ON THE WHOLE THIS RECOMMENDATION MAY STILL BE I HEY IMPROVE VENTILATION YOUR CLASS ROOMS RECOMMEND MASKING RECOMMENTESTING ET CETERA BUT THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS I THINK HAVE TO BE MADE IN A WAY THAT ACKNOWLEDGES LIKE THE HUMANITY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE MAY HAVE A DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW OR MAY MAKE A DIFFERENT DECISION A FOR THEIR CHILD AND I KNOW THAT WHEN LOCAL LOCALITIES MADE THE DECISION IN MANY CASES TO REQUIRE A SCHOOLS IN THEIR INO KITS IN THEIR DISTRICT TO WEAR AMASK THAT PUT SOME PARENTS WHO DIDN'T WANT THAT I PUT THEM IN O HART PLACE RIGHT AND BUT I THINK THAT ARE A FAILURE TO ACTUALLY HAVE AN OPEN HONEST RESPECTFUL CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS WERE WE DIDN'T FEEL LIKE WE WERE I EACH BEING A TACKED YOU KNOW AS PARENTS FOR OUR DECISIONS OR AS COMMUNY MEMBERS FOR THE DECISIONS WE WERE MAKING I THINK THAT NOT ONLY HINDERED I THINK THE RESPONSE BUT I THINK IT ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTED TO THIS DIVISION THE SENSE OF BLACK AND WHITENESS THAT HETES  US AGAINST THEM AND THEN SUDDENLY IF I WAS AGAINST ONE MEASURE THAT I WAS AGAINST ALL OF THEM YOU KNOW IF I WAS FOR ONE MEASURERS FOR ALL OF THEM BECAUSE WE JUST TARTED SEGREGATING INTO SIDES I AND TIS BECAME APOLARIZED YOUN EXPERIENCE AT A TIME WHERE REALLY IT SHOULD AVE BEEN A CRISIS THAT BROUGHT US TOGETHER AS MESSEAS IT WAS AAND THAT HONESTLY ANDREW IS WHAT I WORRY ABOUT MOST FOR THE NEXT PANDEMIC I LIKE I THINK WE'VE LEARNED A LOT FROM THIS PANDEMIC ABOUT A HOW TO MANUFACTURE VAXENES AND  N  HAD A DEVELOPED THEM QUICKLY I HAD A DISTRIBUTE THEM  EFFICIENTLY IIN WE HAD ON I WONET WS ONE OF THE THING MOST HISTORIC AND AN EFFECTIVE ACTING DISTRIBUTION EFFORTS IN THIS COUNTRY EVEN THOUGH ICERTAINLY COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER BUT IT WAS HISTORIC BY BY ALL MEASURES WE'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT HOW TO DO VAXINES THEIR PUTICS A LOT OF THE NUTS AND BOLTS O A A PANDEMIC RESPONSE WELL BUT I WORRY WHAT WE ARE STILL STRUGGLING WITH IS HW WE BUILD TRUST HOW WE COMMUNICATE WITH THE PUBLIC AND HOW WE STAY TOGETHER AS A COUNTRY IN THE FACE OF ADVERSITY CAUSE IF ORGAN IF WE'RE DIVIDED THE WAY WE WERE DURING COVID DURING THE NEXT PANDAMIC OR THE THE NEXT I YOU KNOW FOR I A THROUGHT THAT MAY COME FROM FOR AN ADVERSARY THAT'S A HUGE NATIOAL SECURITY ISSUE FOR US AND SO THAT THAT'S WHAT KEEPS ME UP AT NIGHT WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE NEXT PEN THAT MAKE THAT MAY COME TWO QUESTIONS RELATE TO WHAT YOU JUST SAID FIRST OF ALL AM AS IT RELATES TO VAXINES IN MY OPINION IM AND I THINK THE OPINION OF MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT THE RESPONSE TO THE NEXT PENDEMIC AM WILL BE HEAVILY CONTINGENT ON AT LEAST SOME SORT OF ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO AT LEAST FEEL THAT THERE'VE BEEN VAXING INJURIES RIGHT TO SIMPLY SAY AM OCCADE THE PREVIOUS TAT ROUND WITH COVID WENT THIS WAY AND NOW THERE'S NOW VIROUS AXTS RIGHT LET'S HOPE NOT AND GOD FORBID BUT SOUNDS I GETS COMING AT SOME POINT AND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO THINK TO THE LAST TIME AND THEY'RE GOING TO IMMEDIATELY SAY WELL THE LAST TIME WE WERE TOLD TO YOU KNOW I TAKE OF AXINE SOME PEOPLE HAD A GOOD EXPERIENCE WITH THAT OTHER PEOPLE DIDN'T AND IT IN THIS EMPATHY MODEL OF ACKNOWLEDGING AND OUKNOTE LETTING YOUR MORAL COMPASS GUIDE AN UNDERSTANDING THE WHY BEHIND WHAT PEOPLE ARE AR ARE DOING AND HOW THE REACTING IT SEEMS TO ME THAT NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO AT LEAST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THEIR COMING FROM EVEN IF ONE DISAGR REES MAYBE EVEN ESPECIALLY IF ONE DISAGREEMS AND TRY AND GET PEOPLE ALINED NOW BEFORE THE NEXT PANDEMIC IT AND I'M SO WHAT EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE IF ANY TO TRY AND ACKNOWLEDGE I'M THAT SOME PEOPLE REALLY DO FEEL AS IF THEY WERE HARMED I'M NOT SAYING IFTHEY WERE NOT BUT CLEARLY THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO FEEL THAT THEY WHERE PEOPLE THEY KNOW WERE HARMED IS THERE AN EFFORT TO PRESENT THEM WITH DATA TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM TO TRY AND GET PEOPLE ALINE SO THAT THE NEXT TIME AROUND OW WE CAN BE MORE OF A UNIFIED FRON WHATEVER THE EECESSARY RESPONSE HAPPENS TO BE YET NOW IS THE REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION AND AND TO ME I ALWAYS GO BACK TO SUT FIRST PRINCIPLES FROM PRACTISING MEDICINE RIT WHICH ISE IF THERE IS A MEDICINE YOU GIVE A PATIENT AND EVEN IF IT HELPS NINE IN AP WHEN NIN IM PERCENTIPATIENTS BUT THIS ONE PARTICUL THE PATIEN TO HAPPEN TO BE HARMED  BY IT YOU GO IN YOU ACKNOWLEDGMENT YOU TALK ABOUT IT AND YOU TOGETHER TROT OUT A PATH FOR HOW YOU WANT TO MOVE FORWARD AND THETHE PATHFOR MIGHT BE YES LET'S GET RID OF THAT MEDICATION BUT LET' SEASON ALTERNATIVE LET'S TRY IT OR WE CAN'T USE THAT MEDICATION ANY MORE HERE THE RISKS YOU MAY SUSTAIN BUT WILL FIND OTHER WAYS TO PROTECT YOU RIGHT SO THAT'S WHAT WE WOULD DO IN MEDICINE WRIGHT THAT'S WHAT I'VE DONE WITH PATIENTS OVER THE YEARS I THINK HERE TOO SIMILARLY WHEN THN WHEN IT COMES TO TRACKING ADVERSE EVENTS FROM VAXENES THIS IS AN AIR WHERE THE SEDY SEEN THE F T TRACK AND COLLABORATE AND TRACKING MEANS NOT JUST NOT ONLY COLLECTING REPORTS FROM THE PUBLIC AND FROM CLINATIONS WHEN THEY SEE AN EFFECT THAT MAY BE RELATED TO A VAXENE BUT IT ALSO INVELVES ANALYZING THOSE TO SEE WER THEY QUARRELATER TOR WHERE THER'S ACTUAL CAUSATION THERE RIGHT BECAUSE I'M YOU KNOW IF I F TO DAY FOR EXAMPLE I FELT UNWELL AN I TRACE BACK WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY IN IT TURNS OUT HEY I ATE THIS BERIDO THAT WAS OUT IN THE THE SUN FOR WAI TOO LONG THE QUESTION IS AM I FEELING SICK BECAUSE THE BRIDO OR DID THE BREEDER JUST HAPPEN TO BE YOU KNOW A YOUSOMETHING TO HAP THAN MET IT'S INDEPENDENT OF HOW I'M FEELING IMAYBE TURNS OUT SOMEBODY WAS ACTUALLY SICK WITH A G I BUG YOU KNOW AROUND ME AND THAT'S THE REASON THAT I'M IN THE WAY I AM TO DAY SO ANALYSIS THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE ON CASES THAT A REPORTED IS IMPORTANT AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE SEEDY SEEM THE AFTIA DO TOGETHER NOW THAT ANALYSIS I THINK IS ESENTIAL TO COMMUNICATE CLEARLY TO THE PUBLIC IM AND WHENEVER I ENGAGE WITH FOLKS IN THE PUBLIC WHICH WE DO OFTEN AND PEOPLE WILL TALK TO ME ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES WITH VACT SCENES I DO THENSE IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT PEOPLE HAVE GONE THROUGH IMLIKE SOME PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE LIKE WHEN I GOT A VACETED FOR COVE OR EXAMPLE I I FELT LIKE I HAD MYLD FLUE LIKE SYMPTOMS FOR A COUPLEO DAYS YOU KNOW IT WASN'T GREAT I WOULDN'TE PREFERT I DIDN'TYOU KNOW HAVE THOSE FEELINGS LIKE YOU KNOW AND THAN I FELT BETTER COUPLEOF DAYS LATER AND THEN I MOVED ON BUT YOU KNOW I ACKNOWLEDGE IT DIDN'T FEEL GOOD YOU KNOW TO TO FEEL THAT WAY THERE AROTHER PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE HAD EXPERIENCES WHETE THEY FELT THAT THEY HA MORE SERIOUS YOU KNOW ISIDE OF FACTS AND THERE MAYBE QUESTION WAS THAT RELATED TO THE VACT SCENE OR NOT SO I THINK WE HAVE TO BOT HERE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THOSE N I CERTAINLY TRY TO DO THAT I KNOW I TH PROBALY THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP DOING THAT A CROSS ALL OF GOVERNMENT BUT I ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO TO HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS THAT WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER THOSE ARE RELATED OR NOT IF YOU GO ON LINE AND THE CD SES A SIGHT THAT WHERE THEY COLLECT A LOT OF THIS INFORMATION AND YOU JUST PURELY LOOK AT REPORTS THAT ARE GIVEN OF POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS THAT YOU CAN'T SORT OF TAKE THAT AND SAY AH THOSE ARE ALL RELATED TO THE VAC SCENE LOOK AT THIS RATE OF HARM IT'S EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH BECAUSE WE DON'T ACTUALLY DO THAT WITH ANY OTHER VACENIOR MEDICINE I SURE WE E START THERE WE DO THE ANALYSIS AND WE TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S ACTUALLY RELATED OR NOT SO I THINK THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE'VE GOT A DO HERE TOO ONE LAST THING ITI'LL SAYS THAT IT'S IMPORTANT I THINK ALSO FOR US TO TO HELP PUT THIS IN CONTECT OF OTHER VACSENES AND MEDICINES AND INTERVENTIONS THAT WE USE SO FOR EXAMPLE JUST TAKE TYLENAL FOR EXAMPLE LIKE MOST PEOPLE THINK GO WELL TILEN ALL IT'S SAFE THERE'S NOTHING BAD HAPPENS IF IT TAKE TALEL ET CETERA BUT PEOPLE WHO TRACK THE DATA KNOW THAT TILEN ALL BUY ENLARGE IS A GENERALLY SPEAKING A SAFE MEDICATION BUT THERE ARE PEOPLEWHO EXPERIENCE ADVERSE EFFECTS FROM TILE IN ALL LIVER DAMAGE YOU KNOW  AND OTHER A ADVERSE EFFECTS AND YOU KNOW THAT DATA IS AVAILABLE BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE CASE OF THAT MEDICATION IS THAT THE RISKS AND BENEFITS ARE BOAST ANALYZE AND THEN A RECOMMENDATION IS PUT FORWARD ABOUT A GENERALLY SAFEWAY TO USE IT AND THEN THERE'S DATA PUT OUT ABOUT THE THE SUSIDE EFFECTS COMMON OR RARE RIGHT BUT I THINK SOMETIMES WE ALSO FORGET THAT A LOT OF THE MEDICINES THAT WE HAVE COME TO TAKE AND JUST SEE IS NORMAL PART OF OUR LIFE JUST LIKE ANY OTHER OF AXENE THAT THERE IS SOME A RATE OF RERSIDE EFFECTS THAT WILL HAPPEN I SAY THAT BECAUSE WHAT I WORRY ABOUT IN THE BLACK AND WHITE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE'RE LIVING AND IS SOMETIMES PEOPLE WILL TAKE AN ANECDOTE ABOUT A POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECT AND WILL PORTRAY THAT IS THE RULE RIN IWILL SAY WELL LOOK I KNOW SOMEBODY WHO HAD THIS SIDE EFFECT SO NOBODY SHOULD TAKE THIS CAUS IS IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO YOU IF WE DID THAT NOBODY WOULD EVER TAKE TILE IN LL NO ONEWOULD EVER TAKE I BEPROPHEN NO ONE WOULD TAKE NIQUEL LIKE NO ONE WOULD TAKE ANY OTHE COMMON MEDICATIONS THAT WE PICK UP AT THEIR DRUG STORE AND THAT WE COMMONLY USE SO THAT'S HOW I THINK WE HAVE TO APPROACH US WITH A COMMINATION OF A CLEAR COMMUNICATION APATHIC LISTENING AND AND DATA AND CONTECTS AM AGAIN THAT DOESN'T FIT NEATLY IN IT IN A AN A SOCIAL MEDIA POST PER SAY BUT I THINK PART OF WHAT WERE WE NEED TO DO IS A COUNTRY IS REBUILD THE RELATIONSHIP ONUSTLY BETWEEN THE MEDICAL PUBLIC HELTH ESTABLISHMENT AND THE PUBLIC AND I THINK ITS SORTS WITH THIS KIND OF COMMUNICATION THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD ABOUT THE NEXT PANDEMIC AND THE ONE WE JUST HAD IS A WHY NOT HAVE COMMITTEES OF PEOPLE OF DIVERSE BACKGROUND SOCIA ECONOMIC DIVERSITY RACIAL DIVERSITY EVERY ASPECT OF DIVERSITY RATHER THAN INDIVIDUAL STANDING THERE TELLING US WHAT TO DO FOR SEVERAL REASONS ONE AS AM WE ARE COUNTRY OF MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE I THINK WEA THERE ARE DOZENS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF SCIENTIFIC PAPERS SHOWING THAT PATIENTS FOLLOW THE ADVICE OF DOCTORS THAT LOOK LIKE THEM AND SOUND LIKE THEM OR TO WHOM THEY WOULD ASPIRE TO BE LIKE WE KNOW THIS AND YET PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS TYPICALLY ARE UNITARY ONE PERSON TELLING US DO THIS DON'T DO THAT THIS IS A GOOD IDEA THAT'S A BAD IDEA I' BUT ONE CITIZEN BUT I'M PUTTING UP BOTH HANDS BOTH WE IN ALL TOES AND SAYING COMMITTEES SMALL BUT DIVERSE COMMITTEES THAT PEOPLE CAN RELATE TO AND FEEL AS IF UM THE MESSAGES THAT THEY'RE GETTING ARE VETTED THROUGH A COMMON UNDERSTANDING YES IT'S REALLY GOD SUGGESTION AND AND I COULDN'T AGRE WITH YOU MORE THAT A DIVERSITY OF VOICEIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO TO GET A MESSAGE OUT AND DURING COVENASHY THAT'S ONE OF THE THING IS THAT OUR OFFICE SECTO WAS ALWAYS HELPING TO BUILD WAS SOMETHING CALLED THE COMMUNITY COR I WERE WE ACTUALLY WE RECOGNIZE IS A VERY CLEARLY NESS TO SOMETHING I YON I CAME TO SEE AS A DOCTOR SOMETIMES I WAS A RIGHT PERSON A MESSAGE TO PATIENT SOMETIMES I WASN'T I SOMETIMES IT WAS THE NURSE SOMETIMES IT WAS THE MEDICAL STUDENTS SOMETIMES IT WAS AN ADMINISTRATOR OR THE THE SOCIAL WORK OR WA DIFFERENT BACKGROUND DIFFERENT LIFE EXPERIENCES SO PART OF THIS WORK IS NOING WOING TO STEP UP WHEN TO STEP BACK I BUT THE COMMUNITICOURE THAT WE WERE BUILDING WAS AE REALLY DIVERSE YOA GROUP OF PEOPLE AAND LOT OF HAD PUBLIC HELP BACKGROUNDS BUT A LOGT OF MORE COMMUNITY LEADERS WHO UNDERSTOOD HEALTH EVENTHOUGH THY DID'T HAVE FORMAL TRAINING A BUT THEY PEOPLE WHO KNEW THEIR COMMUNITIES IAND THEY HAD THE TRUST OF THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THEY UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS GOING ON THEY WANTED TO BE HELPFUL SO WE BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER TO SAY OK LOOK HERE'S WHAT THE SCIENCE IS TELLING US HERE THE GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS A HERE'SWL WE WOULD PROVIDE YOU ASK US ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE LIKE SOMETHIN WE DON'T KNOW WILL GO BACK AND LOOK IT UP A BUT YOU'RE THE LEADERS IN YOUR COMMUNITY THEY SHOULD BE HEARING FROM YOU YOU KNOW ABOUT ABOUT THESE MESSAGES AND T N THAT THOSE FOLKS WENT OUT AND ACTUALLY WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THEM COLLABORATED WITH THEM THEY WOULD DESIGN THE MESSAGES FOR THEIR COMMUNITY BASE ON WHAT THEY THOUGHT MADE SENSE AND WERE'T TAKEN WHAT WE SAID WORD FOR WORD WE DON'T WANT THEM TO IBUT TO ME LIKE THAT KIND OF DIVERS APPROACHES WHAT WE NEED MORE NOW YOU'LL SEE WHAT WOULD I WOULD HAVE LIKED I WOULD HAVE LIKED IF MORE MEDIA NET WORKS PUT THOSE FOLKS ON TEV AND GOT THEM ON THE RADIO RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT MANY OF THEM WERE SHOWING UP IN TEIR COMMUNITIES WERE KNOCKING ON DOORS WERE I DOING LOCAL YOU KNOW PODCASTS ET CETERA AND THAT WAS GREAT BUT I WOULD HAVE LIKED MORE OF THEIR FACES I CARRIED ON TEVY RIGHT SO THAT'S A PLACE WHERE WHEN WE TALK TO MEDIA AND MY TOCT FOLKS INMEDIAA ONE OF THINGS I ENCOURAGE THEM AND PUSHHIM TO DO ALSO S TO SAY LOOK IF YOU CAN TAKE MORE OF THESE DIVERSE FACES AND VOICES AND PUT THEM OUT THEIR THAT'S USHE GOOD FOR THE COMMUNITY AND ALSO HLPS PEOPLE SEE THAT IT'S NOT LIKE ONE OR TWO PEOPLE WERE A SORT OF PUSH IN A GENDE HERE THIS IS A THE PUBLIC HELE COMMUNITIES BIG IT'S BROAD IT'S DIVERSE AT AS LOT OF VOICES AND AND S THE MORE VOICES WE CAN HEAR FROM AS PUBLIC THIN THE BETTER OFF WE ARE  HEAR HER I I YOU KNOW AGAIN I  GENUINELY HOPE IN PRAY THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANOTHER PENDAMIC BUT IF IN WHEN WE DO I HOPE THERE WILL BE COMMITTEES RATHER THAN INDIVIDUALS I KNOW WE YOU KNOW THIS IS A THING IN THIS COUNTRY WE LIKE THE IDEA THAT ONE PERSONS CAN A SAVE THE CLIMATE ONE PERSONS CAN A SAVE TRANSPORTATION ONE PERSON THE OTHER COVERS THE PERSON OF THE YEAR TYPE APPROACH D IM BUT WE BUT THEN WE GET FRUSTRATED WHEN THAT PERSON DOES THINGS OR MAKES DECISIONS THAT WE DON'T LIKE IN THEIR PUBLICER PERSONAL LIFE AND THEN IT ALL SEEMS TO FALL INTO DIVISION AND I JUST FEEL LIKE NOT TALKING ABOUT GROUPS OF HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE AT SMALL GROUPS SO I THINK WE'RE LINED IN THAT WAY YLOOK THERE THERE'S THE THING IN A NOTION THAT EM I THINK SOME HAS WE DO WANT LIKE THE ONE PERSON WHO CAN NOT ONLY NECESSARILY HAVE ALL OUR TRUSTS AND WE CAN LOOK TO BUT ALSO WHO WE CAN HOLD ACCOUNTABLE YOU KNOW SOMETHING I DOESN'T QUITE WORK OUT OF WE DON'T LIKE SOMETHING AND AND WHELL I GET THAT SERT OF MENTALITY I THINK THAT IN THIS MOMENT ESPECIAL WRETIN A REBUILD TRUST I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO KNOW THE WHAT THEY MAY BE HEARING IN TERMS OF MEDICAL ORSI A PUBLIC COUTH RECOMMENDATIONS IT'S ONE FOR THEM TO KNOW HOW BROAD AN AUDIENCE THAT'S COMING FROM OR BROAD A GROUP OF EXPERTS RIGHT AND WE THERE WAS A LOT MORE BROAD AGREEMENT FOR EXAMPLE DURING COVED AND I DURING YOU BOLA DURING ZECA ON PUBLIC HEALTH RECOMMENDATIONS BUT YOU WOULDN' ALWAYS KNOW IT IF YOU TURN ON THE DEVY AS YOU WORSEING A THE SAME  COUPLE OF FACES SO I THINK WE HAVE TO TO CERTAINLY DIVERSIFY THAT OM ONE OTHER THING I THAIN I'LL TELL YOU THIT'S IMPORTANT HERE IS I THINK WE HAVE TO ALSO THINK ABOUT HOW WE FUND GROUPS ON THE GROUND THAT ARE DOING THE THE HARD WORK OF GETTING PUBLIC HEATH MESSAGES OUT BECAUSE ONE OF THINGS THAT THOSE GROUPS OFTEN WOULD TELL ME ND THESE ARE  MIGT SA GROUPS I'M OM TALKG ABOUT THE COMMUDY ORGANIZATION THAT SPENT YEARS IN A NEIGHBOURHOOD GETTING TO KNOW FAMILIES WHERE FOLKS RECOGNIZE THEM WHEN THEY'RE WALKING DOWN THE STREET THEY' GO YET THAT'S A PERSONAL ORGANIZATION ACTS THEY UNDERSTAND AS THEY GET US THEYRE LOOKING OUT FOR US LOT OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS HAD SPENT THEIR RESOURCES HELPING THE COMMUNITY GETTING TO KNOW THE COMMUNITY BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE SOPHISTICATED MECHANISMS TO APPLY FOR GRANTS FOR EXAMPLE THEY DIDN'T HAVE GRANT RIDERS WHO HAD DONE THIS A THOUSAND TIMES SO HISTORICALLY THOSE GROUPS HAVE A HARD TIME GETTING SUPPORTANT FUNDING SO I'LL TAY ONE IS ITO THING MY MY WIFE DID WHICH I CERTAINLY WAS VERY PROUD OF IS SHE WAS HELPING TO TO BUILD AN EFFORT AND TO BUILD AN AN ONPROFIT ORGANIZATION WITH A COUPLE OF COLLEAGUES THAT AE ORGANIZATION OF PEOPLE WHO KNEW HOW TO GET MONEY HOW TO APPLY FOR GRANTS HOW TO GET FOUNDATION SUPPORT BUT WHO ALSO HAD THE WISDOM TO KNOW THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THEY COULD DO WAS TO GIVE PORTIONS OF THAT MONEY TO GROUPS ON THE GROUND SO THEY SAW THEMSELVES AS AN ORGANIATION THAT CHANNELED MONEY TO GROUPS THAT HAD TRUST AND THEY EXECUTED THEIR THEIR THEI'R MISSION THAT WAY AND THAT WAS VERY EFFECTIVE AND I THINK WE NEED MORE OF THAT WHEN IT COMES TO DISSEMINATING FINDING ONE THING ETTING MANY PEOPLE MAY NOT I MAY R MAY NOT APPRECIATE IS THAT WHEN YOU IT'S ACTUALLY HARD FROM GOVERNMENT TO PUT OUT A LOT OF MONEY I AT ONCE AND TO DO SO QUICKLY RIGHT IWHEN YO'VE GOT A LOT OF FUNDS TAT YOU NEED TO GET INTO COMMUNITIES WHAT HAPPENS AS A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OUTHOR WILL GIVE IT TO STATES STATES WILL THEN GIVE IT TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES I TO LIKE THE LOCAL DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH BY APRAT POTENTIALLY AND THEN THEY WILL LOOK TO DISTRIBUTE IT T OTHERS THAT TAKES TIME BUT IT ALSO MEANS IF YOU'RE NOT CONNECTED TO THAT NETWORK IF YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR LOCAL DEPARTMENT O HELTH OR YOU'RE NOT CONNECTED THE STATE DEPARTMENT HELTH SOMETIMES IT CAN BE CHALLENGING TO FIGGURE OUT HOW TO GET THE MONEY AND SO I THINK WE NEED MORE OPERATIONS LIKE YOU KNOW I WH MY WIFE AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN BUILDING TO TRY TO GET THOSE FUNDS DIRECTLY TO THE FOLKS WHO NOT YOU DON'T ESTALY HAVE THE MOST FANCYIN OF GRANT WRITING OPERATION BUT THEY HAVE THE RELATIONSHIPS CAUSE F THE END OF THE DAY IT'S THOSE RELATIONSHIPS THAT CREATE THE TRUST IT'S A TRUST THAT ALLOWS INFOR LIFE SAVING INFORMATION TO GET TO PEOPLE AND THAT'S THE LINGTH IT'S MISSING INTERESTING FARMER BIG FARMR I GOT A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER NOT BIG FARME IS ON THE TAKE FOR EVERY PUBLIC HEALTH INNITIATIVE NOW AS ASOMEBODY WHO UNDERSTANDS A BIT ABOUT AND CERTAINLY BELIEVES IN THE USE OF CERTAIN PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS I FIND MOST IM QUESTIONS ABOUT QUOTINCL BIG FARMER TOS OVERLOOK THE FACT THAT THERE ARE THOUSANDS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF EDICATIONS THAT SAVE LIVES AND ENRICH PEOPLE'S LIVES THAT AR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS II'LSO BELIEVE MY AUDIENCE KNOWS I SAY IT OVER NOVERAGAIN THAT BETTER LIVING THROUGH CHEMISTRY STILL REQUIRES BETTER LIVING WE STILL HAVE TO GET OUR SUNLIGHT GET OUR SLEEP SOCIAL CONNECTION GOOD NUTRITION EXERCISE AN ALL THOSE THINGS THERE'S JUST NO PILL THAT'S GOING TO REPLACE THOSE BUT I THINK IT'S A VALID QUESTION THAT PEOPLE ARE ASKING IS THERE A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BIG FARMER AND PUBLIC HEALTH INITIATIVES IN A WAY THAT SHOULD HAVE US CONCERNED ABOUT THE MESSAGING THAT WERE GETTING AND HAT TIMES AND THE FACT THAT THE UNITED STATES CONSUMES THE VAST MAJORITY OF DRUGS FOR MENTAL HEALTH FOR INSTANCE AS COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTRIES SO THAT'S ONE QUESTION AND THEN UM I WANT A DOVE TAIL INTO THAT QUESTION WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S A HISTORY OF 'STHE TOBACCO INDUSTRY BEING YOU KNOW A VERY INTERDIGITATED SHALL WE SAY WITH UM GOVERNMENT POLICIES IN WAYS THAT HAD US BASICALLY INJURE IF NOT KILL MILLIONS OF AMERICANS AND THEN EVENTUALLY SAY YOU CAN'T SMOKE ON YOUR HOSPITAL YOU CAN'T SMOKE ANYWHERE THERE'S AVERY FEW PLACES WHERE YOU CAN  CONSUME TOBACCO PRODUCTS YOU KNOW THAT THAT KIND OF UM RELATIONSHIP AND FINANCIAL INCENTIVES AND THEN A LOT OF BACK PEDDLING LATER UM I THINK WERE ON PEOPLES EM TRUST SO HOW SHOULD WE FRAME THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FARMAR SUITABLE INDUSTRY GOVERNMENT AN PUBLIC HEALTH INITIATIVES IN A WAY THAT IS OU KNOW AT LEAST HALF WAY FUNCTIONAL EIT LOOK I UNDERSTAND WHERE THE CONCERN IN SUSPICION COMES FROM RIGHT AND LOOK I I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT PUBLIC HEALTH INITIATIVES AND MEDICAL ADVICE IS INDEPENDENT OF THE INFLUENCE OF INDUSTRIES I MAY SEEK TO PROFIT FROM WHAT'S BEING RECOMMENDED OR FROM MEDICATIONS ARE BEING PRESCRIBED AND WE LOOK WE HAVE A HISTORY IN MEDICINE RIGHT OF DOCTORS WHO WERE YOU GIVEN GIFTS AND VACATIONS AND ALL KINDS OF FANCY THINGS BY FARMACCOMPANIES AND AN EFFORT TO INFLUENCE WHAT THEY PRESCRIBED THOT WAS REALLY PROBLEMATIC AND NOW WE'RE SEEN A LOT LESS OF THAT WHICH IS GOOD LOT OF RULES HADE BEEN PUT IN PLACED BY MEDICAL SOCIETIES AND PROFESSIONAL SOCIETIES AND BY ACANOMIC INSTITUTIONS TO SAY THIS IS AN UNACCEPTABLE WAY TO PRACTICE AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT CAUSE I DO THINK THAT HUMAN PSYCHOLOGY IS THAT SOMETIMES WE UNDER ESTIMATE HOW MUCH WERE INFLUENCED BY INCENTIVES WE THINK A YE I'M GETTING THAT BUT I KNOW OW TO MAKE INDEPENDENT DECISIONS BUT AN ENITY WER R HUMAN AND WHEN WERE INFLUENCE WORDS A GREAT DRUG IT COULD BE WHILE THIS IS HE DRUG IS RALLY HELPING MY PATIENCE UNHAPPY TO RECOMMEND IT TO THEM YET SO THATHIS IT WAS SORT OF I WANT US EVERY ONE THEY THOUGH LIKE TAKING MONEY FROM A FARM A COMPANIES AS A PHYSICIAN I THINK IT'S HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC RIGHT I THINK IT'S HARD TO SAY THAT IT DOESN'T INFLUENCE PRACTICE MAY BE DOESN'T FOR SOME PEOPLE BUT IT IT'S REALLY HARD TO KNOW WHO THIS PEOPLE ARE A I DO THINK THAT SEPARATE FROM THAT YOU CAN BE A PHYSICIAN WHO PRESCRIBES MEDICATIONS AS YOU BELIEVE THEY WORK LOOK AS A DOCTOR I HAVE PRESCRIBED MANY ANTABIATICS DURING CASES OF INFECTION THAT HAVE HELPED MY PATIENCE AND I WOULD PRESCRIBE THOSE AGAIN I AM GLAD THAT THOSE EXIST A IN MANY CASES THEYVE SAVE THE LIVES IU A PATIENCS HAS CARING FOR IN THE HOSPITAL SO THAT'S WHAT WICH SHOULD DRIVE US I IS IS DOES THE DATA SHOW THAT THEY WORK AND DOES OUR PATIENT NEED THEM RIGHT THAT'S WHAT SHOULD DRIVE ER DECISIONS WHEN IT COMES A PUBLIC HELL TOE RECOMMENDATIONS HERE TO I THING A SIMILAR PRINCIPLE HOLDS WHICH IS THAT I DON'T THINK THAT FARM A MONEY I SHOULD BE INFLUENCING OUR PUBLIC HELT DECISIONS WHICH MEANS THAT IT SHOULDN'T BE FUNDING OUR PUBLIC HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS A CERTAINLY IL LA YU THAT THIS IS OBVIOUS TO YOU BUT I'LL SAY JUST TO BE CLEAR FOR EVERONE WHO'S LISTENING LIKE OUR OFFICE A DOESN'T TAKE ANY MONEY FROM INDUSTRY NOT JUST FARM INDUTRY FOR MANY INDUSTRY LIKE OUR  THE MONEY THAT WE GET IS ALLICATED BY CONGRESS AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S TACKSPAY OUR MONEY AND THAT'S ALL WE GET AND AND THAT'S IMPORTANT WE DON'T WANT MONEY FROM THE FROM YOU KNOW FROM  FARMASUITABLE COMPANIES AM BUT THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW THAT THESE DECISIONS ARE NOT BEING MADE FOR FOR FINANCIAL GAIN AMWLTHAT'S I BE BEING SAID I THERE'S A BROADER CONCERN I HAVE ANDREW WHICH IS I THINK THAT WE HAVE BECOME A PAIL FOR EVERY PROBLEM SOCIETY WELL WE LOOK FOR A QUICK FIX OF A MEDICINE FOR EVERY CHALLENGE A THAT WE MAY INCUR AND SOME TIME S YES I'M I'M A BELIEVER THAT IF SCIENCE OU NOW HELPS US CREATE A MEDICATIONS THIT CAN HEALP SOLVE DISEASE WE SHOULD USE THEM APPROPRIATELY BUT I THINK WE DISCOUNT HEAVILY THE BEHAVIOURAL CHANGES THAT WE NEED TO MAKE THE MORE BROADER SUSCIDAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES THAT WE NEED TO MAKE THAT INFLUENCE OUR HEALTH LIKE OUR FOOD ENVIRONMENT MATTERS FOR OUR HEALTH OUR DECISIONS ABOUT HOW PHYSICALLY ACTIVE WE ARE MATTER FOR OUR HEALTH WHETHER NOT WE SLEEP MATTERS FOR OUR HEALTH AND ALL OF THESE IMPACT OUR MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL BEING AS WELTH AND SO I I WHEN WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE THAT BY US THAT THAT TO ME IS NOT ALWAYS YOU KNOW STEMMING FROM MONEY THAT CAME FROM A FARMER SUITABLE COMPANY ALTHOUGH I THINK IT THE ADDS THAT WE SEE ALL THE TIME FROM FARM A COMPANIES I THING TRY TO CONVINCE US THAT HAY JUST TAKE THIS PILL ONCE A DAY AND ALL YOUR PROBS ILL GO AWAY BUT I THINK IT'S MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT AND AND I THINK THAT EVEN FOR YOU IN TO HEALTH CARE SETTING  IF YOU ARE IF YOU'RE SEEING A PATIENT WHO HAS PAIN WHOSE HAVING INTENSE PAIN IF FEELS EASIER SOMETIMES TO PROSCRIBE A MEDICATION FOR THAT PAIN RATHER THAN TRYING TO TO DEAL WITH NON MEDICATISHIAN BASED YOU KNOW APPROACHERS ORE TRY TO GET THE DEEPER ORIGINS OF THE PAIN I'M NOT SAYING THAT'S WHAT DOCTORS DO ALL THE TIME BUT I'M SAYING THAT WE'RE LIVING IN AN ENVIRONMENT AN A BROADER CULTURE WERE WE I THINK INCREASINGLY REACH FOR SOMETHING THAT WE SEE IS A QUICK IMMEDIATE FIX AND I GAN DON'T BLAME PEOPLE FOR THAT WE RATHER TAKE A QUICK FIX OVER SOME MITS CAN TO TAKE A LONG TIME BUT I THINK IT IS SELLING US I THINK SOMETIMES A FALSE HOPE WHICH IS THAT THAT'S LL WE NEED TO SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS AND IN THE A LOT OF TIMES YOU NEED MORE YOU NEED THE BEHAVIOUR OL CHANGES INED THE ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES I'M THAT'S ONE OF MY BIG CONCERNS IN TERMS OF HOW WE COMMUNICATE ABOUT HEALTH WOULD A POTENTIAL SOLUTION BE THIS IDEA OF SMALL COMMITTEES SO LET'S SAY SOMEBODYIS EXPERIENCING CHRONIC PAIN LOCALIZED OR GENERAL THAT THEY WOULD GO TO THEIR G ERAL PRACTITIONER BUT IN THE ROOM WOULD ALSO BE SOMEBODY WHO UNDERSTANDS SEMATIC MEDICINE A A SIHE TRAIN CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGISTS WHO UNDERSTAND SOMEATTICS THAT THE BODY IN THE BRAIN ARE LINKED THROUGH THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AM AND COULD ALSO ASSESS A YOU KNOW POSSIBLE PSYCHOLOGICAL ROUTES OF THE ISSUE AND THEN SOMEBODY IN THE ROOM WHO CAN MAKE A BEHAVIORAL NUTRITIONAL AM EVEN SUPPLEMENTATION BASED SAFE SUPPLEMENTATION BASE RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEN THE PHYSICIAN WHOU CAN SAY YOU KNOW IN IN ADDITION TO THAT I THINK THE PERSON SHOULD HAVE ON HAND YOU KNOT A FIVE MILIGRAM DOSAGE OF A PRESCRIPTION DRUG THAT IF THEY NEED IT THEY COULD TAKE AND I THINK IT WOULD PROVIDE A LOT OF PROTECTIONS AGAINST YOU KNOW A POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS OF ANY ONE OF THOSE THINGS IN ISOLATION A THER GREAT PROTECTIONS IN HAVING PEOPLE MEET IN GROUPS A FOR LOTS OF REASONS AND THE PERSON WOULD FEEL VERY WELL CARED FOR  SO AGAIN SMALL COMMITTEES OF PEOPLE WOUTH DIVERSE EXPERTEECE POOLING TOGETHER TO TREAT PEOPLE FROM A FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD MORE HOLISTIC PERSPECTIVE WHY NOT I'M YUR DISPIBING THE DREAM I DAIN'T EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAMS THAT CAN PROVIDE IN O GRATIVE CARE RECOGNIZING THAT IN THIS STAIN AGE THERES NOT ONE PERSON WHO HAS ALL THE EXPERT TEAS TO HELP US FIGURE OUT HOW TO BEST MANAGE OR HELP CHALLENGES THI THIN WHAT WE HAVE NOT FIGURED OUT OR COUPLE THINGS AND FOR ONE WHO ARE ALL THE RIGHT PEOPLE WHO NEED TO BE IN THE ROOM AOR VER THE SORT OF VERTUALE ROOM IF YOU WILL THE SECOND IS HOW TO WE CREATE A A STRUCTURE A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WHERE THAT CAN ACTUALLY HAPPEN WITH EFFICIENCY WHERE CAN BE REINVERSE APPROPRIATELY BUT THAT' WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING AND THEN THE THIRD LEG OF THAT IS THE THE GROUP EXPERIENCE FOR PATIENCS RIGHT AND THERE'S INCREASINGLY IN A MORE CLENICS AND HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS ARE ON THE COUNTRY THAT AR WORKING ON CREATING GROUP EXPERIENCES WHERE PATIENTS WHO ALL LET SAY AR WORKING ON DIBE ON THEIR DIBETES A COME TOGETHER LET SAY ONCE A WEE EK AND THEY MEET WITH THE HELF CARE PRACTICIONER THAT MIGHT BE IN ADDITION TO THEIR INDIVIDUAL APPOINTMENTS BUT THERE IS SO MUCH POWER IN GROUPS COMING TOGETHER IGROUPS OF PATIENTS WHO CAN FIND COMMUNITY WHO CAN HELP EACH OTHER LEARNED FROM EACH OTHERAS EXPERIENCES THAT'S HIGHLY UNDER UTILIZED RIGHT NOW IN MEDICIN IM BUT TO REALLY DO THIS WELL ANDREW THEY MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO PULL BACK FROM THE MODEL WE HAVE HAD FOR YEARS IN MEDICINE WHICH HAS BEEN A VERY A HIGHLY INDIVIDUAL I TYPE MODEL WHICH SAYS OKEY YOU GO TO YOUR DOCTOR YOU SEE YOUR DOCTOR ONE ON ON YOU GET EVERYTHING YOU NEED MAYBE YOU NEED TO GO SEE SPECIALSIC THAN YOU WAIT A FEW WEEKS GET ANOTHER POINTMEN DRIVE THIRTY MILES GO SEE SOMEBODY ELSE MAYBE THEY'R CONNECTED TO THE ECTRONIC HELPSISAN MAYBE THE'RE NOT MAYBETHEY KNOW WHAT WAS DISCUSS ME THEY THEY DON'T MAYBE THEY'LL CALL AND TALK TO THEIR PRIMI CURE DOCTOR BUT MAYBE THEY WON'T CO THE'RE TOO BUSY AND THAT YOU IS A PATIENT ARE STUCK TRONAPIECE ALL THIS TOGETHER WHAT WILL OFTEN IN PAIN WILL YET IN IN PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL ANGUISH EN OFFERING TO MY OWN EXPERIENCE AL THAT I'VE HAD OU MILD EXAMPLES COMPARED TO WHAT OTHER PEOPLE DEALT WITH BUT  PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC FIT PAIN OR IRRITABLE FOR UNDERSTANDABLE REASONS I MAN ITIT IT'S OR MAYBE SOMEBODY'S CLOSE VEERING TOWARDS SUICIDEAL DEPRESSION THEN THERE'S THE INTERPERSONAL EFFACTS I MAN I FEEL LIKE TH THE CRISISIS IS ONE OF A LACK OF EFFICIENCY AND THOROUGHNESS AND I'M AN AGAIN I'M NOT THROWING STONES OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION I I LIKE YOU BELIEVE THAT IT'S A COLLESSION OF MOSTLY A WELL MEANING PEOPLE TRUN TO DO THEIR BEST BUT THE SPECIALIST MODEL AND THE REFERAL MODEL IS INCREDIBLY COMBERSON IT REALLY IS CUMBRSSOM AND AND LIKE YOU LOOK I HAVING WORKED WITH MANY MEDICAL PROFESSIONS OVER THE YEARS I THESE ARE CALLI SO I DEEPLY ADMIRE MENG THAT THEY'RE THERE FOR THE RIGHT REASONS THEY WONT TO HELP PEOPLE ALLEVIATE SUFFERING BUT THEY TOO ARE FEELING BURNED OUT AND PROSTRATED BY THE INEFFICIENCIES OF THE SYSTEM AS I'L TELL YOU ONE OF THE GREATEST CONTRIBUTORS TO BURN OUT FOR DOCTORS AND NURSES IS THEY LACK OF SELF EFFICACY IT'S SEEING A PATIENT WHO HAS A PROBLEM IN FRONT OF YOU AND FEELING LIKE YOU CAN'T GET THEM TO HELP THAT THEY NEED THAT IS THE THE GREATEST PAPER COT IF YOU WILL A TO THE SORT OF SPIRIT OF CLINITIONS AND MANY FIND THEMSELVES IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE THEY EITHER FIND THAT THEY KNOW WHAT'S NEEDED BUT THE SYSTEM IS THROWING UP PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS OR OTHER INSURANCE HURTLES AND PREVENTING THEIR PATIENT FROM GETTING THAT CARE OR THEYARE KIND OF AT THE EDGE OF THEIR EXPERTEES RIGHT THIS HAPPENS TO PEDIATRICIONS AND PRIMARY CAREDOTCHES MORE BROADLY ALL THE TIME WITH MENTAL HELP RIGHT MOST OF THE MENTAL HEALTH CARE THAT'S DELIVERED IN THIS COUNTRY IS DELIVERED IN PRIMARY CARE OFFICES RIGHT NOW PRIMARY CURIDOSHIS I NECESSARILY TRAIN SPECIFICALLY AND ONLY IN MENTAL HEALTH YET THEY FIND THEMSELVES HAVING TO MANAGE A LOT OF THAT INCLUDING INCREASINGLY COMPLEX SUBSTANCE USED DISORDERS AAND YOU TREATMENT RESISTANT DEPRESSION AND THEY NEED HELP FIGURING THAT OUT BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF RESOURCES TO GET THAT REFERAL TO COLLABORATE WITH THE MOUNT AL HELP PROFESSIONALS AND YOU'RE STUCK ON YOUR OWN FIGURING THAT OUT AND SO YOUI THINK THE PAIN IS BEING EXPERIENCED MOSTLY BY PATIONS AND BUT ALSO VERY MUCH SO BY CLINITIONS AND THAT'S WHY THAT OVERHAUL IS NEEDED AND II THINK LOOK A LOT OF THIS IS YOU KNOW I'M NOT TO HELP CURE ECONOMIS PERSAY BUT I WILL SAY THAT A LOT OF THIS THAT THING EIS TIED INTO THE BUSINESS MODEL THAT WE BUILT AROUND MEDICINE THE NOTION THAT I'M YOU KNOW WHERE PAYING INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE FOR INDIVIDUAL SERVICES AND INDIVIDUAL PROCEDURES THAT ARE DONE I WHILE THAT HAS SOME MERIT IN SOME CASES WHAT WE REALLY CARE ABOUT IS THAT THE PERSONS GETTING EFFICIENT INTEGRATED MULTI DISCIPLINARY CARE OVER ALL AND SO WHEN HELP SYSTEMS FOR EXAMPLE COME TOGETHER AND SAY IF YOU'RE RATHER THAN AM SORT OF FOCUSSING ON THE AMOUNT OF GETTING REINVERSE ORERY PROCEDURE ROENETT TAKE MORE OF A VALUABAS TO PROCHERE WHER WE SAY OCAV WEE GOT TURN AMOUNT OF MONEY TO CARE FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE WHAT'S A MOST EFFICIENT WAY FOR US TO PROVIDE THEM CARE I RECOGNIZING IF WE DON'T DO THAT IT'S NOT ONLY BAD FOR THEM BUT OUR COST IN THE LONG TERM WELL GO UP BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GETTING REINVERSE FOR EVERY PROCEDU R WERE GETTINGEN RE INVERSED FOR THE THE CARE OVER ALL CARE THAT WE'RE TAKING FOR A PATION SO THEY'RE MORE OF THESE VALUE BASED MODELS THAT ARE OUR BEING ADOPTED I CERTAINLY IN TWO THOUSAND INTEN WHEN THE AFFORDABLE CAREACT WAS PASSED AND WHEN OTHER MEASURES WERE TAKEN IN THE ABOM ADMENISTRATION TIN METI CARE LIKE THAT REALLY PUSHED VALUE BASE PAYMENT MODELS FORWARD I'M AND AGAIN THEY'RE NOT PERFECT THEY'VE GOT THEY THEY NEED THEIRE OWN TWEEKS BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THE EXISTING FINANCIAL STRUCTURE THAT WE HAD IN MEDICINE WAS SERVING US INTERMS OF DELIVERING THE KIND OF MULTI DISCIPLINARY INTEGRADED EFFICIENT CARE THAT WE INCREASINGLY NEED TOUGH PROBLEM BUT THROUGH RECOGNITION OF TOUGH PROBLEMS COMES GOOD SOLUTIONS THAT'S MY BELIEF IM MONOPTIMIUS AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU MENTION MENTAL HEALTH AD LATELY YOUVE BEEN INCREASINGLY VOCAL ABOUT THE CRISIS OF ISOLATION JUST WONES I ANDREW BEFORE WE GO THERE ISONE THEY O THAT THE TOUGH PROMS ARE YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT AND THE PROBLEM IS A LONGER WE TAKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND ADDRESS THESE TOUGH PROBLEMS THE MORE INTRENCHED THE INTERESTS BECOME THAT PROFIT FROM THE SATIST QUOIL RIGHT SO IF YOU LOOK AT I'M THE PRIVATE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IRIGHT NOW THERE ARE SO MANY CHALLENGES WE HAVE RIGHT NOW WITH PATIENTE INCLINATIONS SAYING THAT THEY KNOW WHAT CARE IS NEEDED BUT IT GETS DENIED THEY KNOW WHAT CARE S NEEDED BUT PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS YOU KNOW GET THROWN UP THERE AND REQUIRED I EVEN FOR A MEDICINE THAT CLEARLY YOUR PATIENT NEEDS URGENTLY YOU KNOW I'VE HAD THE EXPERIENCE MYSELF OF HAVING A FAMILY MEMBER WHOSE NEEDED A MEDICATION FOR AN URGENT SITUATION AND THEN BEING TOLD THAT THE FARMERSEY WILL NOT FILL IT TBECAUSE IT REQUIRES THER PRIOR AUTHORIZATION BUT THAT CAN'T BE PROCESSE UNTIL THE WEEK END IS OVER BECAUSE NO ONES IN THE OFFICE TO APPROVE THE PRIOR AUTHORSATION AND YOU'R THNKING YOURSELF THIS IS MAKE ANY SENSE LIKE THIS IS AN URGENT SITUATION MY FAMILY MEMBER NEEDS HIS MEDICATION I'VE ALSO HAD THE EXPERIENCE AS A DOCTOR OF FIGHTING FOR MY PATIENCE WHO HAVE BEEN DENIED CARE BY AN INSURANCE COMPANY BEING ON THE FO AN SAYING I AM SITTING HERE IN FRONT OF MY PATION I KNOW THAT THEY ARE SICK I KNOW THEY CAN'T GO HOME I KNOW THEY NEED TO BE IN REHAD THERE'S NOBODY LITERALLY TO HELP THEM AT HOME BUT THEN NOT HAVING TA THE REHAB TAT APPROVED BY SOMEBODY WHO'S NOT EVEN THERE RIGHT AND THERE'S ALSO JUST A A PRACTICE THAT WE'VE SEEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN WHERE INSURANCE COMPANIES WILL ALSO JUST BURDON CLINATIONS WITH MORE AND MORE REQUEST FOR INFORMATION BEFORE THEY WILL AGREE TO REIMERSE FOR SERVICES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN DELIVERED FOR PATIONT WHO NEEDS THEM WHICH IS JUST CRATING MORE AND MORE BARRIERS HOPING THAT F YOU'RE SMALL TIME DOCK OUT THERE WHO'S GOT YOU KNOW YOU SHINGLE THAT YOU PUT UP YOU O NOF A LOTT OR RESOURCES OW ARE YOUN TO KEEP FIGHTING ALL THIS AND SENDING MORE MORE PEOPLE WORKINSEVENTUALLYOU'LL JUST GIVE UP I'M WE'VE A LOT OF PROBLEMS RIGHT THERE IN IN INDUSTRU THERE SHOULD BE DELIVERING CARE OFTEN IS DOING GOOD THINGS BUT TOO OFTEN I THINK IS ALLOWING BARRIERS TO BE PUT UP ON TO THE CARE THAT'S NEEDED AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND OVERE AN A TALK ABOUT THAT BUT MENTAL HEALTH CARE IS JUST BEEN SUCH A DIFFICULT THING FOR PEOPLE TO GET IN OUR COUNTRY AND PART OF THE REASON THER MANY REASONS WOR ONE OF THEM IS THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES HISTORICALLY DID NOT REIMBERSE ADEQUATELY OUT WERE IN THE SAME LEVEL FOR MENTAL HEALH CARES IT DID FOR PHYSICAL HEALTH CARE OR IF THEY DID THEY WOULD ONLY REIMBERSE FOR A LIMITED NUMBER OF SESSIONS THAT YOU COULD HAVE I BUT HOW IF YOUF YOUARE A MAM OUT THERE WHO SEES HER CHILD'S STRUGGLING WIT DEPRESSION YOU'RE REALLY WORRIED I'M YOU DON'T WANT TO BE TOLD YOU KNOW WHAT I YOU CAN ONLY GET THERE SESSIONS THAT'S IT WHAT AR YOU SO AS TO DO AFTER THREE SESSIONS RIGHT AND SO WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS IT EVEN THOUGHIN TWO THOUSAND IN EIGHT THERE WAS A LAW PAST CALLED THE A DICTION I EQUITY AND MENTAL HEALPARITY LAW YOVEN THOGH THAT WAS PASSED TO TRY TO CLOSE THAT GAP THERE WERE MANY WAYS THAT IN TURN'S COMPANIES WERE SKIRTING IT I SO ONE OF THE LAW WASN'T EVEN BEING ADEQUALLY REINFORCED FOR MANY ARS BUT TOO INTRENTE COMPANY SOMETIMES WITH SALCA YOU DON'T WE REINBERSING ADEQUATELY BUT WHEN YOU LOOK IN THE NETWORK THEY HAD VERY FEW PROVIDERS SO YOU REALLY COULDN'T ACCESS SOMEBODY RITESO THAT WAS A PROBLEM FOR PATIENCE AND THEN THE OTHER CHALLENGE IS THAT THEY WOULD SAY O CAYE YOU CAN SEE SOMEBODY BUT YOU'VE GOT A COMPLETE THIS PRIOR AUTHORIZATION HAVE THI COMPLETED BY YOUR PRIMARY OCARRYDOCTOR ET CETERA YENT THROWING HAVE MORE AND MORE BARRIERS SO VERY RECENTLY IN BACT JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO APRESENT BY NJUST ANNOUNCE THAT WE ARE FROM AS ADMINISTRATION PUTTING OUT A PROPOSED RULE TO ACTUALLY STRENGTHEN A THE METAL HEALTH PARRITY LAW TO PREVENT SOME OF THESE WHAT I THINK OF IS ABUSEIVE PRACTICES BECAUSE THEY'RE PREVENTING PEOPLE WHO NEED CARE FROM GETTING IT AND IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN AS THEY KNOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WHO ARE LISTENING TO THIS IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU OR SOMEBODY YOU LOVE HAS STRUGGLED WITH E MENTAL HEALTH CONCERN WE YOU NEED IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE IS HELP YOU DON'T NEED TO BE FILLING OUT PAPER WORK YOU DON'T NEED TO BE WAITING THREE MONTHS ACTUALLY GET CARE YOU NONEED TO SHOW UP AND BE TOLD ONLY ONLY IF TWO MORE APPOINTMENTS YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT HELP IS THERE WHEN YOU NEED IT AND A LOT OF THESE DENIALS ARE ARE BEING ISSUED TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE DONE THERE THEY'RE PART OF THE BARGAIN THEYE PAID THEIR PREMIUMS THEY'VE HELD UP THEIR END OF THE BARGAIN AND CARE SHOULD BE THERE FOR THEM WHEN THEY NEED IT SO ANY THIS ISOMETHING THAT UPSETS ME ALOT BECAUSE I JUST I HAVE SEEN TOO MANY PATIENTS OVER THE YEARS STRUGGLE WITHOUT THE CARE THAT THEY DESERVE AND SHOULD GET BECAUSE THE BEARS ARE BEENGTHROWN UP AH BY INDUSTRY BUT I SAY ALL THAT JUST TO SAY THAT WE YOU TAKE ON BIG PROBLEMS YOU WILL RUN UP AGAINST ENTRENCHED INTERESTS AND THAT'S A FIGHT WE HAVE TO TAKE ON WE CAN'T SHY AWAY FROM IT WE CAN'T SAY IN UTS IS POLITICALLY TOO DIFFICULT LIKE ONE OF THINGS ON VERY PROUD OF AS IT WERE FINALLY NEGOTIATING ON DRUG PRICES  THROUGH THE MEDICARE PEROGRAM SOMETHING THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE DECATES AGO BUT IT'S FINALLY HAPPENING NOW A ME KNOTH ADMINISTRATION JUSTCIDE OF THIS IS GOT TO HAPPEN IT WAS PASS BY CONGRESS IS IS GOOD A AND WE JUST T MAKES NO SENSE THAT WE WOULD PAY MORE THAN WE NEED TO AND PAST THE COST ON TO TAXPAYERS I WHEN WE CAN NEGOTIATE AND WE GOT A GET ITLOOK YOU GOT O IF YOU'RE COLLECTING TAXES AS GOVERNMENT YOU SHOULD BE DOING YOUR BES TO MAKE SURE EVERY ONE OF THOSE DOLLARS IS BEING SPENT WELL RI CA SOMEBODY TOOK MONEY AD ED THEIR PACHECK I DIDN'T USE IT FOR THEIR FAMILY DIDN'TG USE IT FOR THEIR KIDS AND THEY GAVE IT TO THE GOVERNMENT FOR GOOD REASON BECAUSE THAT SUPPORTS FIRST RESPONDER AS POLICE OFFICERS OLD BUNCH OF SERVICES THAT WE NEED BUT THE RESPONSE MEIN GOVERNMENT IS TO MAKE IO THAT MONEY'S BEENG USED WELL AND TO PAY MORE FOR MEDICATIONS TAND WE SHOULD MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL  ESPECIALLY FOR IMPATIENCE AND TAX PARS SO CLEARLY SOME STEPS IN THE REGHT DIRECTION ARE OCCURRING WHILE ON THE TOPIC OF MENTAL HEALTH UM LET'S TALK ABOUT ICE THE ISOLATION CRISIS IWHAT IS THE ISOLATION CRISIS WHAT ASPECTS OF MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH IS IT IMPACTING AND THEN I'M PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY WHAT CAN WE EACH AN ALL DO ABOUT IT WELL THIS IS ONE OF THOSE ISSUES THAT I IF YOU HAD TOLD ME ANDREW TEN YEARS AGO HAV YOU AND IRN ME SITTING HERE TALKING ABOUT LONELINESS AN ISOLATION I WOUND TO SAID I DON'T THINK SO BUT I WAS REALLY EDUCATED BY PEOPLE I MEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM AND THE TRUTH IS IT WAS FAMILIAR TO ME BECAUSE OF MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCES NAS A CHILD I STRUGGLED A LOT WITH SENSE OF LONELINESS AND ISOLATION AS REALLY SHY AS A KID I WAS PRETTY INTERVERTED AND I WANTED A TO MAKE FRIENDS AND AN GOUT WITH OTHER KIDS BUT IT TOOK ME A WHILE ACTUALLY BUILD OSE RELATIONSHIP SO IM I SPENT A LOT OF TIME FEELING LEFT OUT YOU KNOW THERE WERE TIMES WHEN I I I I WOULDT LIKE MEN AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS AND TEVER DAYS WHERE I PRETENDED I HAD A STOMACHIC AD SO MY MAM WOULDN'T A MAKE ME GO TO SCHOOL AND IT WASN'T CAS I'VE SCARE OF BATTEST OR TEACHER SENDIN WONE I LIKE WALK INTO THE CAFITERIA ONE MORE TIME I BE SCARED THAT THERE WAS NOBODY TO SIT NEXT TO WOR THAT KNO ONE WOULD WANT ME TO I TO BE AT THEIR BENCH UM I AS I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE AN I ALSO KNOW WHAT THE SHAME AS LIKE AS I NEVER TOLD MY PARENTS ABOUT THIS I NEVER TOLD ANY ONE ABOUT THAT BECAUSE EVEN THOGH I KNEW MY PARENTS LOVED ME I JUST FELL LIKE HA IF I'M FEELING THIS LONELY IT MEANS THAT SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH ME I'M NOT LIKABLE I'M NOT LOVABLE I'M SOME'S GOT TO BE IT'S GOT ME MY FAULT IN SOME WAY IT WAS ONLY YEARS LATER ANDREW WHEN I TALKED TO FRIENDS FROM GREAT SCHOOL THAT I REALIZE THAT A LOT OM WERE FEELING THE SAME THING WE WERE ALL STRUGGLING BY OURSELVES I NO ONE REALLY KNEW IT AND I CAME TO SEE A LOT OF THIS IS A DOCTOR WHEN I SEEKEN CARE PATIENCE AN I NEVER TOOK A CLASS ON LONELINESS AN MEDICAL SCHOOL WAS ON PART OF OUR RESIDENCY CRRICULUM YET WHEN I SHOWED UP IN THE HOSPITAL I FOUND THAT THE PATIENT WHO HAD COME IN WITH EADIABETIC WOUND INFECTION OR WHO AD COME IN IMEU BECAUSE THEY HAD HAD A HEART ATTAK WHEN I SAT DOWN AND TALKED TO THEM OFTEN IN THE BACKGROUND THEY WOULD TALK ABOUT HOW LONELY THEY WERE SOMETIMES I WOULD ASKE SOM HEY I YE WERE I NEED TO HAVE A DIFFICULT CONVERSATION ABOUT YOUR DIAGNOSISES OR SOMEBODY YOU'D WANT ME TO CALL I TO BE WITH YOU DURING THIS TIME AND TOO OFTEN THE ANSWER WAS YE I WISH THERE WAS BUT THERE'S NOBODY I'LL JUST HAVE THE CONVERSATION BY MYSELF SO BUT IT WAS WHEN I WAS SERE A GENTLE I REALIZED THAT THOSE EXPERIENCES WEREN'T LIMITED TO ME IN MY PATIENCE THEY WERE INCREDIBLY COMMON AND TWO THINGS I LEARNED WHEN I DUG INTO THE DATA ANDREW WAS NEMBER ONE THAT LONELINESS IS EXCEEDINGLY COMMON WITH ONE AND TWO ADULTS AND AMERICA REPORTING MEASERABLE LEVELS OF LONELINESS BUT THE NUMBERS ARE ACTUALLY EVEN HIGHER AMONG YOUNG ADULTS AND ADOLESCENCE THE NUMBERS AND AMONG AYOUTH ACTUALLY DEPENDING ON THE SURVEYS YOU LOOK AT ARE BETWEEN SEVENTY TO EIGHTY PERSENT I WHO SAY THAT THEY WERE STRUGGLING I WITH LONELINESS SO THAT'S THE FIRST THING THAT I LEARNED BUT THE SECOND THING WAS HOW CONSEQUENTIAL LONELINESS WAS I USED TO THINK LONELINESS WAS JUST A BAD FEELING WHUT I CAME TO SEE IND DIGGING INTO THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE WAS THAT FEELING SOCIALLY DISCONNECTED BE LONELY AND ISOLATED WAS ACTUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED RISK OF DEPRESSION ANXIETY SUICIDE BUT ALSO IN INCREASE RISK OF CART OFASKER DISEASE OF DEMENTHA AND THESE ARE NOT SMALL RISKS WER TALKING ABOUT TWENTY NINE PER CENT INCREASE IN THE RISK OF ORDINARY HART DISEASE THIRTY ONE PER CENT RISK IN THE INCREASE RISK OF STROKE FIFTY PER CENT INCREASE RISK OF DIMENTIHA AMONG OLDER PEOPLE INCREASE RISK OF PREMATURE DEATH AND THE MORTALITY IN PACT OF OF LONELINESS BY THE WAY AND LONELINESS AN ISOLATION I IS COMPARABLE I YOU KNOW TO THE MORTALITY IMPACK OF MANY OTHER ILLNESSES IN FACT IT'S EVEN GREATER THAN THE MORTALITY IMPACK WE SEE ASSOCIATED WITH OBISITY WHICH IS SOMETHING WE CLEARLY RECOGNIZE AS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE SO YOU PUT ALL THIS TOGETHER AND FOR ME ONE OF THE KEY TAKE AWAYS IS THAT LONELINESS AND ISOLATION OUR CRITICAL PUBLIC HEALTH CHALLENGES THAT OUR HIDING  BEHIND THE CURTAIN BEHIND THIS WALL OF STIGMA AND SHAME AND UNLESS WE TALK ABOUT IT AND ADDRESS IT UNLESS WE RECONCILE WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING TO US OVER THE LAST FIFTY YEARS WHERE FEWER AND FEWER PEOPLE ARE PARTICIPATING IN COMMUTY ORGANIATIONS ORE AND MORE MORE PEOPLE ARE FEELING ISOLATED THAN WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO REPAIR THE FRAYING FOUNDATIONS OF SOCIETY WHICH ARE GROUNDED FUNDAMENTALLY IN OUR CONNECTION TO ONE ANOTHER YOU MENTION COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS NOM COULD YOU ELABORATE ON THOSE A OU GROWING UP IN THE SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES I WAS EXPOSED TO LIKE COMMUNITY SOCARTEIMS SWIM TEAM THOSE A COMMUNITY POOL THESE ROYAL PUBLIC A THINGS AF THERE WERE A CHURCHES SINAGOGUS AND MOSKS ARE WE NOT SEEING AS MUCH PARTICIPATION IN THOSE THOSE TYPES OF ORGANIZATIONS ANY MORE AND WHAT OTHER TYPES OF ORGANIZATIONS ARE OR OUT THERE THAT AM YOU'LL COME TO MIND WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE ISOLATION CRISES YES O THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL FACTORS THAT HAVE LED TO US BEING AS ISOLATED AS WE ARE ONE OF THEM AS YOU MENTION IS HE DECLINE IN PARTICIPATION IN COMMITTEE ORGANIZATIONS THIS ISN'T A RECENT PHENOMENON THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING OVER THE LAST HALF CENTURY IN AMERICA WE'VE SEEN LOR PARTICIPATION AND FAITH ORGANIZATIONS IND RECREATIONAL LEAGUES IN SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER COMMUTEE ROUPS IT USED TO BRING US TOGETHER AND I THINK YOU AT WE CAN TALK ABY THE REASONS WHY THAT HAS BEEN THE CASE BUT ONE OF THE KEE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT IS THE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE PLACES WHERE THEY CAN COME TOGETHER AND GET TO KNOW ONE ANOTHER ESPECIALLY A CROSS DIFFERENCES SO WE ACTUALLY ASSOCIATE MORE AND MORE WITH PEOPLE WHO AR LIKE US BUT THIS IS ALSO MEEN FUEL BY A FEW OTHER FACTORS ITHETTERE GOING ON AT THE SAME TIME ONE IS THAT JUST FROM A CULTURAL PERSPECTIVE AS MADERNITY HAS ARRIVED NOT JUST A YOU ASK BUT ANOTHER OTHER COUNTRIES WE'VE SEEN THA PEOPLE ARE MORE MOBILE RIGHT THEY MOVE AROUND MORE BE DON'TALWAYS STAY IN THE COMMUNITY THAT WE GREW UP IN WE TEND TO EVEN IF WE MOVE SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR SCHOOL WE MAY GO SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR A JOB WE MAY CHANGE SOPS AND MOVE SOMEWHERE ELSE WE ARE LEAVING BEHIND COMMUNITIES THAT WE GREW UP WITH THAT WE WENT TO SCHOOL WITH THAT WE WORKED WITH AND I'M NOT SAY THAT'S ALL A BAD THING RIGHT WE'RE HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITIES AND THAT'S A REALLY GOOD THING BUT I THINK ONE THING THAT WE HAVE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR IS THE COST OF THESE CHANGES RIGHTS IF WE KNOW WHAT THE COSTS ARE OF CERTAIN ACTIONS WE MAY STILL TAKE THOSE ACTIONS BUT WE MAY FIND WAYS O MITIGATE THAT THE COSTS WE MAY IN THIS CASE INVEST MORE IN OUR RELATIONSHOULDS WE MORE CONSCIOUS OFOUR REACHING OUT TO OTHER PEOPLE GOING TO VISIT THEM BUT THAT HAS BEEN A A QUIET BUT BEDEVISTATING CONSEQUENCE THE OTHER PIECES WITH MATERNITY IS THAT WE HAVE MORE CONVENIENCE IN OUR LIFE WHICH MEANS THAT WE ALSO DON'T NEED TO SEE OTHER PEOPLE TO GET CERTAIN THINGS DONE LIKE BIN GROCERIES OR MAILING AND IDAM OUT OR GETTING SOMETHING FROM THIS STORE I CAN SIT IN THE COMFORT OF MY HOME AND HAVE EVERYTHING JUST COME TO ME NOW ON THE ONE HAND THAT'S INCREDIBLY EFFICIENT IGHT BUT I THINK EFFICIENCY IS AN INTERESTING THING BECAUSE IT'S ONLY ONE FACTOR WE SHOULD BE CONSIDEING IN OUR LIVES THEY ARE TOO WE HAVE TO ASK THE COSTS AND ONE IS JUSTAN THEY MET COVIT AS MANY PEOPLE IN THE FIRST YEAR OF COVEN WE ARE ALL SEPARATED FROM ONE ANOTHER YOU KNOW WHEN WE FINALLY CAME BACK TOGET HING AND I HAD SO MANY PEOPLE WHO SAID TO MEUNOIT I EXPECTED TO MISS MY PARENTS AND MY SYBLINGS AND MY FRIENDS NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE THEM WHAT I DIDN'T EXPECT WAS MISSING THE STRANGERS THAT I SAW T THE COFFEE SHOP WERE THE FOLKS HO IR RAN INTO THE GROCERY STORE OR SEEING NEIGHBOURS AS I WALKE DOWN THE STREET LIC I ACTUALLY MISS THAT MORE THAN I THOUGHT I WOUGE SO WE HAVE LOST OUT ON SOME OF THOSE INTERACTIONS IN THOSE LOOSE TIES BUT THE FINAL THING TO KEEP IN MIND ALSO IS ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH HOW WE ARE USING SOCIAL MEDIAE TECHNOLOGY WHICH I THINK IS FUNDAMENTALLY TRANSFORMED HOW WE INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER AND HOW WE SEE OURSELVES AND EACH OTHER AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO'RE GROWING UP AS DIGINAL NATIVES BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED THERE I WORRY IS THAT AND IT HAS THOUGHT THAT SOCIAL METERS ALL BAT JUST TO BE CLEAR IN A TECHNOLOGY LOOK I I'M A BELIEVER THAT IN TECHNOLEGY BROADLY SPEAKING YOU KNOW I USE OER OF TECHNOLEGY ISSPENT SEVEN YEARS BUILDING A TE COMPANY I'M A BELIEVER IN TACT BUT I THINK WHETHER TECHNOLOGY HELPS OR HURTS US IS ABOUT HOW IT'S DESIGNED AND ALTIMY ABOUT HOW IT ENTS O BEING USED AND BUT WE'VE SEEN WITH SOCIAL METI AS WELL IS THAT FOR MANY PEOPLE IT ENDED UP LEEDING TO IN PERSON CONNECTIONS BEING REPLACED WITH ON MINE CONNECTIONS IM WE CAME TO SOMEHOW VALUE AND IM ALMOST SEEK OUT MORE AND MORE FOLLOWERS AND FRIENDS ON SOCIAL MEDIA FEELING I SOMEHOW THAT MADE US MORE CONNECTED BUT THE NATURE OF DIALOGUE ALSO CHANGED LIKE AS HUMAN BEINGS WE HAVE ALLED OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS THE NOT JUST UNDERSTAND THE WORD SOMEONE IS SAYING BUT TO HEAR THE TONE OF THEIR VOICE TO SEE THEIR FACIAL EXPRESSION LIKE YOU AND I ARE SITTING ACROSS AND AND WE'RE BOTH PROCESSING LIKE OUR BODY LANGUAGE RIGHT AND I'M SEEING YOU KNOD YOUR HEAD AND I'M SEEING YOUR EYES FOCUS LIKE ALL OF THAT MATTERS TO HOW WE COMMUNICATE I BUT ALSO LIKE YOU AND I ARE LESS LIKELY TO SAY SOMETHING HURTFUL RIGHT NOW TO ONE ANOTHER BECAUSE WE CAN SEE EACH OTHER IF I SAID SOMETHING OR HURTFUL TO YOU LIKE I PROBABLY SEE THE PAIN OR CO ONSTERNATION ON YOUR FACE AND THAT MIGHT GIVE ME PAUS RIGHT WHEN YOU'RE COMMUNICATING ON LINE WITH OTHER PEOPLE WITHOUT ANY OF THAT INFORMATION OR WITHA ANY OF THE AA SORT OF BARRIERS IF YOU WILL THAT MAKE YOU PAUSE BEFORE YOU HURT SOMEONE IT LEAST A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF COMMUNICATION AONE THAT CAN BE QUITE HURTFUL AT TIMES AND I ALSO THINK THAT WHEN THE PEOPLE MANY PEOPLE DON'T RECOGNIZES THAT TO COMMUNICATE WITH SOMEBODY ELSON REACH OUT AND BUILD AR RELATIONSHIP WITH SOME ONE IT ACTUALLY TAKES A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SELF ESTEEM TO DO THAT YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE THE OTHER PERSONS GOIN A WANT TO HANG OUT WITH YOU THEY WEIRN TO SEE SOMETHING VALUABLE IN YOU AND FOR MANY YOUNG PEOPLE WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND I THINK FRANKLY FROM ANY OLDER PEOPLE TOO IS YOUR EXPERIENCE ON SOCIAL MEDIA HAS SHREDDED THEIR SELF ESTEEM AS THEIRE CONSTANTLY COMPARING THEMSELVES TO OTHER PEOPLE LIKE YOU MAN YOU ANDI WERE GROWING UP A YOU KNOW IN THE EIGHTIES WE WE COMPARED OURSELFES WITH THE PEOPLE TO RIGHT PEOPLE HAVE FOR MILLENNIA BUT WHAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT NOW IS IT IN A GIVEN DAY YOU CAN COMPARE YOURSELF TO THOUSANDS OF IMAGES THAT YOU SEE ON LINE THAT'S ETUALLY LITALLY WHAT PEOPLE YOUNG PEOPLE TELL ME I DO ROUND TAPLES WITH COLITUDNES AND ISHOOL SOONS ALL THE TIME AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT THREE THINGS THEY TELL ME MOST CONSISTENTLY ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE OF SOCIAL MEDIASAND MAKES THEM FEEL WORSE ABOUT THEMSELVES WORSE ABOUT THEIR FRIENDSHIPS BUT THEY CAN'T GET OFF IT BECAUSE THE PLATFORMS ARE DESIGNED TO MAXIMIZIM AUT A TIME THEY SPEND ON THEM SO YOU PUT ALL OF THIS TOGETHER AND I THINK WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS THAT WE'RE TALKING MORE BUT WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER LESS WE HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION BUT WE'RE LACKING IN THE WISDOM THAT COMES FROM HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS I AND I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY HURT US YOU KNOW WE SEE IT CERTAINLY IN THE DATA THAT TELLS US ABOUT MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HELTH OUCOMES BUT THERE'S ALSO THE HUMAN SUFFERING COMPONENT ANDREW IK IT'S REALLY HARD BREAKING FOR ME TO TRAVELLER ON THE COUNTRY TO HEAR FROM PEOPLE OF ALL AGES OFTEN IN QUIET WHISPERS ABOUT THEIR STRUGGLES WITH ISOLATION ABOUT HOW THEY FEEL LIKE THE JUST NO MATTER AT ALL ABOUT HOW THEY FEEL LIE THEY JUST DON'T HAVE A PLACE WHERE THEY BELONG AND IT'S THESE ARE PEOPLE ON THE OUTSIDE LOOK PERFECTLY FINE THEY'RE POSTING HAPPY THINGS ON LINE TO THE FOKS AT WORK THEYARE SEEMING LIKE EVERYTHING'S GOING GREAT THIS WAY ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE YOU LONELINESS IS A GREAT MASQUERADER IT CAN LOOK LIKE WITH DRAWAL AND SADNESS THEY CAN LOOK LIKE ANGER AND IRRITABILITY IT CAN LOOK LIKE A LOOFNESS AS WELL AND SO IT'S ONLY WHEN WE STOP TO ASK SOMEONE HOW THEY'RE DOING WHEN WE TANK PAUSE FOR A MOMENT MAY BE REFLECTIN WHAT'S HAPPENING I THEIR LIFE THT WE REALIZE IT WHELE THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY ARE ACTUALLY STRUGGLING WITH LONELINESS I  FIRM BELIEVER THAT OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM INVOLVED UNDER CONDITIONS OF CLOSE INTERPERSONAL AND DIRECT CONNECTION AND UM TO SUDDENLY THROW A TECHNOLOGY IN FRONT OF OURSELVES THAT DEPRIVES OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM OF ITS NORMAL DEVELOPMENT IS IT'S CLEARLY IN TA LY BAD PLACES IT'S ALSO UM CLEAR TO ME AS BASE ON WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBE THAT YOU KNW WHEN WE GO ON SOCIAL MEDIA WE SEE SOMETHING BUT THEY DON'T REALLY SEE US YOU KNOW HENS PERHAPS WIDE PEOPLE GET AM AGGRESSIVE IN THE COMMENT SECTION UM YOU KNOW THAT THEY WON'T TO BE HURT YEUM WE WON'T TO BE SEEN I THINK ALL OF US WANT TO BE SEEN AND SEE OTHER PEOPLE YE AND A SOCIAL MEDIA DOESN'T ALLOW FOR IT SO EASILY UM I ALSO NOW THE LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE WILL CONGREGATE WITH THEIR FRIENDS TO PLAVIDIO GAMES ON LINE BUT THAT'S DIFFERENT YOU'RE YOUR SENTIALLY SHOWING UP AS AN AVATAR AND WHEN YOUR WHEN WE WEREKIDS WE ALSO PLAYED DIFFERENT CHARACTERS IN ARSER AND OUR GAMES UM BUT OH SO DIFFERENT NOW UM DO YOU THINK THAT THERE WILL BE A YOUTH REBELLION MOVEMENT AGAINST UM THESE KINDS OF TECHNOLOGIES AVE MING THERE'S A LONG HISTORY OF OF YOUNG PEOPLE REBELLING AGAINST THE THE STUFF THAT'S BEEN PUT IN FRONT OF THEM AND LIKE NO NO MORE WE'RE GING TO REBELL IN FACT THAT WAS THE WAY THAT YOUTH OVERCAME THE UM THE NICATIN AC EPIDEMIC IF YOU RECALL IT WAS THE ADVERTISING PITCHING THEM AGAINST ARE PITTING AMSCUSE ME AGAINST AM WEALTHY CACKLING OLDER MEN IN CHAR IN ROOMS COUNTING THEIR MONEY THAT WAS WHET HAW SHLY WAS SUCCESSFUL AND GETTING KIDS AND NOT SMOKE BECAUSE KI'S HAVE A REBELLIOUS STREET I SUPPOSED WHEN THEY WERE TOLD HASTE SMOKINGS TERRIBLE FOR YOU YOUR LUNGS ARE GING TO  FILL WITH CANCER KIDSTON STOP SMOKING TEENSTON STOP SMOKING HE WAS OU NO REBELLION HAS BEEN BAKED INTO OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM A IN THE ADOLESCEN INTEEN YEARS SO DO YOU SEE A REBELLION AGAINST THIS IM SOCIAL ISOLATION OR KIDSKAN THAT START PUTTING AWAY THEIR PHONES AND HANGING OUT TOGETHER AGAIN AND THAT'S GET A RESCUE US ANDA THAT'S A WAY OF SAYING WHAT CAN WE DO FOR THEM WHAT CAN THEY DO FOR THEMSELVES AND WHAT CAN WE DO AS ADULTS CAUSE THEYEARE A LOT OF A THE SILENT SUFFERING IS THE THING I ALSO REALLY WORRY ABOUT SO IT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND I THINK THERE IS ALREADY A MOVEMENT THAT'S BUILDING AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE TO CREAT DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM THEMSELVES AND THEY'RE DEVICES AND PRETTICUARLY SOCIAL MEDIA AND IT IT'S IT'S CROPPING UP IN DIFFERENT WAYS I'M MEETING MORE AND MORE SOME OF THESE ARE ORGANIZE EFFORTS BUT I'M ALSO MEETING MORE AFAMILIES WHERE THE PARENTS IT GETS TOGETHER HAVE DECIDED THAT THEY ARE ING TO DELAY USING SOCIAL MEDIA AND YOU KNOW TILL PASS MIDDLE SCHOOLERY IN SOME CASES EVEN LATER OR WERE THERE DECIDING THA THEY GARG TO DRAW BOUNDARIES AROUND  SOCIAL MEDIA USE WER THEY G IN A REPLACE THEYR SMART PHONE WITH A DOMPHONE TAT ALLOWS THEM TO DO THINGS LIKE TAX AND MAKE FONK HALLS AND USE MAPS AND AND IN ALL THAT SELP IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY SOCIAL MEDAPS ON IT THAT THIS IS STILL A SMALL MINORITY AND AND WHERE'S YOU DEALING WITH THA BIT OF A NETWORK EFFECT YOURE RIGHT BECAUSE IF YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO'S NOT ON SOCIAL MEDIA IN YOUR MIDDLE SCHOOL CLASS AND YOU MIGHT FEEL LEFT OUT WHICH IS WHITE SOMPORN FOR PARENTS TO AND AND KITS ACTUALLY DO THIS TOGETHER BUT I DO THINK THAT TO USE YOUR ANALOGY WITH SMOKING THAT ONE THING THAT A THINK MANY YOUNG PEOPLE BRISTLE AGAINST IS THIS NOTION OF BEING MANIPULATED AND USED FOR THE A PROFIT E KOF A SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM AND THE REALITY IS THAT THE AGAIN WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HOW THE FUNDAMENTAL BUSINESS MODEL IS FOR MOST SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS IS BUILT ON HOW MUCH TIME YOU SPEND ON THOSE PLATFORMS THAT TRANSLATES THE AD REVENUE AND THAT TRANSLATES TO THE BOTTOM LINE WHERE'S WHAT I CARE ABOUT AS A PARIN AS SERTAIN GENERAL IS ABOUT HOW WELL THAT TIME IS BEING SPENT IS IT ACTUALLY CONTRUBITING TO THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF A YOUNG PERSON OR OR ISN NOT IS ACTUALLY HARMING THEM AND THIS IS WHERE I THINK WHEN I GO OUT AND TALK TO YOUNG PEOPLE ABOUT THIS NUM BOR ONE I'M SO IMPRESSED BY LOT YOUNG PEOPLE IS THEY THEY ARE TO HAVE A LOT OFTHESE INSIDES THEY'RETHE ONES LIVING IT RIGT THEY ARE NOT THINKING THAT THIS IS ALL YOU KNOW PERFECT AND AND IT'S ALL A PURE BENEFIT HERE THEY ARE THE ONES TELLING ME THAT IT MAKES THEM FEEL WORSE ABOUT THEMSELVES AND IN THEIR FRIENDSHIPS BUT THEY RE ALSO HAVE NO HARD TIME GETTING OFF IT BECAUSE AGAIN OF HOW THESE PLATFORMS AIR DESIGNS ABOUT A THIRD OF ADOLESCENCE AR SAYING THAT THEIR STAYING UP TILL MIDNIGHT OR LATER ON WEAK NIGHTS USING THEIR DEVICES AND LOT OFTHAT A SOCIAL MEDIA USE AND THIS TAKES AWAY FROM SLEEP WHICH WE KNOW AND YOU NOW BETTER THAN ANY ONE IS SO CRITICAL TO THE MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF ALL OF US BUT OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR WHOARE OA CRITICAL FASE ANOW DEVELOPMENT THE OTHER THING THAT IS VERY CONCERNING TO ME IS NEARLY HALF OF ADOLESCENCE SAY THAT USING SOCIAL MEDIA HAS MADE THEM FEEL WORSE ABOUT THEIR BODY IMAGE AS EIR CONSTANTLY COMPARING THEMSELVES SO OTHERS ON LINE AND WE USED TO THINK OF THIS IS JUST GIRLS FOR EXPERIENCE IN THIS ANDY YES IT IS A LOT OF YOUNG GIRLS WHORE EXPERIENCE ING THESE BODY MAGEISSUES BEEN OUTS INCREASINGLY A BOYS AS WELL SO THIS IS HAPPENING ACROSS THE BOARD BUT THE OTHER PIECE ATHING THAT CONCERNS ME THINKING ABOUT METAL HEALT SYMPTOMS IS IT YOU LOOK AT HOW MUCH TIME IHITS ARE USING SOCIAL MEDION AVERAGE ADOLESCENCE ARE USING IT FOR THREEAND A HALF HOURS A DAY ON AVERAGE SO THERE SOCIAL MEDIA TYOUR SOCIAL MEDIA AND THAT MEANS MANY ARE USING IT FOR FAR MORE THAN THAT AND WHAT YOU'RE FINDING THOUGH IS THAT FOR ADOLESCENCE WHO USE IT THREE HOURS OR MORE IN A GIVIN DAY THEIR RISK OF ANXIETY OR DEP ESSION SYMPTOMS DOUBLE I SO AND IF THEY AVERAGE USES THREE IN A HALF DAYS THAT MEANS THA MILLIONS OF KIDS ALL ACROSS OUR COUNTRY THE MAJORITY WER KIDS ARE ARE RISK HERE AND SO YOU KNOW YOU PUT ALL THIS TOGETHER AND AND IT PAINTS A VERY CONCERNING PICTURE WHATEVER BENEFITS THERE MAY BE FOR SOME KIDS OF USING SOCIAL MEDIUM THEYR'S SOME AND WE LAY OUT SOME O THIS IN OUR ADVISORY ON SOCIAL MEDA SOME KIDS FIND SOCHO MEY AS A GREAT WEIGHT EXPRESS THEMSELVES TO REACH OTHER PEOPLE TO FIND SUPPORT ESPECIALLY F THERE FROM A COMMUNITY THAT DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF FOLKSWOR LIKE THEM AROUND EY CAN BE REALLY REASSURING TO CONNECT WITH OTHERS BUT WE CAN'T SAY THET JUST UN THE TO GET THOSE BENEFITS WE HAVE TO SUBJECT OUR CHILDREN TO ALL OF THESE OTHER HARMS IT THAT KIDS ARE EXPERIENCING EXPOSURE TO HARMFUL CONTENT TO HARASSMENT AN BULLING ON LINE SIX OUT A TEN AADOLES AND GIRLS ARE SEEING THEY'VE BEEN APPROACHED BY STRANGERS ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND WAYS TAT MADE THEM FEEL VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AM OUR KIDS IT ARE ALSO FINDING THAT HEALTH PROMOTING ACTIVITIES IN THEIR LIVES ARERE BEING CANNIBALIZED BY THEIR USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA THAT IT'S DETRACTING FROM TIME FOR SLEEP IN PERSON INTERACTION PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND THE EROSION OF SELF ESTEEM REALLY CONCERNS ME AS WELL BECAUSE YOU YOU NEED THAT NOT JUST FOR SOCIAL INTERACTION BUT LIC LOOK AS A AS A FATHER I WANT MY CHILDREN TO GROW UP BEING CONFIDENT ABOUT WHO THEY ARE BEING CALMINFINETE ENOUGH TO BE AUTHENTIC AS THEY SHOW UP IN THE WORLD DO NOT FEEL LIKE THEY NEED TO CREATES SOME BRAND THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM WHO THEY FUNDAMENTALLY ARE JUST TO SELL THAT TO THE WORLD I WANT THEM TO KNOW WHO THEY ARE AND TO BE COMFORTABLE BEING WHO THEY ARE AND TO ENCOURAGE OTHER PEOPLE TO DO THE SAME TO SUPPORT THEM IN THEIR EFFORTS TO BE AUTHENTIC THAT'S AN AL AT MY KITS TO DO THAT'S NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO A LOT OF KIDS ON SOCIAL MEDIA SO I THINK WE NOT ONLY NEED MORE KIDS TO UNDERSTAND THIS AND TO SUPPORT THEM IN THEIR AFFORTS TO CREATE SPACE AND SACRED SPACES AWAY FROM SOCIAL MEDIA BUT WE NEED TO SUPPORT PARENTS HERE TO COSANDRE MIGHT BE CONCERN WITH PARENTS IS WE'VE TAKEN THIS TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS RAPIDLY EVOLVING WHICH WEEDIN GROW UP WITH AS KIDS AND WE'VE TOLD PARENTS YOU MANAGE IT ALL ON YOUR OWN WE PUT THE ENTIRE BURDEN ON PARENTS AND KIDS TO MANAGE THIS AN WHEN WE WERE GROWING UP REUMEMBER THAT MOTOR VEHICAL FATALITIES ARE REALLY HIGH I IN AMERICA AND WE DIDN'T SAY O K YOU KNOWAT THAT'S JUST THE PRICE OF MODERN LIFE WHICH SET EXCEPTET AND KEEP MOVING ON WITH OUR LIVES WE SET HOLD ON WELDN'T HAVE TO GO BACK TO HORSES AND BUGGIES BUT WE ALSO DON'T NEED TO ACCEPT THIS SETHWHAT WE NEED TO MAKE THIS EXPERIENCE SAFER AND SO WE PUT IN PLACE WITH THE ADVOCACY AND SUPPORT OF INCREDIBLE GROUPS LIKE MAD AND OTHERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY I'D ME MOTHERS AGAINST STRUNG DRIVING ULTIMATELY THE GOVERNMENT PUT IN PLACE SAFETY STANDARDS THAT GOT US SEAT BELTS AIR BAGS CRASH TESTING TO MAKE SURE THE FRAME OF CARS WERE ROBUSTS IN THE SETTING OF AN ACCIDENT AND THAT HELPED US REDUCE MOTERVIICAL ACCIDENTS AND DEBTS AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED HERE TOO LIKE WE NEED TO HAVE THE BACKS OF PARENTS AND KIDS AND THAT MEANS FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE PUTTING IN PLACE SAFETY STANDARDS O PROTECT KIDS FROM EXPOSURE TO HARMFUL CONTENT FROM EFROM THE EXPERIENCE OF BULLING AND HARASSMEN AN THAT ALSO PROTECT THEM FROM FEATURES THAT WOULD SEEK TO MANIPULATE THEM INTO ACCESSIVE USE WHICH IS HAPPENING FAR TOO OFTEN RIGHT NOW WE ALSO NEED TO POLICY THAT REQUIRES DATA TRANSPARENCY FROM THE COMPANIES YOU KNOW RESEARCHERS TELL US ALL THE TIME THAT THEY IS THEIR INDEPENDENT RESEARCHERS THEY TELL US THEY ORE HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING FULL ACCESS TO THE DATA FROM THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS ABOUT THE FULL IMPACT OF THE PLATFORMS ON THE METAHALTO KIDS AS A PARENT LOOK I I DON'T WHEN WE BOUGHT CAR SEATS FOR MY CHILDREN WHEN WHEN THEY WERE BORN WE LOOKED UP THE SAFETY DATA LIKE MANY PARENTS WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THE CARSEATS WERE SAFE BUT IF YOU HAD TOLD ME THAT HEY YOU KNOW THE MANUFACTURES OF THESE CARSEATS RASHLY NOT DISCLOSING SOME OF THE DATA ON THE IMPACT ON CHILDREN BUT GO HADN'T BIDE ANYWAY YOU KNOW I'M SURE OTHER PEOPLE AR BYIN THESE CARSEAS YOU SHOULD BE FINE I WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY DISTURBED BY THAT I NO PARENT WANTS O FEEL THAT INFORMATIONS BEING HIDDEN FROM THEM ABOU T THEY HEALTH AN PACKED UP PRODUCTS ON THEIR KIDS THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW SO THIS IS A PLACE WHERE I THINK WHILE YES AND WHAT WILL WESHA WELL TALK ABOUT SOME SEPS PARENTS CAN TAKE I ASG WINT TO GET TO PRACTICAL SEPS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE IS PARENTS FOR PEOPLE OF KIDS IN THEIR LIVES CAN TAKE BUT WE WE WE NEED POLICY MAKERS A STEP UP AND STEP INTO THE AVOID HERE AND TO FILL THE GAP BECAUSE THIS IS TOO MUCH AGAIN TO JUST ASK PARENTS TO MANAGE ENTIRELY ON THEIR OWN AND THIS ISN'T AGAIN ABOUT TELLING PARENTS WHAT TO DO AND RESTRICTING THEM THIS IS ABOUT GIVING THEM TO SUPPORT THEY NEED SO THEY HAVE CONFIDENTS I WHEN THEY SEE  YOU KNOW AND I TACKNOLEGY OUT THEIR DEVICE OUT THEIR PRODUCT OUT THERE FOR KIDS THAT THEY KNOW IT'S BEEN TESTED THAT IT'S BEEN STUDY AND THAT IT'S ACTUALLY SAFE FOR THEIR CHILDREN MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IN A COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA THERE ARE LIMITS AS TO HOW MANY HOURS KIDS CAN BE ON SCREENS PERIOD ND WHEN I WAS A KID WE WERE ALLOWED TO WATCH T V FOR A CERTAIN NUMBER OF I THING ITWAS A HALF AN HOUR RNOW ME ON WAS CONSTANTLY KICKING USOUT OF THE HOUSE LITRELY YOU GOT TO LEAVE THE HOUSE YOU GOT TO GO DOWN THE STREET AND PLAY YE UNFORTUNATELY I LIKED OUT DOOR ACTIVITIES AUM NOWADAYS WE ALSO HAVE THE ISSUE THAT A LOT OF PARENTS ARE ON THEIR PHONES THAT SOCKER GAMES AND IT KIDS EVENTS AND SO THE KIDS ARE MODELLING THEIR PARENTS YE AN PARENTS ARE DISTRACTED AS WELL SO THERE'S LACK OF SOCIAL CONNECTION PEOPLE EVEN AN IMMEDIATE FAMILY PEOPLE ARE SCREENED IN A BENON TEV THERE'S LAPTOPS THERE'S MULTILEPHONES EYE PADS PEOPLE ARE YOU MORE ENGAGED IN THE SCREEN PORTOLS THAN OFTEN THEN THEIR OWN PORTALS THAT YOU GO TO A CONCERT AND PEOPLE ARE WATCHING THE CONCERT THROUGH THEIR SCREEN SO THAT THEY CAN SEND THE SAME IMAGE THAT EVERY ONE AROUND THEM IS SENDING OUT TO THE WORLD IF YOU THINK THAT'S KIND OF CRAZY A BUT I GESS THEY WANT TO CAPTURE THAT YUNIQUE EXPERIENCE YE BUT A IT'S NOT UNIQUE AT ALL THAT'S THE THAT'S THE MYTH THAT'S THE ILLUSION THERE'S NOTHING UNIQUE ABOUT THE YOUR POST OF SOMETHING THAT YOU WENT TO GO SEE WHAT WOULD BE TRULY UNIQUE AST A JUST EXPERIENCE THAT AND REA NON YI ITS SO WILD TO THINK ABOUT LIKE WHAT WE THINK OF AS U OUR UNIQUE PORTAL IS ACTUALLY NOT UNIQUE AT ALL IT'S WHAT WE DO WITH IT LEARN WHAT MIGT MY STANCES GLEAN AND LEARN INFORMATION ON LINE THAN GO USE IT IN REAL LIFE COME BACK FROM TIME TO TIME YOU KNOW MAY BE N OUR A DAY MAXIMUM ORE SO CAN I JUST UNDERSWARE THE TWO WORDS YOU SAID REAL LIFE CAUSE THAT IS THING IS A REALLY IMPORTANT KEY HERE WHICH IS THAT ALL IF REAL LIFE ISN'T HAPPENING ON SOCIAL MEDIAT THERE'S A WHOLE WORLD OUT THERE WHICH I THINK IS REAL LIFE WHICH IS HAPPENING OFF LINE AND WHAT'S HAPPENING ON LINE TOO OFTEN IS DISTORTED RIGHT IT'S GIVING US LIKE LIKE EVEN JUST TAKE ONM YOUNO JUST TAKE THE IMAGES THAT THAT WE SEE OF PEOPLE THERE A THE KNOWTHER SUMMER BEACH IMMAGES THERE  LIKE GREAT VACATION IMAGES THAT'S NON REPRESENTATIVE OF THEIR ENTIRE LIFE HOW THEIR LIVING THEIR LIFE THUT WE SEE THAT WE SEE PEOPLE'S ANGER WE AND THEIR VITORY ALL AND WE COME TO BELIEVE OVER TIME THAT THAT'S HOW PEOPLE FEEL THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE DEALING WITH AN EXPERIENCING THEIR LIFE AND AND WE'VE JUST GOT TO GET YOU KOW YOUR MAMA I LOVE WHAT YOU'RE OB DID OF GETTING YOUR GUIES OUTSIDE IM MY PARENTS DID THE SAME THING TOO LIKE WE WAS VERY BLESSE TO HAVE TWO PARENTS WHO DIDN'T CO YOU KNOW THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF RESOURCES WORING OPTAYIN' O TO THIS COUNTRY WITH A LOTT OF RESOURCES BUT THE ONE OF THE GREATEST GIFTS THEY GIVE  GAVE US IS THAT THEY LOVED US UNCONDITIONALLY THE OTHER GREAT GIFT THAT THEY GAVE US IS THEY PUSHED US TO JUST EXPLORE TO MEET PEOPLE TO LEARN ABOUT THE WORLD THEY WANTED US OUTSIDE PLAYING YOU KNOW EXPERIMENTING JUST THEDISCOVERING THE WORLD YOU KNOW WRITING OUR BIKE ROUND THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID BUT RIGHT NOW  TWO CRITICAL THINGS THAT KIDS NEED FOR TEIR METAL HEALP AND DEVELOPMENT ARE TWO IMPORTANT FORCES I SHOULD SAY THAT ARE IMPACTING THEIR METAL HEALP AND DEVELOPMENT ONE IS SOCIAL MEDIAUM BUT THE SECOND ALSO IS THE LACK OF ON STRUCTURED PLATON ITHAT KIDS HAF LIKE ONSTRUCTURED PLAYTIME IS TIME WHEN WE IS KIDS LEARN HOW TO NEGOTIATE SITUATIONS WITH OTHER KIDS HAD A RESOLVE CONFLICT HAD A RECOGNIZE WHAT'S GOING ON IN SOME ONE ELSE IS I KNOW EYES BEFORE THEY SAY SOMETHING WE LEARN HOW TO COLLABORATE AND PLAY AN WITH OTHER KITS IS A LOT YOU LEARN ON THE PLAYGROUND IT AS IT TURNS OUT BUT I WORRY THAT RIGHT NOW THAT WE'VE ALMOST SOMEHOW MADE THAT KIND OF INSTRUCTURE TIME SEEM INEFFICIENT YOU KNOW WE'VE SET THESE STANDARDS A FOR OUR KIDS THAT THEY NEED TO BE YOU KNOW GETTING FANCY JOBS AND INTO FANCY COLLEGES AND MAKIN AXAM OUNT OF MONEY AN TO PAT TO DOING THAT IS YOU KNOW TO BE ENROLLED IN EX TUMBER OF ACTIVITIES AFTER SCHOOL AND TO DO ALL TO SUFFAIN SCHOOL AND THEIR LIVES ARE SO HIPER STRUCTURED I THAT I WORRY THAT THE TIME TO JUST PLAY TO BE CREATED TO REFLECT AND THINK TO JUST HAVE ON STRUCTURE TIME WITH OTHER KIDS HAS EVAPORATED AND I THINK OT THAT ALSO IS HURTING THEM AT A HOP AND WELL BEING OF OUR CHILDREN I LOVE THE IDEA THAT THAT UNSTRUCTURE PLAY TIME COULD BE FRAMED IN THE ACCURATE CONTET OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM DEVELOPING THE WAY IT WAS SUPPOSED TO DEVELOP MN I WOULD ARGUE THAT UM SUCCESS IS GOING TO BE EASIEST FOR CHILDREN THAT ENGAGE IN THE REAL WORLD MORE I FACT THERE'S GREAT RISK TO POSTING EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO ON LINE WE'VE SEEN SOME EXAMPLES OF THAT PREVENTING PEOPLE FROM S GETTING INTO OUR STAYING IN COLLEGE BASED ON THINGS THEY SAID OR DID PREVIOUSLY THAT THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID OR DONE UM THAT'S WHAT DOSAR KIND OF YOU KNOW NEGATIVE HIGH LIGHTED CASES BUT IN GENERAL UM WE KNOW THAT THAT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THRIVES ON DIVERSITY VE TYPES OF INTERACTIONS AND SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AND PARTICULAR I'M JUST RESTATING WHAT YOU JUST SAID SO IF EVER THERE WAS A CALL FOR GIDS TO GET OUT INTO NONSCREEN LIFE LET'S HELL IT UM AN ENGAGE ATHEIR NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT WAY IT WITHOUT QUESTION IS GOING TO BENEFIT THEM IN TERMS OF THEIR ABILITY TO LEARN IND RETAIN INFORMATION PERFORM WELL IN SCHOOL WHICH IS NOT EVERYTHING LIFES ABOUT BUT LET'S FACE IT WE STILL LIVE IN A SOCIETY WHERE HITTING THOSE MILESTONES ON A CONSISTENT BASIS OR THE BEST IS THE BEST PREDICTOR OF PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO YOU NON LIVE SELF SUSTAIN LIVES BUILT FAMILIES AND THAT SORT OF THING SO UM YOU MENTIOND A FEW ACTIONABLE  ITEMS FOR PARENTS AS IT RELATES TO KIDS MAYBE WELL NOT MAYBE LIMITS THEIR SCREEN TIME FORCE THEM OUTSIDE IN THE SAFE WEATHER AND SAFE CONDITIONS OF COURSE BUT WHAT ABOUT ADULTS AS WELL A D WHAT WHAT CAN WE ALL DO SHOULD WE BE RESTRICTING OUR SCREENE TIME T EX NUMBER OF HOURS PER DAY YOU'RE THE SURGEON GENERAL IF YOU HAD A MAGIC WAND WHICH I REALIZE YOU DON'T AM AND YOU COULD MAKE A A A HIGHLY INFORMED RECOMMENDATION ABOUT WHAT THE THRESHOLDS FOR TOO MUCH A TIME ON SOCIAL MEDIA AR UM BUT WERE TO BE TO HOURS THREE HOURS YES IT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND LET ME AS SHOU GO THROUGH SOME OF THESE THINGS OF PARENTS CAN CAN DO FOR KIDS IN THAT WE CAN ALL DO FOR OURSELVES WITH KIDS IN PARTICULAR WHAT I WOULD DO SPECIVILY WITH SOCIAL MEDIA IS AND THIS IS IS IS FRANKLY WHAT I AM PLANNING TO DO WITH MY WIFE FOR OUR KITS AS THEY GROW UP NEMBER ONE I WOULD SEEK TO DELAY THAT USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA PAST MIDDLE SCHOOL AT ATMIN AMUM AND I KNOW THAT THAT IS HARD TO DO AT A TIME WHEN ALL KIDS ARE ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND YOU DO'T WANT YOUR CHILD TO BE THE ONLY WHEN LEFT OUT AND TO BE LONELY IS A RESULT SO THAT MEANS NO ACCOUNT OF THEIR OWN MEANS NO ACCOUNT OF THEIR OWN AND I WOULD MAKE SEE TO THE BESTY OF YOUR ABILITY SEE IF THEIR OTHER PARENTS THAT YOU CAN PARTNER WITH TO DO THIS BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO DO ALONE AS A PARENT BUT IT'S ALSO IF THERE ARE OTHER PARENTS YOUR PARTNERING WITH THAT MEANS YOUR OTHER KIDS WHO ARE ALSO DELAYING YOU SOE MEANS YOUR CHILD IS NOT ALONE AND I THINK IF YOU START THE CONVERSATION WITH OTHER PARENTS WHO'LL REALIZE A LOT OF THEM ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE SAME THINGS YOU ARE THEY MAY HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT DELAYING YOUE BUT THEY ALSO DON'T WANT THEIR KID TO BE THE ONLY ONES THIS BECOMES A NUMBEROUS CHALLENGE BUT PARTNERSHIP CAN HELP US IF YOUR CHILDS ALREADY ON SOCIAL MEDIA WHUT ID RECOMMEND IS TO CREATE SACRED SPACES IND THEIR LIVES THAT OR TECNOLOGY FREE AND SPECIFICALLY I WOULD THINK ABOUT THE HOUR BEFORE BEDTIME AND THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT AS TIME THAT YOU WANT TO PROTECT THIS KIDS ARE LOSING NOT JUST SLEEP BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO SLEEP LATER CAUSE THY'RE ON THEIR DEVICES BU THEY ALSO WAKING UP IN THE MILL OF THE NIGHT AYBE YO USE A BATHRO MAYBE TO GET SOME WATER AND THEN THOY GET BACK ON THEIR DEVICES AGAIN SO THE QUALITY OF THEIR SLEEP IS BEING SIGNIFINTLY IMPACTED BY ACCESS TOF THOSE DEVICES TER IN THE NIGHT SO I WOULD PROTECT THAT TIME HOUR BEFORE BED THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT I WOULD ALSO CREATE MAKE SURE MEAL TIMES WERE TECK FREE'SOWN SO THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY THAT YOU TALK TO ONE ANOTHER YOU SEE ONE ANOTHER AND TIME WITH FRIENDS AN FAMILY MEMBERS WHEN YOU'RE OUT YOU KNOW AT A BIRTHDAY PARTY ET CETERA HAN THAT TECT FREETIME LET THEM FOCUS ON THEIR TIME WITH OTHER PEOPLE THOSE THREE TACK FREE'SOWNS CAN DO A WORLD OF GOOD I TO HELP YOUR CHILD AND IN THE LAST THING I'D RECOMMEND HERE OF THE MANY THINGS ITHINK PARENCE COULD DO ITS TO START A DIALOGUE WITH YOUR CHILD ABOUT THEI'RE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA WE DON'T ALWAYS KNOW HOW SOCIAL ME IS MAKING OUR KITS FEEL I FROM THE IND AND WE MAY REALIZE WHEN WE TALK TO THEM THAT THEY ASHALLY HAVETEIR OWN CONCERNS THEY MIGHT SAY ATS NOT MAKING ME FEEL REALLY GOOD BUT IT'S JUS LIKE HARD NOT TO BE ON IT EF WHEN'S LIKE TEXTING ON THIS ER EVERONE IS A YOU KNOW EVERYINE'S YOU NOR SHARING INFORMATION AND POSTING PICTURES ON I FEEK I NEED TO BE ON IT YOU CAN ONLY HELP THEM START TO MANAGE THAT IF YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S A CHALLENGE AT THEIR HAVING SO OPENY A CONVERSATIONS SO YOUR CHILD KNOWS THAT YOU'R NOT JUDGING THEM BUT YOU'RE TRUN TO UNDERSTAND THEIR EXPERIENCE IS IMPORTANT ALSO SO YOU CAN HELP THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR THEM TO EXPERIENCE ON SOCIAL MEDIA THEY'RE BEING HORASSTER BILL LEAD BY STRANGERS I THAT IS A PROBLEM YOU WANT YOUR CHILD IT'S O TO TELL YOU ABOUT THAT TO REPORT THAT I'M IF THEY SEE SOMETHING POSTED ON LINE THAT'S REALLY CONCERNING TO THEM LET'S SAY THEY SEE A FRIEND POST THAT THEY'RE THINKING OF TAKING THEIR OWN LIFE FOR HARMING THEMSELF IN ANOTHER WAY YOU WANT THEM TO NOTE THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT TO FLAG AND TO GET HELP YOU KNOW THATHEY SHOULDN'T JUST YOU KNOW SQUIRREL PAST THAT SO THAT CONVERSATION IS REALLY IMPORTANTAND FINALLY HIS PARENTS WE CAN LEAD BY EXAMPLE RIGHT AND THIS IS HARD CAUSE THE TRUTH IS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SOCIAL METINGAN YOUTH AND THAT'S THE SUBJECT OF MY SERGEON GENERALS ADVISORY WAS ON BUTI HAVE CONCERNS AN ADULTS TOO I SAY IT O SOMEBODY WHO HAD CHALLENGES IN MY OWN USE YOU KNOW  OF SOCIAL MEDIA FINDING SOMETIMES THAT  BLEED SILL YO KNOW PAST MY BEDTIME AND I'M REALIZED YOU KNOW I THING I MAN Y CHECK SOMETHING FOR FIVE MINUTES AN HOUR LATER I'M STILL THERE YOU KNOW SCROLLING THROUGH SOMETHING AND SOMETIMES I YOU KNOW YOU KNOW I FIND MYSELF I HAVE OVER THE YEARS I FOUND MYSELF COMPARING MYSELF ALSO I TO POSTS I SEE ON LINE IN UNHEALTHY WAYS SOMETIMES I FIND MYSELF AM SOD AVE PULLED INTO A CONTENT A THAT YOU KNOW ENDS AT BEING ANGRY AND BITRIALA CAN LEAVES ME FEELING WORSE YOU KNOW AT THE END SO I'VE EXPERIENCED THIS AS WELL AND A THESE PARENTS ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS TO DO IS TO FALL THIS ADVICE FOR GIVING OUR KIDS TO DRAW THOSE BOUNDARIES AS WELL AND TO PUT OUR DEVICES AWAY WHEN WE'RE ROUND OR A KIDS AONE EXPERIENCE I HAD WHICH SHOULD HAVE I STILL FEEL BOUT ABOUT BUT WHICH REALLY HELP KIND OF KNOCK SOME SENSE INTO ME WAS AFTER MY MY SON WAS BORN A MY OLDER CHILD I WAS IK SHLLY I WAS SEARGEON GENTRLE AT THAT TIME YOU KNOW I HAD YOU KNOW RELAGENON WAS BUSY JOB ET CETERA BUT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I PROTECTED BEDTIMES AND MEAL TIMES FOR US TO BE TOGETHER AS A FAMILY YET ONE DAY WHEN I CAME HOME YOU KNW AFTER DINNER WHEN WE WERE IN THE BATTIME AN A BEDTIME ROUTINE TO GET MY  ON READY A FOR THE NIGHT  MY WIFE WAS CHANGING HIS DIPER AND INSTEAD OF HELPING I WAS JUST SANDING AT THE SIDE SCROLLING THROUGH MY INBOX AND MY WIFE WHO HAS INFINITE PATIENCE AND IS LIKE ONE OF THE MOST WELL  JUST TO PEOPLE THAT I KNOW JUST PAUSED AND SHE TURN TO ME AN ALICE SAID DO YOU REALLY NEED TO BE DOING THAT RIGHT KNOW AND SHE SAID JUST VERY QUIETLY BUT I FELT TIS  SUCH A SENSE OF SHAME WHEN SHE DID THI CAUSE WAS LIKE WHAT AM I DOING LIKE THIS IS MY INFINIT CHILD YOU KNOW AND THE RARE FEW HOURS I HAVE WITH HIM DURING THE DAY AND I'M JUST SWORN THROUGH MY INBOX MY PHONE LIKE LIKE THIS IS TERRIBLE AND LOOK I KNOW THAT ALL OF US DO THIS IT MAY BE IFFERENT CONTACTS BUT I WAS A AWAKE UP MOMENT FOR ME CAUSE I REALIZE TIK ONE LIKE AS YOU KNOW WELL AS A NUR SCINTIS WE CAN'T REALLY MULTY TASK RI WE'RE RAPIDLY TASKS WITCHING RIGHT AND NOT WAYS TIME IN MI WEN I AHEAD WAS IN MY INBOX THAND MY HEAD WASNT WITH HIM YOU KNOW N MY HEART WASN'T WITH HIM RIGHT I WAS JUST DISTRACTED AND SO AS PARENTS IF WE CAN HONOR THOSE SACRED TIMES YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE WITH OUR CHILDREN TO KEEP OUR DEVICES AWAY MEAL TIMES SLEEP TIME AS WELL IT'S NOT EASY TO DO BUT IT REALLY SETS A GOOD EXAMPLE FOR OUR KIDS IM ALL BEHAVIOUR CHANGE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE THE KIND OF BEHAVOUR CHANGED I'VE WORKED WITH THE PATIENTS OVER THE YEARS ARE IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND DIET ALL THIS IS HARDER TO DO WHEN WE'RE DOING IT BY OURSELF IT'S A LOT EASIER TO DO WHEN WE'RE WE HAVE A COUPLE OF FRIENDS OR FAMILY MEMBERS WE AGREE TO DO THIS WITH WE HOLD EACH OTHER ACCOUNTABLE WE ENCOURAGE AND SUPPORT EACH OTHER IM IT'S HOW I'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL BEHAVIOUR CHANGES I'VE MADE IN MY LIFE HAVE COME ABOUT BECAUSE I HAVE TWO GOOD BUDDIES A DAVAN SUNNY WHO ARE MY MY PART OF MY BROTHERHOOD AND THE THREE OF US IS BROTHERS TALK ABOUT HEALTH WE TALK ABOUT OUR FINANCES WE TALK ABOUT OUR FAMILY IN OUR FRIENDSHIPS AND OUR FAILINGS AND WE HELP KEEP EACH OTHER ACCOUNTABLE AND IT'SO IWU JUST ENCOURAGE PARENTS LIKE IS TO SAY A SOUNDS DAUNTING OR OVERWHELMING YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS ALONE THINK ABOUT ONE OR TWO PEOPLE OTHER PARENTS YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO THIS WITH AND I CARING TOYOU THERE LOT OF US A STRUGGLE ITH THE SAMESTUFF AND THEY WOULD POBABLY WELCOME AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THIS IN COLLOBORATION WITH ANOTHER PARENT SUCH SPECTACULAR ADVICE THAT I HOPE EVERY ONE WILL FOLLOW NOT JUST FOR THEIR KIDS BUT FOR THEMSELVES I THINK THAT WHETHEROR NOT A SOCIAL MEDYIS A DICTIVE IN IN THE TRUE SENSE OF THE WORD IS IS KIND OF A MEANINGLESS DEBATE AT THIS POINT NOW IT'S AT THE VERY LEAST A A COMPULSIVE BEHAVIOUR FOR MANY OF US AND AS YOU DESCRIBED IT IN EXAMPLE YOU GAVE IT BECOMES REFLECTSIVE YES WE'RE JUST N WE'RE NOT A SIDELY SEEKING PLEASURE OR LOOKING TO TO ENGAGE IN ON LINE BATTLES IS JUST IT'S BECOME REFLECIVE SO LIKE FINDING YOURSELF WITH YOUR HAND IN THE REFRIGERATOR JUST EVEN THINK ABOUT IT YEIS DOING IT SO BECOMING MORE CONSCIOUS OF THE USE A AND THEREBY MORE CONSCIOUS OF THE VALUE OF PUTTING AWAY THE SCREENS AND SOCIAL MEDIAM FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME EACH DAY AND CERTAINLY IN THE MIDDLE THE NIGHT FOLKS NERL PLASTICITY BRAIN REQIRING HAPPENS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WHILE YOU'RE ASLEEP AND I THIS WHEN YOU MENTION KIDS AWAKEIN MHEL THE NIGHT LAOTHEIR PONE I JUST I THOUGHT YOU HAVE IND O MI NE NO AS A IT AINS ME AND LOK I'VE LOOK AT MY PHONE IN THEMILL THE NIGHT I TRY NOT TO BUT UM BUT I'M CERTAINLY NOT IN THE WINDOW OF MAXIMUM PLASTICITY EITHER IT'S TERRIBLE FOR EVERYBODY BUT ESPECIALLY TERRIBLE FOR KIDS AM WHAT YOU JUST PROVIDED IT IS AN INCREDIBLE LET'S JUST CALL IT A I'LL CALL IT A MAN THEY YOU DIDN'T SAY IT BUT A SUGGESTION OF OF TEEMING UP WITH PEOPLE I'M TO BECOME MORE LIKE MINDED AROUND THESE ISSUES AND TO REALLY PROMOTE HEALTH ALONG THOSE LINES I I REALLY WANT O THANK YOU UM FIRST OF ALL FOR THE CONVERSATION TO DAY YOU'RE INCREDIBLY BUSY YOURE RESPONSIBLE FOR AAN ENTIRE COUNTRY IS WORTH OF A PEOPLE SO TO TAKE TIME TO SIT DOWN WITH ME AND TO DISCUSS THESE TOPICS FOR OUR AUDIENCES IT INCREDIBLY APPRECIATED BY ME AND   BY THEM I I FEEL COMFORTABLE EXTENDING THEIR GRATITUDE HERE AND IT'S ALSO CLEAR BASED ON TO DAY'S CONVERSATION THAT YOU FACE AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF CHALLENGES AT THE LEVEL OF BUGUTARY CHALENGES BY THE WAY OF IN O WORK ON THAT UM IS HARD TO SHUT ME UP UM AS WELL AS THE THE HUGE ARRAY OF OF ISSUES THAT YOU CONFRONT AND U AND IT'S CLEAR THAT IT'S A CHALLEGE THAT YOU'VE EMBRACED FOR MANY YEARS NOW HUNDRED DIFFICULT CONDITIONS AND THAT YOU'RE CLEARLY WILLING TO GET OUT AND TALK TO PEOPLE AND HERE THEIR CRITICISM HERE THEIR CONCERNS HERE UM AND LEARN FROM THEM AND SO IT'S BEEN OF GREAT BENEFIT TOUS TO HERE AND LEARN FROM Y O AND I HOPE THIS WON'T BE THE THE LAST OF OUR CONVERSATIONS THERE'S MANY MORE TOPICS TO COVER BUT JUST REALLY ONE TO THANK YOU THANKS EVER SO MUCH FOR THE THE THE INTELLECTUAL POWER AND THE EMOTIONAL POWER THAT YOU PUT INTO WHAT YOU DO CAUSE THAT IS VERY CLEAR YOU'RE A PHYSICIAN FIRST AND YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR PATIENTS AND YOUR PATIENTS ARE ALL OF US SO THANK YOU SO MUCH ANDOU THATS FORSTRANGE IS INCREDIBLE KIND OF YOU I THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT AND I HAVE LOVED OUR CONVERSATION AND YOU NOW FOR ME WHAT WHAT I HOPE MOST OF ALL FOR MI KIS FOR OUR COUNTRY MORE BROADLY IS THAT IS IT WE CAN GO DEEPER LIKE BENEATH TH I THESE SURFACE ISSUES I'VE WORRIED THAT WE FIND OURSELVES DISAGREEING ABOUT IN FIGHTING ABOUT ON LYING AND RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A DEEPER CHALLENGE THAT WE ARE FACING THAT I THINK UNDERLIES A LOT OF THESE THE ANGER IN THE VITRIOL AND THIS ISSUE AROUND HOW DISCONNECTED WE BECOME FROM ONE ANOTHER I THINK E'S AT THE HEART OF THAT I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S ANY POLICY OR PROGRAMME WE CAN IMPLEMENT THAT'S CON ULTIMATELY FIX WHAT AL SOCIETY WITHOUT FUNDAMENTALLY REALIZING THAT A LOT OF THIS IS A MANIFESTATION OF A SOCIETY THAT HAS BECOME MORE DISCONNECTED AND MORE DISINVESTED IN ONE ANOTHER IGO FOR TIME AND THAT'S JUST NOT WHO WE ARE IT'S NOT HOW WE HAVE ALLED OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS INDS NOT HOW REGANETTE THRIVE IN THE FUTURE SO I KNOW THAT SOMETIMES WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE BIG INTRACTABLE PROBLEMS I LIKE WIDESPREAD LONELINESS IN THE UNITED STATES THAT IT CAN SEEM LIKE HARD TO ADDRESS THESE BUT I DO WANT TO ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO TO RECOGNIZE IT WHEN IT COMES TO HUMAN CONNECTION THAT IT IS SMALL STEPS THAT CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE BECAUSE WE ARE HARD WIRE TO CONNECT IS HUMAN BEINGS AND IF YOU  YOU JUST PAUSE FOR A MOMENT AND IF YOU JUST THINK FOR A MOMENT IN YOUR OWN LIFE ABOUT IS SOME ONE WHO HAS BEEN THERE FOR YOU DURING A TIME OF GREAT NEED SOMEBODY WHO HAS STOOD UP FOR YOU AND YOU COULDN'T STAND UP FOR YOURSELF SOME ONE WHO'S HELP TO REMINDS YOU WHY YOU'RE SILLA GOOD PERSON WHY YOU STILL HAVE WORTH AND VALUE TO ADD TO THE WORLD EVEN WHEN YOU HAD LOST FAITH IN YOURSELF YOU THINK ABOUT THEIR FAITH IN YOU ABOUT THEIR SUPPORT FOR YOU ABOUT THEIR LOVE FOR YOU THINK THAT HOW HEALING THAT WAS THAT'S THE POWER THAT WE HAVE TO HELP EACH OTHER HEEL WE ARE GOING THROUGH AN IDENTITY CRISIS IN MANY WAYS AS A COUNTRY WERE I THINK WE NEEN TO ASK OURSELVES WHO ARE WE LIKE WHAT DEFINDS WHO WE ARE WHAT ARE THE SET OF VALUES THAT WE WANT TO GUIDE US IN OUR LIFE AND TO GUIDE OUR COUNTRY AND I KNOW THAT IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE A NATION OF PEOPLE WHO ARE MEAN WHO ONLY CARE ABOUT OURSELVES WE'RE THROWING BLAME AND ANGER AT EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME WHO ARE PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE BUT I SHALLY DON'T THINK THAT'S REALLY WHO WE ARE I THINK AT OUR HEART WE ARE HOPEFUL AND OPTIMISTIC PEOPLE I THINK IN OUR TRUE NATURE WE ARE KIND AND GENEROUS TO ONE ANOTHER UM IN OUR HEARTS WE WE WE'RE INTERDEPENDENT CREATURES WHO RECOGNIZED THAT IF SOMEONE ELSE IS SUFFERING WE WANT TO BE OUT THERE TO SUPPORT THEM A AND WHO WANTED WHANT PEOPLE TO BE THERE TO SUPPORT US AS WELL THAT'S WHO WE REALLY ARE BUT WE HAVE TO TO MAKE A CLEAR CHOICE HERE ABOUT OURE IDENTITY YOU KNOW AS AS INDIVIDUALS AND AS A COUNTRY AND RECOGNIZED THAT THAT CHOICE HAS REAL IMPLICATIONS FOR EVERYTHING ELSEHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE THAT'S THE FOUNDATION AND WHEN I THINK ABOUT MY OWN KIDS AVE GROWN UP LIKE LIKE MANY PARENTS I WORRY ABOUT THE WORLD THAT THEIR COMING INTO UM I I WORRY THAT THEREGIN A USE THE WRONG WORD EVEN THOUGH THEIR INTENT IONS ARE RIGHT AND PEOPLE ARE GENANG BLAME THEM OR CAST THEM OUT UKNOW I WORRY THAT THEY'RE IN A STUMBLE AND FALL DOWN AND THE WHICH TND KEEP WALCOME BY NOT CARING YOU KNOW BECAUSE EV ONE'S LIVE IN THEIR OWN LIFE I WORRY THAT THEY MIGHT BECOME A SOMEONE WHO DOES THE SAME THING TO OTHER PEOPLE RIGHT NONE OF WHICH I WANT WHUT I WANT FOR ALL OF OUR KIDS IS FOR THEM TO GROW UP IN A SOCIETY WHERE WE CARE ABOUT ONE ANOTHER WE HAVE EACH OTHERS BACKS WE RECOGNIZE AS THAT OLD AFRICAN PROVERB GOES THAT WE CAN GO FAST IF WE GO ALONE BUT IF WE REALLY ONE OF AFAR WE GO TOGETHER DTHAT'S WHAT I WANT FOR MY KIDS IN OUR COUNTRY BUT THAT'S WHAT WE EACH HAVE THE POWER TO CREATE IN OUR OWN LIVES IT STARTS WIT THE DECISIONS WE MAKE BUT HOW WE TREAT ONE ANOTHER DO WE FOR EXAMPLE WEACH OUT FOR FIVE MINUTES A DAY TO SOMEONE THAT WE CARE ABOUT DO WE PICK UP THE PHONE AND CALL THEM TO SAY HAY I'M THINKING ABOUT YOU WE CAN ALL DO THAT TO DAY DO WE GIVE PEOPLE THE BENEFIT OF OUR FULL ATTENTION RECOGNIZING THAT WHILE TIME IS SCARCE OUR ATTENTION HAS THE ABILITY TO STRETCH TIME THEY CAN MAKE FIVE MINUTES FEEL LIKE HALF AN HOUR UT IT'S A HARD THING FOR PEOPLE TO GET AUS TEY'RE DISTRACTED ABY THEIR DEVICES BUT DO WE GIVE PEOPLE THE BENEFIT OF OUR FULL ATTENTION AND DO WE LOOK FOR WAYS TO SERVE ONE ANOTHER RECOGNIZING THAT'S THROUGH OUR ACTS OF SERVICE THAT WE ACTUALLY FORGE POWERFUL CONNECTIONS BUT WE ALSO REMIND OURSELVES HOW MUCH VALUE WE HAVE TO BRING TO THE WORLD THIS IS IMPORTANT IN A TIME WHEN THE SELF ESTEEM SO MANY OF US AND OUR YOUNG PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR IS BEING YE WROTE IT NOT PARTICULARLY BY THEIR USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA SO THESE ARE THE STEPS THAT WE CAN TAKE TO BUILD CONNECTION IN OUR LIFE BUT THE CORP VALUES I BELIEVE THAT HAVE TO BE AT THE HEART OF OUR IDENTITY THESE VALUES ARE UND KINDNESS IN GENEROSITY AROUND COURAGE AND SERVICE THESE ALSO HAVE TO ANIMATE THE DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE IN OUR LIFE ABOUT PROGRAMMS WE ADVOCATE FOR THE POLICIES WE SUPPORT THE LEADERS WE CHOOSE THEY SHOULD ALL BE REFLECTIONS OF THE VALUES THAT WE WANT A SEE IN OUR CHILDREN AND SOCIETY MORE BROADLY CAUSE I'LL TELL YOU THAT NINETY PER CENT A PLOS OF THE DECISIONS LEADERS MAKE THEY MAKE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS AND WHAT'S GUIDING THEM IN THOSE MOMENTS ARE THEIR VALUES THAT'S TRUE WHETHER YOU'RE THE LEADER OF A COMPANY OR NOT PROFIT ORGANIZATION OR LEADER IN GOVERNMENT SO THOSE VALUES MATTER AND I WANT US IS A COUNTRY TO SPEAK MORE ABOUT THE VALUES THAT WE CHOOSE ABOUT THE IDENTITY THAT WE WANT TO ANCOR OURSELVES TO THAT'S THE WAY IN WHICH I FEEL LIKE AMERICA CAN BE AN EVEN GREATER BEACON OF HOPE FOR THE WORLD BECAUSE THE WORLD IS STRUGGLING WITH THIS TOO WE'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES WHO ARE DEALING WITH LONELINESS AND ISOLATION WERE SEEING ANGER AAND RESENTMENT ANVITRY ALL BUBBLE UP A HAT EXTRAORDINARY LEVELS WHO ARE SEEING MISTRUST AND INSTITUTIONS SORE MANY COUNTRIES ARE EXPERIENCING THIS I WOULD LOVE AMERICA TO LEAD THE WAY IN SOME WAYS AND SHOWING WHAT IT'S LIKE TO EMBRACE SO MORE HUMAN IDENTITY THAT CENTERED OR ON KINDNESS AND SERVICE AND FRIENDSHIP AND GENEROSITY LIKE TO ME ALL OF THESE VALUES ULTIMATELY ANDREWS STEM FROM LOVE Y LOVE IS OUR GREATEST SOURCE OF POWER IT'S OUR GREATES SOURCE OF HEALING I SEE THAT AS THE DOCTORS PRESCRIBE MANY MEDICINES OVER THE YEARS BUT THEIR FEW THINGS MORE POWERFUL THAN LOVE IN IT'S ABILITY TO HELP US THROUGH DIFFICULT TIMES AND HELP MEN THE WOUNDS SEEN AND UNSEEN A THAT WE ALL CARRY WITH US AND I THINK IF WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE RECOGNIZED TAID YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE AN EMDY AFTER OUR NAME ORE GONE TO NURSING SCHOOL TO BE HEALERS WE ALL HAVE THE POWER TO HELPE EACH OTHER HEAL LIKE ANDREW WE ARE NOT FUNDAMENTALLY A NATION OF BYSTANDERS WE JUST STAND BY WHILE OTHER PEOPLE SUFFER LIKE WE'RE NATION OF OF HEALERS AND HOPE MAKERS WHO CAN RESTORE HOPE THAT THE FUTURE CAN BE BETTER WHO CAN CREATE A BETTER LIFE FOR OURSELVES IN THE PEOPLE AROUND JUS RIGHT NOW IT'S WA WE'RE CAPABLE OF IT'S WHAT WE'RE BUILT FOR THAT' SEEM ANDANITY THAT I

WELCOME TO THE HUBERMIN LAD GUEST SERIENS WHERE I AND AN EXPERT GUEST IS GA SCIENCE IN SCIENCE PACE TO S RI MA YOUR HUBERMEN AND OM OUR PROFESSOR OF NEUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHOMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY'S EPISODE IS THE THIRD IN THE SIX EPISODE SERIES ON FITNESS EXERCISE AND PERFORMANCE TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALL ABOUT ENDURANCE AND FAT LOSS THAT IS THE SPECIFIC PROTOR CALLS REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE THE FOUR DIFFERENT KINDS OF ENDURANCE AND HOW TO MAXIMIZE FAT LOSS DOCTOR AND TO YALOPAN GRAY TO BE BACK TO DAY WE'RE GING TO TALK ABOUT ENDURANCE AND I'M VERY INTERESTED IN THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE I LIKE MANY OTHER PEOPLE STRIVE TO GET A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CARTVASCULAR WORK IN EACH WEEK MAYBE A LONG ISSJOG MAY BE A SWIM RITE THE BODY ET CETERA BUT WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE WORD ENDURANCE THE IDEA THAT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY COMES TO MIND IS ABOUT DOING SOMETHING FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME REPEATEDLY BUT I HAVE A FEELING THAT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO TRIGGER THIS ADAPTATION THAT WE CALL THE ENDURANCE ADAPTATION I'M EXCITED TO LEARN ABOUT THAT I'M ALSO EXCITE TO LEARN ABOUT THE FUEL SYSTEMS IN THE BODY THAT ALLOW FOR ENDURANCE AN OTHER MODES OF REPEATED ACTIVITY OH IN ORDER TO KEEP THINGS OFF IT LETFR YOU TO FRAME THE CONVERSATION BY TELLING US WHAT IS ENDURANCE AND ARE THERE INDEED A LARGE VARIETY OF WAYS TO INDUCE WHAT WE CALL THIS ENDURANCE ADAPTATION SURE THE WHERE WANTO START ACTUALLY HERE IS IS CALLING BACK TO SOME THE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT OUR PREVIOUS CONVERSATIONS WHICH ARE REALLY PEOPLE H EXERCISE FOR THREE REASONS NUMBER WANT YOU WANT TA FEEL BETTER NUMBER TWO YOU WANT TA LOOK A CERTAIN WAY AND HE UMER THREE YOU WANT TO BEABLE TO DO THAT FOR A LONG TIME RIGHTS YOU NEED THE WAY THAT WE SAY SPORTS IS LITTLE GOOD FEEL GOOD PLAGUOT SO I WANT SOME SORT OF FUNCTIONALITY TO BUILD A PERFORM A CERTAIN WAY WHATEVER THAT IS FOR YOU YOU WANT TO BE ABLE LOOK A CERTAIN WAY THAT WHATEVER THAT MATTERS FOR YOU N THN YOU WANT TA BLE TO DO THAT FOR A LONG TIME SO WHE IT COME TO ENDURANCE WE HAVE A BUNCH OF MISSNO MERSE HERE WHICH IS THE SAME THING WITH THE STRENGTH TRAINING OF RESISTANCE EXERCISE CIDE WEWERE WE WANTED TO DISPEL THI MITH THAT I LIFT WAITS ONLY BECAUSE I I WANT TO GAIN MUSCLE OR PLAY A SPORT AND I WANT TO DO CARDIO BECAUSE I WANT TO LEITHER LOOSE FAT OR FOR LONG HEALTH SEK AND JUST LIKE WE SMASH THAT MITH FROM THE STRENGTH RING SIDE I' WNT U SMASH FROM THE ENDURANCE TRAINING SIDE THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER REASONS THAT YOU WANT TO PERFORM ENDURANCE TRAINING REGARDLESS OF YOUR GOAL RIGHT WHETHER IT IS LONGGEVITY WHETHER TOES PERFORMANCE OR WHETHER IT IS ASTETICS AND SO WEREGN OT I WANT TA COVER ALL THOSE REASONS A EXACTLY WHAT TO DO A PROTOCALLS OF COURSE AND WHY THOSE THINGS ARE WORKING THAT WAY IN GENERAL THOUGH THE QUICK ANSWER IS REALLY ENDURANCE COMES DOWN TO TWO INDEPENDENT FACTORS FACTOR NUMBER ONE IS FATIGUE MANAGEMENT AN IN FACTOR NUMBER TWO IS FUELING AND THAT'S ALL TIT REALLY COMES DOWN TO SO ALL THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF TRAINING ARE GOING TO REACH A LIMITATION WHICH ARE EITHER AGAIN YOUR ABILITY TO DEAL WITH SOME SORT OF FATIGUE AN THAT'S GENERALLY A FATIGUE SIGNAL THE OTHER ONE IS MANAGING SOME SORT OF RESTRICTION OF ENERGY AND PUT AND A LOT THE POILER HERE IS A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE THINK IT'S A FUELING ISSUE AND REALLY IT'S A FATIGUE MANAGEMENT ISION OR THE OPPOSITE AND TO HAVE A COMPLETE HEALTH SPECTRUM REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOUR HIGH PERFORMANCE ATHLY LIKE I TYPICALLY DEAL WITH OR GENERAL PUBLIC YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO BOTH MAN ASE FATIGUE AS WELL AS UNDERSTAND FEEL STORGE SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT WERE GON TO GET INTO TODAY FANTASTIC I CAN'T WAIT BEFORE WE DIE THEN I'M GOING TO ASK YOU WHAT I OFTEN ASK PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERT IN THEIR RESPECTIVE FIELDS WHICH IS IS THERE ANY NON OBVIOUS TOOL OR MECHANISM OR TOAL END MECHANISM THAT CAN ALLOW PEOPLE TO ACCESS BETTER ENDURANCE YOU WHEN I THING ABOUT TRAINING FOR ENDURANCE AGAIN I THING ABOUT TRYING TO RUN LONGER AND LONGER EACH WEEK  OR SWIM FURTHER AND FURTHER AND SO ON BUT I DO WONDER WHETHER NOT THERE ARE OTHER FORMS OF TRAINING THAT CAN AMPLIFY THE ENDURANCE ADAPTATION THAT I OR MOST BE WON'T PERHAPS DON'T THINK OF AS ENDURANCE SHORT THE WHAL ON ANSWER THIS IS IF WE LOOK BACK AND THINK ABOUT HOW WE'VE ANSWER THAT QUESTION WITH POWER AND STRENGTH AND FORCE PRODUCTION IT IS REALLY ABOUT HOW MUCH CAN YOU PRODUCE MAXIMILY ONCE WHAT YOU'RE A'SKING NOW IS HOW CAN I REPEAT THAT SAME QUALITY OF PERFORMANCE IF THAT'S THE CASE EN DURANCE REALLY COMES DOWN TO YOUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN PROPER MECHANICS THAT'S GOING THAT THE BIGGEST WAY WE CAN AN INCREASE YOUR ENDURANCE EXPENENTIALLY VERY QUICKLY IS MECHANICAL AND THIS IS STARTING WITH BREATHING AND SO WE NEED TO BE BREATHING PROPERLY WE NEED TO HAVE PROPER POSTER AND POSITIONS AND THEN WE NEED TO BE MOVING WELL EFFICIENCY IS GOING TO TRUMP FORCE ALWAYS FOR ENDURANCE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE QUATION IS NOT THAT YOU CAN HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF LEAKS IN YOUR MECHANICS AND STILL SQUAT WELL OR JUMP HIGH AND BE FINE BECAUSE YOU N'T HAVE TO SUFFER THOSE CNSQUENCES REPEATEDLY RIHT THAT'S GOING TO DRAIN YOU OVER TIME SO A THE QUICKEST WAY TO IMPROVENURANCE IS TO AMD PROVE MECHANICS AND MECHANICAL THING OU' GO AFTER FIRST IS YOUR BREATHING TECHNIQUES YOUR PATTEN YOUR ENTIRE APPROACH AS WELL AS YOUR POSTURE AND THEN FROM THERE THE THIRD ONE WOULD BE YOUR MOVEMENT TECHNIC IS IT POSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE THE BEST WAY TO BREATHE WHEN DUING NDURANCE TRAINING OR IS IT FAR MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT AND IF IT IS FAR MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT THAN CERTAINLY WE CAN GET INTO IT DURING TO DAY'S EPISODE YET IT IS BOTH OF THOSE I WILL GIVE YOU QUICK ANSWER THOUGH A LOT OFOF TIMES YOU CAN COND OF HIT FACHITE COT WHICH IS NASAL BREAHNG THERE THERE'S PLENTY TIMES WHEN YOU DON'T WANT A NAISEL BREATHER DON'T NEED TO NEAS O REATH BUT JUST AGAIN IS THAT LIKE HE ONE TOOL THAT IS A FOR TA A PRETTY GENERAL ANSWER IF YOU CAN DO THAT A LOT O TIMES THAT WILL FIX BREATHE MECHANICS JUST BY TE FAULT AND WE CAN MAY BE TALK ABOUT WHY THAT IS LATER BUT THAT WOULD BE MY SORT OF W ONE SENTENCE PULL UPOINT ANSWER IMMEDIATELY I'VE HOW TO GETIN MY POSITIONS THE SECOND ONE WOULD BE SIMPLY LOOKING AT YOUR POSTURE WRIHT SO WHETHER YOU'RE HON O BAKE OR YOUR A DOING A LIFT OR YOUR RUNNING IF YOU'RE LITERALLY A HUNCHED OVER AND YOUR RIBS OR TOUCHING YOUR FEMER OR GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER LIKE A TENDS TO HAPPEN ON A BIKE OR AN ARASAULT THING SOMEBODY HAVE SEEN RECENTLY THIS MORNING I WAS ON THE ASSAULT BIKE A DOING A A SPRINT A AND I ASKED AND DOCTOR GALPAN TO A CRITIQUE MY FORM AND ANYTHING ELSY WAN TO CRTIQUE SO THAT I COULD IMPROVE AND HE DID COMMENT ON MY RATHER SEA SHAPED POSTURE CORRECT I'M ENCOURAGE ME TO A BE MORE UPRIGHT WHICH I SHOULD PROTY DO NOW AS WELL AND HE ALSO CUTE ME TO THE FACT THAT DURING ONE MINUTE SPRINT THERE IS SOMETHING THAT IS QUOTINC MAGIC THAT HAPPENS RGT ABOUT THE FORTY SECOND MARK AND I USE THAT AS A AM AS A MILESTONE A TO LOOK FOR IN INDEED SOMETHING DOES HAPPEN AT THE FORTY SECOND INTO ONE MINUTE SPRINT WHERE ALL A SENDING IT DOES SEEM TO GET MUCH EASIER FOR REASON THAT UNDERSTAND MAY BE CAN IT TALLS THAT BUT IT CERTAINLY HAD NOTHINGTO D WITH MY POSTURE MY POSTURE NEEDS IMPROVEMENT YET YOU WILL YET SO AM BREATHING MECHANICS AND BRING STRATEGIES A PEOPLE TEND TO BE OVERBREATHING EARLY ON AND IS IS CAN LEAD TO PROBLEMS LATER SO HAVING A MORE STRATEGIC BREATHING PATTERN I AN APPROACH IT IS AGAIN A VERY QUICK SOLUTION I KNOW THAT WE ARE GOING TO DIE VERY DEEP INTO THE MECHANISMS OF ENERGY A METABOLISM AND ENDURANCE TO DAY BUT AS LONG AS WE'RE ING A DISCUSSION ABOUT THESE A BRIEF OR TIDBITS OF HOW TO IMPROVE ENDURANCE ARE THERE ANY OTHER WAYS TO IMPROVE ENDURANCE THAT ARE OF RELATIVELY SHORT TIME INVESTMENT EVEN IF THEY REQUIRE A LOT OF A ENERGY SHORT THE CLASSIC PARADINE RE TO FIND HERE IS STEADY STATE LONG DURATION POSET UP AGAINST WHAT A LOT OF FOLKS WILL NOWT CALL HIGHER INTENSITY INTERVAL TRAINING SPECIFICALLY AND THERE'S A LOT OF MIS CONCEPTIONS HERE THE QUICK ANSWER S YOU NED TO BE DOING BOTH AND THERE'S PROBABLY MUNCH TO STUFF IN BETWEEN THAT YOU SHOULD BE PRACTICING IF YOU HONTESTLY WANT A MAXIMIZE THOSE THREE FACTORIES WE TALKED ABOUT AT THE BEGINNING YOU NEED TO BE TRAINING ACROSS HIS FULL SPECTRUM JUST LIKE I TOLD YOU TO TRAIN ACROSS THE FULL SPECTRUM OF YOUR LIFTING WE WANT TO BE DOING THE SAME THING HERE SO ARE THERE INDEPENDENT SPECIAL FACTORS THAT CAN HAPPEN WITH THE SHORTER TIME LENGTH HIER INTENSIS OF ABSOLUTELY THERE'S ALSO MAGIC THAT HAPPENS ON THE OTHER END OF THAT SPECTROM SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE DON'T JUST CHOOSE ONE SIDE BECAUSE WHAT TENDS TO HAPPEN IST PEOPLE EITHER GO WITH A O MAN TO DO THIRTY OR FORTY FIVE MINUTES OF STEADY STATE STUFF THAT'S IT OR I'M GOING O TO THE OPPOSITE WHICH I MAY LEAVE THAT STUFF ON A TABLE NOT DO IT CAUSE I ONLY WANT TO DO HIGH INTENTS THE INTERVALSE CAUSE I CAN GET IT DOWN IN FIVE MINUTES SO THERE'S MAGIC ON BOTH SIDES THE EQUATION WE WANT TO GET INTO ALL THAT BUT JUST TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION DIRECTLY THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH O OF THINGS YOU CAN DO 'M IN UNDER ONE MINUTE 'MTHAT ARE CONVENIENT TO DO AND THERE'S A A WONDERFUL SET OF PAPERS I'M OUT OF A COUPLE L LABORATORIES IN CANADA THAT THAT CHAMPION THIS IDEA THAT'S CALLED EXERCISE SNACKS SO THERE'S A BUNCH THRES A SERIES OF STUDIES HAVE BEEN DONE HERE THAT ARE REALLY INTERESTING AND THAT THE'VE LOOKED AT A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT ARE NOTWORTHY ONE OF EM IS A TWENTY SECOND BOUT OF ALL OUT WORK AND THIS IS ACTUALLY DONE IN WORKERS AN AN OFFICE AND SO WHAT THEY HAVE THEM DO HIS RUN UP STAIRS  I BELIEVE IT WAS ABOUT SIXTY STEPS IS IS WHAT IT TOOK THEM SOMETHING ALONG THE ORDER OF TWENTY SECONDS EXACTLY AND THEY REPEATED THAT I'M ABOUT ONCE EVERY FOUR HOURS SO REALLY IS YOU GO TO WORK YOU GET YOUN PUT YOU COFFEEIN YOUR BACK DOWN WHATEVER YOU RUN UP A FLIGT OFSTAIRS TWENTY SECONDS LATER THAN YOU ARE A BACK TO WORK AT LUNCH AND BEFORE YOU GO HOME YOU SU REPUTED THERE I AND IF YOU REPEAT THAT THAT'S MOSTPLE TIMES A WEEK YOU GING TO DO THAT I THINK THEY IN WHONE THE NTERVENTIONS IT WAS THREE TIMES A WEEK FOR SIX WEEKS EIGHTEEN TOTAL TIMES YOU DID THAT AND WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS I'M A A NOTICEABLE IMPROVEMENT IS ISTATITICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS AN CARDY RESIRATORY FITNESS SPECIFICALLY VEAL TO MACKS AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF COGNETIVE BENEFITS WORK PRODUCTIVITY ET CETERA THAT CAN HAPPEN AN AS LITTLE AS TWENTY SECONDS YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO THE GIM YOU DON'T HAVE TO SHOW OR YOU NONL HAVE TO DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT JUST FIND THE STAIRS I RUN UP AND DOWN IM A FEW TIMES NOW YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED I'M YOU ACTUALLY SORT OF CAUGHT ME YESTERDAY I DID THAT RIGHT HERE RIGHT I AVE SIST I AND WE HD LITTE BIT OF BRAK I WAS FEELING AND ENERGY LALL I RAN UP THE STAIRS THREE OR FOUR TIMES FELT A LOT BETTER SO THAT CAN ACTUALLY ALSO HELP THERRE AN ANOTHER STUDY WIT THEY LOOKED AT THAT FOLLOWING A GIANT HIGH GLY SEEMIC INDEXS MEAL AND WHAT THEY SAW AND THEY TOOK INSOLENT MEASURERS AND AND A WHOLE BUNCH O A I'M OTHER BIOLOGICAL MARKERS ASSOCIATED THAT YOU WANT TO BE PAYATENTION WITH THE HIGH GLY SEEMIC INDEX MEAL AND THEY LOOKED AT THOSE IMMEDIATELY AN HOUR OR THREE HOURS SIX HOURS IS UPPOST AND IT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT SAME INTERVENTION WAS ABLE TO IMPROVE POSTPLAN YEL LUCOST CONTROL INSOLEND AN A WHOLE BONH TO OTHER FACTORS I'M IN ADDITION THAT SO IF YOU ARE THIT SORT OF TYPE WHO'S LIKE WILE I'M IN AN OFFICE ALL DAY MAY BE ALSO HOW TA GIANT A HIGH GLI SEEME CANNEXT MEAL  NOT THE BEST APPROACH BUT A LITTLE BIT O MITIGATION THERE CAN JUST BE RUNNING UP A FLIGHT OF STAIRS OR DOING SOMETHING LIKE THAT FOR S LITTLE AS TWENTY SECONDS SO THERE'S A LOT OF MAGIC AND POWER IN MAXIMUL EXERTION IF ONE DOES NOT HAVE ACCESS TO A FLIGHT OF STAIRS AT WORK COULD THEY DO JUMPING JACKS ABSOLUTE I MEAN YOU COULD DO ANYTHING YOU REALLY WANTED 'M IT'S NOT THE MODE OF EXERCISE THAT MATTERS HERE IT IS SIMPLY THE EXERTION I YOU GET UP IS AS HAR AS YOU CAN YOU COULD DO BERPES YOU COL DO ANY NUMBER OF THINGS I'M YOU CUL SPRINT DOWN YOUR ROAD DOWN THE WHALLWAY BACK AND FOURTH I THE MODE IS IS JUST A SOMETHNGTHAT WAS EASY FOR THE SCIENTIST TO CONTROL A EX NUMBER OF STEPS PEOPLE COULD DO IT NYOU R TO FALL HURT YOURSELF THINGS LIKE THAT JUST TO REMIND ME IT'S ONCE EVERY FOUR HOURS ONE MINUTE A ALL AS SAC O TWENTY SECONDS CUSE ME A TWENTY SECONDS OF E SENTIALY ALL OUT EXERTION YET WHILE REMAINING SAFE NOT GOING SO FAST UP THE STAIRS ARE DOING JOMA JACONS AE THEY OT DOWN THE STAIRS UP THE STAIRS PLACE A ASK LATERS DON'T COUNT LEST WAS THEY COUNT IF THE'RE A YOU'RE NOUG HERE IF YOUARE MOVING A IF YOU'RE NOT REMAINING ON THE SAME THE STEPS A INFACTED IN IR PORT RECENTLY I SAW SOMEBODY WALKING AGAINST THE OTHE THE CONVEYER YET WHILE TALKING ON THE PHONE WHILE WAITING FOR THEIR FLIGHT TO TAKE OFF  THA ITS GENIUS RIGHT YT LOT A L AWKWARD ERS YES BUT ITAS I HAVE LOOKED ARGUAR AND EVERY AIRPORT I'VE BEEN INFOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS FOR THESE EXACTORY SINCE DOING WILD STUFF LIKE THAT NOW WILL NOTHING'S MORE AWKWARD THAN NOT BEING ABLE TO WALK TO THE END OF THE TERMINAL SIMPLYCAUS ONE ISN'T FAMILIAR WITH WALKING THAT FAR CARRYING A COUPLE OF SUIT CASES SARY YET THAT'S A THE OTHER FIT TEST NOHA SIX CASE CARRIER YEH IN THE AREPORT I LOVE THIS SO ONCE EVERY FOUR HOURS TWENTY SECONDS WO MAY BE ONCE WHEN ARRIVING TO WORK ONCE FOUR HOURS IN AND THEN FOUR HOURS I MUST BE A PRIVATE WORK SOMEWHERE YOUNOW E IT PLUSTERMINEST TWO HOURS NOW ONE THING ACTUALLY REALLY ANT TO MAKE CLEAR BECAUSE YOU'RE AUDIENCE IS SO INCREDIBLE IM THEY TENDED TO BE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THESE PROTOCOLS THEY FOLLOW THEM EXACTLY AS WRITTEN THAT'S NOT EXACTLY OU SCIENCE WORKS SO IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HALF TO BE EVERY FOUR HOURS ISN'T HALF THREE THREE TEMES AT ATE ASN'T HALF TO BE TWENTY SECONDS THEYE LITERALLY BUILT THAT PROTOCALL BECAUSE IT WAS TRUTHY TRYING TERRUPLICATE A REALIFE CINARIO MAYBE U IN AN OFFICE BUILDING YOU'RE GENERALLY THERE FOR EIGHT HOURS LET'S SEE IF YOU DID ONE EVERY SORT OF  I SO IF YOU WANT TO DO IT FOUR TIMES WE GREAT IF YOU CAN DO IT ONLY TEN SECONDS AMAZING YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO GET THE SAME BENEFITS THOSE NOT THE DETAILS TO PANTEND TO DO THE DETAIL TO PAY ATTENTION TO IS EVERY SO OFTEN MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY TRY TO GET YOUR HORRIDE UP REALY QUICKLY DOESN'T REQUIRE SWEATING AS REQUIRE ANYTHING ELSE TERE'S NO WARM UP ASSOCIATED WITH IT I'M AGAIN YOU NEED A MINUTE BREAK AND BETWEEN MEETINGS ARE WHATEVER AND YOU CAN SPRENT UP THEM I DO THIS ALL THE TIME IN MY HOUSE WHEN YOURE YOU HAVE THOSE DAYS WHEN YOU'RE UN LIKE SEVEN STRAIGHT OURS ASSUMES ET CETERA YOU CAN GET OUT OF TWENTY SECONDS I RUN TO MY GARAGE WHICH IS OVER THERE I HOP ON THE THE AIR BIKE AND I WILL JUST SMASH OUT THIRTY SECONDS AS FAST I CAN AND WALK RIGHT BACK GAN LOV IT YET A MEN A START YET JUST BALSO YOU CAN JUST PUT ONEOF THOSE THINGS WHICH I DO ALSO JUS PUT ON IN YOUR OFFICE AND HOP OVER IT OF THER  THE WHOLE ENTIRE THING NOW LITERALLY TAKES TWENTY THREE SECONDS BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS ALSO SEPARATE FROM DOCTOR ANY GALPINS TEACHING AND RESEARH ROLLS AT CALSTATE FULLERTON IT IS HOWEVER PART OF OUR DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRINGS YOUROCOSTIC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME WE'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS MOMENTOUS MOMENTOUS MAKE SUPPLEMENTS OF THE ABSOLUTE HIGHEST QUALITY THE YOUBURMEN LAB PODCAST IS PROUD TO BE PARTNERING WITH MOMENTOUS FOR SEVERAL IMPORTANT REASONS FIRST OF ALL AS I MENTION THEIR SUPPLEMENTS ARE OF EXTREMELY HIGH QUALITY SECOND OF ALL THEIR SUPPLEMENTS ARE GENERALLY IN SINGLE INGREDIENT FORMULATIONS IF YOU'RE GOING TO DEV LP A SUPPLEMENTATION PROTOCALL YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO FOCUS MAINLY ON USING SINGLE INGREDIENT FORMULATIONS WITH SINGLE INGREDIENT FORMULATIONS YOU CAN DEVISE THE MOST LOGICAL AND EFFECTIVE AND COST EFFECTIVE SUPPLEMENTATION REGIMENT FOR YOUR GOALS IN ADDITION MOMENTOUS SUPPLEMENT SHIP INTERNATIONALLY AND THIS IS OF COURSE IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE REALIZE THAT MANY OF THE HUBERMNLAPOD CAST LISTENERS RESIDE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IF YOUD LIKE TO TRY THE VARIOUS SUPPLEMENTS MENTION ON THE HUBERMANLABPODCAST IN PARTICULAR SUPPLEMENTS FOR FORMON HEALTH FOR SLEEP OPTIMIZATION FOR FOCUS AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS INCLUDING EXERCISE RECOVERY YOU CAN GO TO LIVEMOMENTOUS SPELLED O U EST SO THAT LIVMOMENTOUS DOTCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY LEVELS BLEVELS IS A PROGRAM TAT LETS YOU SEE HOW DIFFERENT FOODS AND ACTIVITIES AFFECT YOUR HEALTH BY GIVING YOU REAL TIME FEED BACK ON YOUR BLOOD LUCOS YUSING A CONTINUOUS GLUCOS MONITOR MANY PEOPLE ARE AWARE THAT THEIR BLOOD SUGAR THAT IS THEIR BLOOD GLUCOS LEVEL IS CRITICAL FOR EVERYTHING FROM FAT LOSS TO MUSCLE GAIN TO HEALTHY COGNITION AND INDEED AGING OF THE BRAIN AND BODY MOST PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW HOWEVER HOW DIFFERENT FOODS AND FOR AN ACTIVITIES INCLUDING EXERCISE OR DIFFERENT TEMPERATURED ENVIRONMENTS IMPACK THEIR BLOOD LUCOS LEVELS AND YET BLOODLUCOS IS EXQUISITELY SENSITIVE TO ALL OF THOSE THINGS I FIRSTARTED USING LEVELS ABOUT A YEAR AGO AS A WAY TO UNDERSTAND HOW DIFFERENT FOODS EXERCISE AND TIMING OF FOOD RELATIVE TO EXERCISE AND QUALITY OF SLEEP AT NIGHT IMPACK MY BLOOD LUCOS LEVELS AND I'VE LEARNED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT FROM USING LEVELS IT'S TAUGHT ME WHEN BEST TO EAT WHAT BEST TO EAT WHEN BEST TO EXERCISE HOW BEST TO EXERCISE AND HOW TO MODULATE MY ENTIRE SCHADUAL FROM WORK TO EXERCISE AND EVEN MY SLEEP SIF YOUR INTEREST IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT LEVELS IN TRYING AT CONTINUOUS GLUCOS MONTER YOURSELF GO TO LEVELS DOT LINK SLASH HUBERMEN THAT'S LEVELS DOT LINK SLASH HUBERMEN TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENTS ELEMENT IS AN ELECTROLITE DRINK THAT CONTAINS THE EXACT RATIOS OF THE ELECTROLITE SODIUM MAGNESUM IN POTASSIUM TO OPTIMIZE CELLER FUNCTIONING FOR MENTAL AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE MOST PEOPLE REALIZE THAT HYDRATION IS KEY WE NEED TO INGEST IN OUG FLUIDS IN ORDER TO FEEL OUR BEST AND PERFORM OUR BEST BUT WHAT MOST PEOPLE DO NOT REALIZE IS THAT THE PROPER FUNCTIONING OF OUR SELLS AND NERVE CELLS NURONS IN PARTICULAR REQUIRES THAT SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM BE PRESENT IN THE CORRECT RATIOS NOW OF COURSE PEOPLE WITH PREHIPRETENSION AND HY PRETENSION NEED TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT THEIR SODIUMEN TAKE BUT WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IS THAT IF YOU DRINK CAFFIN IF YOU EXERCISE AND IN PARTICULAR IF YOUR FALLING O VERY CLEAN DIET THAT IS NOT A LOT OF PROCESS FOODS WHICH OF COURSE IS A GOOD THING CHANCES ARE YOU'RE NOT GETTING ENOUGH SODIUM POTASSIUM AND MAGNESIUM TO OPTIMIZE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE ELEMENT CONTAINS A SCIENCE BACKED RATIO

IS ENDURANCE HOW DO I GET MORE ENDURANCE AND HOW DOES IT WORK WHEN WE THINK ABOUT ENDURANCE I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP THE CONVERSATION TO INCLUDE MORE THINGS THAN PEOPLE GENERALLY DO WHEN THEY HERE THE WORD ENDURANT SO IF WE JUST THNK ABOUT WHAT YOU TYPICALLY ASK YOUR BODY TO DO OR WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOUR BODY TO DO AND WE JUST WALK THROUGH THEM IT'S GOING T BE THINGS LIKE THIS NUMBER WHEN I WNT O HAVE ENERGY THROUGHOUT THE DAY THAT'S ACTUALLY FORM OF ENDURANCE GREAT I DONT WANT TO HAVE THESE LALLS AND FATIGUE AND I WANT O FEEL FANTASTIC AS I MOVE THROUGHOUT MY ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING WHATEVER THOSE MAY BE WORK EXRCISE ENJOYINGMENT COGNPAYING ATTENTION FOCUS ALL THAT STOP GREAT THAT'S ONE THING ANOTHER THING YOU'LL WANT T ASK YOUR BODY TO DO IS I WANT TO BE ABLE TO REPEAT SOME SMALL EFFORT IN A MUSCLE GROUP AND NOT AND FEEL GREAT ABOUT THAT THIS IS WHAT WE GENRALLY CALL MUSC ULAR ENDURANCE SO THIS IS SOMETHING LIKE I WANT TO BE ABLE TO LOCK UP THOSE TEN FLIGHTS OF STEPS AND MY QUADS AREN'T BURNING AT THE END OF IT RIGHT OR IT'S EVEN GIVES ME ENERGY ANOTHER THING YOU'LL WANTO ASK YOUR BODY TO DO IS TO BE ABLE TO PERFORM A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK FOR A LONGER PERIODOF TIME SOMETHING IN THE REALM OF YOU TWENTY TO EIGHTY SECONDS SO THIS COULD BE SOMETHING LIKE IF YOU'RE SURFING AN YOU'VE GOT A PADDLE EXTREMELY HARD FOR A MINUTE TO GET ON ON TOPIC WAVE OR YOU AUNT IT YOU'VE GOT YOU'RE OUTRITING YOU'R BIKE AND YOU NEED BEILL TO GET UP A HILL IN ITS VERY STEEP HILL THE'S OUEGING TO TAKE MAXIMUL EFFORTS FOR SOME SMALLE AMOUNT OF TIME AN THEN YOU GET BACK UP THERE WE TEND TO CALL THAT MAXIMUM ANEROBA CAPACITY SO THE MAXIMOUNT TOF WORK YOU CAN PERFORM AT A HIGH RATE FOR SOME AMOUNT A SECONDE TO THAT MAYBE A MINUTE PAST THAT IS YOUR ABILITY TO REPEAT AND AFFOR A KIND LIKE THAT FOR SOMETHING LIKE FIVE TO FIFTEEN MINUTES AND THIS IS TH EXAMPLE WOULD BE RON A MILE RIGHT SOME SOME INTERVALE LIKE THAT WHICH IS A LONGER DISTANCE RIGHT THAT IS GING TO BE OU MAXIMUM A ROBIC CAPACITY ANOTHER THING YOURECNT WANT YOUR BODY TO DO IS WOU CALL SUSTAIN POSITION SO THIS IS YOU WANT TO BEABLE TO SIT IN YOUR CHAIR AT WORK AND HAVE PERFECT POSK YOUR FOR TWENTY THIRTY FORTY MINUTE RIGHT YOU ANT TO BEL TO STAND AND LYING AT A GROCERY STORE FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES AND NOT HAVE A BREAK DOWN IN POSTR SO YOU ON TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN POSITION WHEN YOU'RE RITING YOU'R BIKE YOU'RE NOT COLLAPSING YOU'RE DOING ANY OF THESE ACTIVITIES AND YOU DON'T GET HURK OR LOSE EFFICIENCY SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T SUSTAIN BASIC POSITIONS AND WHAT EVER THOSE SHAPES AND POSITION SEEM TO BE AND THEN THE LAST ONE IS A A MAXIMUM DISTANCE SO YOU WR ONT TO BEABLE TO GO FOR A LONGER HIKE OR HOVE JUST A LONG DAY AT DIZZY LAND FOR WHATEVER IT NEES TO BE AND FEEL GREAT AT THE END OF IT RIGHT SO THE GOAL WITH ALL OF THESE THINGS IS NOT CAN YOU JUST DO THEM BUT CAN YOU DO THEM AND THEN YOU FEEL GOOD AFTERWARD SOLOERE BACK IN A RIGHT POSITION WHERE THEY GIVE YOU ENERGY YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT AND IT'S NOT TO SOMETHING YOU HAD TO DO IN YOU REGRETTED AND YOU FELT DOUBHTFUL SO THOSE THE FACTORS I THINK ABOUT WHEN SOME ONE SAYS I WANT BETTER ENDURANCE IS I N A W ALK BACKWARDS AS OW CAN WEN YOU SAND DURANCE WHAT YOU MEAN AND THAT'S GENERALLY THE THINGS I'VE COME ACROSS AS IF YOU CAN HANDLE ALL OF THOSE THINGS YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL LIKE YOUR IN FANTASTIC SHAPE YOU'REGOING TO FEEL YOURE RECOVERIES GOING TO BE EXCELLENT AND YOURE PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE IN THE GIM OR AN ANY THIS WORTING ACTIVITIES YOU DO WILL BE ENHANCED GIVEN WHAT YOU TOLD US A LOBIT EARLIER THAT ENDURANCE REALLY REFLECTS FATIGUEIN MANAGEMENT AND ENERGY PRODUCTION HOW DO EACH AND BOTH OF THOSE THINGS RELATE TO ENDURANCE AT A MECHANISTIC LAVEL YO REALLY WHAT I'M MASK IS WHAT IS FATIGUE MANAGEMENT AND WHAT IS ENERGY PRODUCTION IN ORDER TO DO THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE UNDERSTAND ALL F THOSE FUNCTIONAL CAPACITIES THAT I JUST TALKED ABOUT THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT POINTS OF FAILURE SO IN ORDER TO THEN WORK BACKWARDS AND SAY WELL HOW DO I OPTIMIZE MY PERFORMANCE AN ALL THOSE CATEGORIES WE NEED TO GO THROUGH EACH ONE A FIGUREOU WILL WER A I FAILING SOME OF THEM ARE GONG O BE FAILING BECAUSE OF FATIGUE MANAGEMENT AND SOME OF THEM WILL BE FAMILY BECAUSE OF ENERGY PRODUCTION ISSUES SO IF WE WALK THROUGH A LITTLE BIT OF HOW WE MAKE ENERGY AND HOW WE HANDLE FATIGUE THEN WE GONT HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTAND OF EXACTLY WHAT TO DO FOR EACH ONE THESE CATEGORIES IF YOU FEEL LIKE ONE THEM IN PARTICULAR IS AWORSE FOR YOU ARE LAGGING BEHIND OR IF IN GENERAL YOU JUST WAN TO IMPROVE ALL OF THEM ALL IGHT NOW ON TO MAKE A LITTLE BIT OF A NINETY DEGRE TURN HERE I'M IGH TO DO WITH STRATAGY TH T I PROMISE AND OW WONT ASK A VERY SIMPLE QUESTION HOW DO YOU LOSE WEIGHT I WAS TAUGHT THAT THE CALORIES IN CALORIES OUT THERMODYNAMICS OF AENERGY UTILIZATION GOVERNS MOST EVERYTHING THAT IS IF I'M INJESTING LESS COLORIC ENERGY THAN I BURN THEN I'M GOING TO LOSE WEIGHT AND IF I'M ANJESTING EXACTLY AS MUCH AS I BURN O MAINTAIN WAIT AND IF I'M JUST MORE THAN I BURN THEN I'LL GAINWAIY SURE THAT IS THE APPROACH YOU WOULD TAKE WHAT I'M ASKING REALLY IS HOW IRE YOU ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY LOSING THE WEIGHT SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WE HAVE DIFFERENT FUEL SOURCES IN THE BODY GLICAGEN WHICH IS STORTDED MUSCLE AND LIVER BODY FAT WHICH IS SORED IN MAINLY WHITE ATAPOST ISSUE AND WHICH IS SUBCUTANEOUS AN AROUND OUR ORGANS INTRAVISORAL FAT AND THAT WE CAN ALSO USE PROTINE AS A FUEL AND THAND AS I RECALL THERE'S ALSO A PHOSPHO CREETING SYSTEM AND I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME THAT EACH OF THESE SYSTEMS IS TAPPED IN TO ON DIFFENT TIME SKILLS AND PERHAPS ACCORDING TO DIFFERENT LEVELS OF EXERTION AND I'M CERTAIN THAT WHAT I JUST SAID IS NOT EXHAUSTIVE BUT HOFULLY IT IS MOST OR ENTIRELY CORRECT PRETTY CORRECT WHAT'S IVE GOT TO DO WITH THATLOSS AT SOME POINTS ABODY FAT STORIES ATAPOSE ATAPOSITES FAT SELLS ARE GOING TO START LIBERATING FAT AS A FUEL SOURCE AND THE STIMULUS FOR THAT I'M ASSUMING IS GOING TO BE THAT OTHER FUEL SOURCE S ARE EITHER TOPLEADED OR THAT THE ENERGY METABOLIC SYSTEMS OF THE BODY I DON'T LESS HE DECIDE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THEIR OWN CONSCIOUSNESS OR AT ARE A OR FLISIGNOR IS OUR SIGNALLING IN A WAY THAT REGISTERS THAT A BODY FAT WOULD BE THE OPTIMAL FUEL SOURCE GIVEN HOW LONG OR INTET ENDOR INTENSELY A GIVEN ACTIVITY HAS BEEN PERFORMED OKATE WE HAVE SOME SUF TO CLEAN UP THERE BUT WE'RE STILL NOT REALLY ANSWER IN THE QUESTION HOW AM I ACTUALLY LOSING THAT BODY FAT AH HOW IS ACTUALLY LEAVING THE BODY CORRECT A MINERSTANDING IS THAT IT LEAVES THE BODY THROUGH RESPIRATION AA SO NOW WE HAVE SOME INTERESTING THINGS TO TALK ABOUT HOW AM I ACTUALLY LOSING FAT THE A RESPIRATION WHAT THE HELL IS OUT EVEN ME HOW IS SOMETHING THAT OCCUPIED THIS PHYSICAL SPACE ON THE SIDE OF ME LEAVING MY BODY THROUGH MY MOUTH AND THAT IS THE VERY CLEAR ANSWER THERE RIGHT WHICH I I'M SURE YOU'RE CEWED UP TO WHEN YOU TAKE A BREATH IN YOU'RE GENERALLY BREATHING IN OXYGEN O TO SOME OTHER THINGS BUT WILL A STICK TOXION WHEN YOU EXHALE YOU'RE BREATHING OUT SEAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO IS THAT CARBON MOLECULE WELL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND HERE IS LL OF YOUR CARBL HYDRATES WHICH IS THO THAT WORD ITSELF IS A CARBON THAT HAS BEEN HYDRATED SO IT OES A CARBON MOLECULE ATTACHE TO A WATER MOLECULE IT IS A SIMPLE CHAIN OF CARBONS YOUR FAT MOLECULES ARE ALSO CHANGE OF CARBON ALL OF MATABOLISM REALLY IN TERMS OF ENERGY PRODUCTION IS SIMPLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO BREAK THOSE CARBON BONDS AS A RESULT WE GET ENERGY FROM THAT WE USE THAT ENERGY TO CREATE OR MOLECULE CALLED A T P WHICH IS THE CENTRAL SOURCE OF ENERGY FOR ANY LIVING BEING IM THAT CARBON IS THEN FLOATING AROUND OUR FREE FORM WHICH IS BAD NEWS INTERNALLY SO WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET THAT CARBON OUT OF OUR SYSTEM SO ALL OF ENERGY PRODOXION ALL O FATIGUE MANAGEMENT REALLY COMES DOWN TO THIS CORIIS YOU HAVE HOW ARE WE HANDLING CARBON AND HOW ARE WE MOVING AROUND THE BODY AND SO WHAT WE DO IS WE DO THIS NEAKY THINGS TO ANOTHER QUESTION I LIKE TO ASK PEOPLE IS WHY DO WE BREATHE WELL FOR TWO REASONS A TO BRING OXYGEN INTO THE SYSTEM INTO OFFLOD CARBON DI OXIDE BUT THE NURAL TRIGGER FOR BREATHING IS WHEN CARBONDOXIDE IT'S A THRESHOLD LEVEL IN THE SET OF NURONS IN THE BRAINSTEM AND ELSEWHERE A ACTIVATE THE PHRAENTIC NERVE OF THE GAS REFLECTS OR COMMONATION OF THINGS AND WE IN HAL OR IN HAL RIGHT SO A REDUCTION OF OXYGEN IN TAKE GENERALLY DOESN'T STIMULATE VENTILATION UNLESS YOU'RE AT ALTITUDE THEN THAT SORT OF CHANGES RIGHT IN GENERAL IT'S AN ELEVATION IN SEAL TO THAT'S CONSTIMULATE BRINTING OP THE ONLY REASON YOU BRING IN O TOO FOR THE MOST PARD IS TO GET RID OF THE SEAL TO OXYGEN IS NT A FEEL SOURCE IT IS NOT A WAY N IS WORKS TO SING WITH FIRE BY THE WAY SO YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO HAVE OXYGEN PRESENT FOR FIRE TO GOING IF YOUSE QUELCT OXYGEN THE FIRE WILL GO OUT RIGHT THAT'S OT HALF OF A HOW THOSE LIKE FIRE EXTINGUISHER'S WORK BUT WE THINK THEN THAT MEANS OXION IS THE FUEL IT IS NOT THE FUEL IT IS SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT IT IS A NECESSARY PR IS A PRODUCT THAT IS NECESSARY FOR THE METABOLIS AND PROCES TO ACTUALLY OCCURE RIGHT SO WEE WERE KIND OF DANCING AROUND AN IDEA HERE WHICH IS THIS CARBON CYCLE OF LIFE SO WHAT HAPPENS IN PLANTS IS THEY GENERALLY WILL BREATHE IN THE OPPOSITE AND BREATHE OUT THE OPOSIT OF HUMAN SO A PLANT WILL BREATHE IN SEO TO AND EXHAL O TO RIGHT THIS IS WHY WE HAVE TO HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF THESE THINGS AND ALGY IN FORESTS AND TREES AN SELF TO MAINTAIN THIS O TO SEL TO BALANCE IN OUR ATMOSPHERE WE DO THE OPPOSITE SO WE HAVE THIS WONDERFUL CIRCLE OF LIFE WE BREATHE IN O TO BRETHE OUT SEAL TO THEY DO THE OPPOSITE WELL WHAT HAPPENS IS BECAUSE CARBO HYDRATES ARE LONG CHAINS OF CARBON AND FATS ARE AS WELL GENERALY WHEN WE THINK ABOUT FATS BY THE WAY IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT STRUCTURE A LITTLE BI SO IF WE THINK ABOUT TRYCLISTERIDES IT IS A THREE CARBON BACKBONE CHAIN OF GLICER ALSO ONE TO THREE AND HORIZONTALLY RUNNING OFF OF EACH ONE OF THOSE OUR FATTY ACID CHAINS RAGT SO WE FORM THIS STRUCTURE THAT LOOKS LIKE AN E RIGHT LIKE THE LETTER E THREE IN THE BACK AND IN THREE CHAINS COMING OFF OF IT EACH OF THOSE CHAINS ARE CALED FATYACIDS IN EACH OF THOSE FATYACIDS OR A LENGTH OF CARBON RIGHT  A NUMBER OF CARBNS STRUNG TOGETHER HOWEVER MANY CARBONS ARE THERE DETERMINES WHICH TYPE OF FATYACID IT IS RIGHT SOSTERIC ACID LAN LIKE ACLIC ANY DIFFERENT NUMBER OF THINGS IT'S ALSO WHAT DETERMINES WHETHER NOT IS A MONOAN SATURATED OR POLLYON SATURATED IS IF AM CARBON REQUIRES THE SPECIAL THING CALLE A DOUBLE BOND SO IF THERE'S A DOUBLE BOND ACROSS EVERY CARBON CARBON TAN THEIR ALFULLY SATURATED IN YOUR GRATE IF THERE IS ANYUM THAT ARE NOT DOUBLE BONDED AND IN FACT AN EXAMPLE IF THERE IS ONE THAT DOESN'T HAVE A DOUBLE BOND THAT IS NOW CALLED MONO ENSATURTED IF THERE ARE MANY IT IS CALLED POLLYON SATURAD SO THE'S PROSAN CONS TO ALL THESE THINGSRIGHT IN EITHER CASE WE'RE STILL TALKING LONG CARBON CHAINS SO WHAT A PLANT WILL DO IS BRING IN CARBON AND THEN IT HAS THIS WONDERFUL ABILITY TO USE ENERGY FROM THE SUN CALLED PHOTO SYNTHESIS AND IT CAN TAKE THOSE CARBONS THAT IT INHALS AND USE THE ENERGY FROM THE SUN TO FORM A BOND NOW IN OUR PRIOR DISCUSSION WHEN WE ARE A GOING OVER HYPERTROPHY WE TALKED ABOUT THE ENERGY EQUIRED TO GO THROUGH PROCHINE SYNTHESIS THAT'S BECAUSE FORMING A NEW ATAM A NEW BLOND BETWEEN ADAMS OFTEN TIMES TAKES ENERGY IN THIS CASES IT DOES THE SAME THING HAPPENS HERE SO IF A PLANT DOES NOT HAVE OXYGEN OR DOES NOT HAVE CARBON OXIDE IN THE AIR IT HAS NO FUEL THAT BAS COAND THINK ABOUT IT IS THAT'S WHAT IT EATS IN EAS TO GET NITROGEN FROM THE GROUND IN THE SOIL DUS LIKE WE NEED O GET NITROGEN FROM OUR PROTEEN BUT FUEL LIES IN EASE TO GET CARBONA OXIDE THEN IT NEEDS SUN TO GIVE IT ENERGY SO THAT I CAN ACTUALLY FORM THAT BOND RIGHT THAT'S WHAT IT'S GETTING ITS FUEL FROM RIGHT SO IF WE THINK ABOUT A A CLASSIC A PLANT TO PRODUCE THE PLANT THAT PRODUCES EITHER A STARCH OR A FRUIT HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS IT INHALS THAT CARBON IN IN IT STARCS PACKING IT AWAY NOW IN A RUIT VEGETABLE WHAT IT DOES IS IT STORES THOSE THINGS TOGETHER AND IF WE STORE THAT THING AN WE GROW FRUIT O THE BOTTOM OF IT WE TEND TO CALL THOSE THINGS STARCES RIGHT IT'S GOING TO THEN TAKE THE CARBON THAT IS PACKED AWEIGHT IN ITS RUIT AND SEND IT UP THE TREE ND IT'S GOINIT ACTUALLY DO THAT BY BREAKING IT DOWN INTO A SMALLER FORM OF CARBOHYDRATE THAT WE TEND OFTEN CALL THINGS LIKE SUCROS AN GLUCCOS IT'LL SHIP THAT UP THE TREE IT'LL GO OFF TO THE LEAVES AND IT'LL CONVERTED INTO THE FRUIT AND IT'S CAN EVENTUALLY TRANSFORM THAT STUFF INTO SMALLER CARBON THINGS CALED FRUTOS AND IF WE THINK ABOUT THE FRUIT ARE THE SUGAR IN FRUIT IT'S OFTEN IN THE FORM OF FRUTOS OR SUCROS OR A COMBONATION IN SOMETIMES GLUCOS SO WE HAVE THESE SMALLER CARBON SIX CARBON CHAINS GENERALLY IN THE CAFORM OF GLUCOS THAT OURE BEING MADE FROM THIS LARGER STORAGE OF ACARBAHYDRATES THAT WE CALL STARCH RIGHT SO IT'S PACK INTOGETHER YOUR BODY DOES THE EXACT SAME THING SO IF IT'S A POTATO AND IT HAS A WHOLE BUNCH OF GLUCCOS PACKED AWAY WE CALL IT STARCH IF IT'S IN YOUR QUADRASTEP AND WE PACK ABOUT A WHOLE BUNCH OF GLUCCOS AWAY WE NOW CALL IT LICAGEN IF IT'S IN YOUR BLOOD AS THAT SIX CARBON CHAIN WE CALL IT GLUCCOS IF IT'S IN THE TREE AND IN THE FRUIT WE CALL IT FRUTOS RIGHT THOSE ARE IFFERENT MOLECULES BUT THAT'S EFFECTIVELY THE SAME THING HAPP AND SO THE BIOLOGY AR THE CAMISTIS IS ALMOST IDENTICAL IT JUST RUNS IN THE REVERSE ORDER AND THAT'S WHY AGAIN AT TUBERS AND POTATOES AND STUFF TEN TO BE STARCHES AND FRUITS TEND TO BE LUCOS FRUTOS SUCOS SO WE HAVE THIS WONDERFUL CIRCLE OF LIGHT THE PLANTS CAN SURVIVE ON JUST BREATHING IN THE SEO TO AND THEN GETTING ENERGY FROM THE SUN WE DON'T HAVE THAT ABILITY AT LEAST TO MY KNOWLEDGE TO RUN THROUGH FHOTO SYNTHESES SO THE ONLY WAY WE CAN GET CARBON INTO OUR SYSTEM IS TOT ACTUALLY IN JEST CARBON WHICH MEANS WE HAVE TO EAT THE STARCH THE FRUIT THE ANIMAL SOME OTHER FORM OF STORED CARBON TO GET THAT INDOR SYSTEM WE THEN PACK THAT AWAY WE PUT THE CARBOHYDRATES AS YOU MENTIONED EARLYER EITHER IN OUR LIVER OUR BLOOD OR IN OUR MUSCLES WE PUT THE FAT GENERALLY IN ATIPOST TISSUE WILL PUT A LITTLE BIT IN MUSCLE CELLS AS IN FROMUSCLECT RECTLESS RIDES AND EN THE PROTINE WILL USE AS STRUCTURE RANTO DO DIFFERENT THING WE DON'T LIKE TO USE PROTIN AS MATERIAL OUR FUEL IT'S IT'S BETTER USE O STRUCTURE AND WHAT WE HAVE TO DO THEN IS IF ALL THE SUDEN WE REALIZE THAT STORAGE IS GETTING TOO MUCH IN OUR BODY NO THE WORDS WERE GAINING TOO MUCH WEIGHT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THE CARBONS OUT OF OUR BODY AND THAT IS METABOLISM RIGHT ANY TIME WE'RE TRYING TO BREAK A CARBON BONDS THAUGH WE CAN GET ENERGY TO MAKE A T P THAT'S GOIN A RELEASE THE CARBON OUT OF OUR TISSUE AND THE BLOOD WE HAVE TO BRING IN OXYGEN TO BIND THAT CARBON MOLECULE TO MAKES SEO TO SO WE CAN EXHAIL IT AND PUT IT BACK INTO THE AT OSPHER IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DESCRIPTION OF THE CIRCLE OF LIFE AND ENERGY UTILIZATION IN THE HUMAN BODY I HAVE TO ASK THE QUESTION THAT I'M SURE MANY PEOPLE ARE WONDERING ABOUT WHICH IS IF INDEED WE EXHALE THESE CARBONS AND AS IT RELATES TO FAT LOSS THAT IS THE WAY THAT WE LOSE FAT IF WE'RE IN A SUMECOLORIC STATE FOR INSTANCE HAS IT EVER BEEN EXPLORED AS TO WETHER OR INCREASING THE DURATION OR INTENSITY OF EXALES CAN ECCELERATE FAT LOSS I'M A TAESOR THE LOGICAL EXTENSION OF WHAT YOU DESCRIBED AND HERE I'M ACTUALY INTERESTED A EQUALLY IN WHETHER NOT THE ANSWER IS YES AS WELL AS WHETHER IT COULD BE NO BECAUSE I COULD IMAGINE IF THE ANSWER IS YES WELL THEN THERE SOME INTERESTING PROTO CALLS TO EMERGE FROM THAT BUT THAT IF IT'S NO IT WILL REVEAL TO US SOME IMPORTANT BOTTLE NECKS ABOUT MATAVOLISM AND ENERGEGALIZATION YOU EVER SEEN THOSE MAGICIANS WHO LIKE SHOW UP AND A THEY CAN TELL YOUR MOB'S NAME OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BEFORE YOU COS SIC AN SORT OF OH I DON A PAT THE ID ME NOT TO TAKE US DOWN A DEEP DIVE TENSION BUT I ONCE WENT TO THE MAGIC CASTLE IN LOSS ANGELISTS AND I WAS ONE OFTHE PEOPLE CALLED UP FRONT AND A IN AN INCREDIBLE MAGICIAN A NAMED AN I THINK HIS NAME WAS OZIE MIND OR SOMETHING A I THINK THAT'S RIGHT HAD ME RIGHT MY NAME ON A CARD IN A SHARP BEPEN I RIPPED UP THE CARD I RIPPED IT UP I PUT IT IN MY POCKET AND AT THE END OF THE TEN OR FIFTEEN MINUTE BOWED OF HIM DOING A BUNCH OF OTHER TRICKS HE ASKED ME TO LOOK IN MY RIGHT SHOE AND UNDER MY FOOT IN MY RIGHT SHOE WAS THAT CARD INTACT YES AND IT WAS NO LONGER IN MY POCKET AND I SWEAR MY LIFE I WASN'T A A COLLABORATOR WITH THE AND TO THIS DAY IT'S STILL GIVES ME CHILLS BECAUSE IT  BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW  MAGIC YE RIGHT MAGIC WELL THE REASON I SAY THAT IS I'VE GIVEN THAT LITTLE SPEAL THATI JUST GAVE YOU THAT COUNTLESS TIMES OF MY GLASSES AND I WAS SAY NINEIINE FOR SOMTOF THE TIME AS SOON AS I STOP THE VERY FIRST QUESTION IS SO KIND DIST LIKE DO A BUNCH OF EXHALES LOOSE FAT WHICH IS WONDERFUL CAUSE I WAS REALLY HELPING YOUWOULD DO THAT AND YOU RURLED RIGHT INTO MY TRAP YOU LANDED PERFECTLY SILENT I LOOK LIKE A LIKE A A MAGICIAN ORE HERE I FEER LIKE I SHOULD LOOK IN MY RIGHT SHOE WRIGHT  NO I ASK THE QUESTION BECAUSE IT'S IT'S THE LOGICAL EXTENSION OF WHAT YOU LAID OUT BUT I NO BIOLOGY TO BE ON BOTH A DIABOLICAL  AND CRIPTIC BUT ALSO EXQUISITE IN THE WAY THAT THINGS ARE ARRANGED AND YOU DON'T GET SOMETHING FOR NOTHING THERE ARE NO FREE PASSES IN PHYSIOLOGY THAT'S THE SAME NO FREE PASSES ON THE ANSWER TO QUESTION IS YES ALON A HUNDRED PER CENT YES IN FACT THAT IS THE ONLY WAY TO GO ABOUT IT YOU HAVE TWO OPIONS YOU CAN INJEST LESS CARBON OR YOU CAN EXPEL MORE CARBON PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY CALOR IS IN COLORS OUT IT'S REALLY CARBON AN CARBON OUT THAT'S THAT'S WHAT A CALORY IS RIGHT CALORIES A MOUNT OF ENERGY WE GET PER BREAKING CARBON BOND SO IT'S REALLY LESS IN LESS MORE OUT LESS IN IS VEIRLY OBVIOUS WHETHER THAT COMES IN ANY FORMAND BY THE WAY THIS IT'S EXACTLY WHY THE PERCENTAGE OF YOUR INTAE COMING FROM FATS OR CAR BEHYDRATE IT SUCH IT DOESN'T EALLY MATTER THAT MUCH IF YOU LOOK AT FAT LOSS CLENICAL TRIALS YOU GETS MADE HAV COVERED THIS WAND LANE WAS IN HERE I'M SURE LIKE THIS IS SOMETHING HE TALKS ABOUT A LOT IT DOESN'T MATTER IS IT'S IRRELEVANTS BECAUSE IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT THERE'S NOTHING MAGIC IN THOSE THINGS THEY ARE DIFFERENT THY HAVE DIFFEREM PHYSIOLOGIC RESPONSES EVERYTHING IS DIFFERENT RIGHT NO DOUT BUT IN GENERAL IT'S SIMPLY ABOUT CARBON AN TIK TURNS OUT FAT HAS A LOT MORE CARBONS PERMOLE THEN CARBAL HYDRATES DO SO THERE'S MORE CALORIES PERMOLE AND THERE SO IF YOU THE PHYSICAL AMOUNT A FAT NEEDS TO COME IN IS SMALLER AMOUNT PHYSICAA MOUNT O CARBHYDRATES HES COMIN I WILL COMEIN IS LARGER AMOUT BUT YOU CAN PLAY ANY NUMBER OF VERY HIGH CARB LO FAT WHAT MATTERS TOTAL CALLORIES YOUR A GET IT'S NOT LIKE THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS PUT Y ON OM SAAND R SOME PERCENTAGES IN THE WAY CAN G FAT LOSS WORKS FANTASTIC HIGH FAT LOW CAR BEHYDRATE WHY WHY WHY THE ALL THE THINGS WORK BECAUS IT'S NT ABOUT THAT IT'S ABOUT TOTALIN TAKE OF CARBON TOLEXVILL SO ABSOLUTELY CAN YOU LOSE FAT BY SIMPLY EXHALING MORE IN FACT THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU DID THIS MORNING WHEN I HOPPED ON THE EAR DINE BIKE WHEN YOU DID ANYTHING RIGHT THE QUESTION IS CAN YOU THNK OF A SENARIO IN WHICH YOU COULD HAVE A BUNCH OF INCREASE RATES OF EXALLATION THAT HELPS AN FALLOWS SURE ANYTHING OF A LOT OF THINGS TOL STIMULATE INCREASE RATES OF INOLEN EXHLLATION ONE THING COULD BE SIMPLY GOING RIGHTIN SO THE CRESIONS LIKE CAN I LITERALLY DO SOME BREATH PROTAL CALLS WHERE I FORCE EXALE AND LOSE FAT AND ANSWERS YES BUT WHAT HAPPENS WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DO HI PEREVENTILATION TRAINING WELL MY LAVE STUDIES SICKLY CYPEEREVENTILATION AS ONE OF OUR MANY A DELIBERATE PROTEN CALLS AND ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT THINGS THAT ONE OBSERVES IS THAT LEVELS OF A DRENDALIN INCREASE VERY QUICKLY EXTREMELY QUICK PEOPLE FEEL GITTERY ANXIOUS TRESS AND UNLESS THEY ARE CONSCIOUSLY TRYING TO ANCHOR THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS AND THE BENEFITS THAT TO PERSISTING TYPICALLY THEY ABORT THE SICKLE CYPER VENTILATION PROTO CALL REALLY QUICKLY WITHIN SECONDS RIT YOU WILL FEEL TINGLING SWETTING ALL KINDS OF THINGS YOU'RE HY PEREVENTILATING RIGHT AND WE COULD WE CA TOCANAUSEUM ABOUT HOW THAT CHANGES EVERYTHING FROM DRALAN TO FOCUS THE WHOLE BUNCH OF THINGS SO UNFORTUNATELY A STRATEGY OF SITTING AROUND JUST EXHALING MORE THAN YOU MIN HAL TACNICALLY HELPS YOU LOSE MORE FAT BUT IT'S NOT GOING THE LAST VERY LON SO THEN THE QUESTION IS WELL HOW DO I GET NO SITUATION OR SENARIO IN WHICH I CAN INCREASE MY RATE OF EXPIRATION WHERE I'M NOT GON TO PASS OUT I'M NOT GOING AN ALL ERING HYPOCAPNEAN I PROCAPNA ISSUES ANY IDEA OF A SITUATION IN WHICH YOU WOULD HAVE AN ENHENCE RATE OF EXEPLATION WITHOUT WERRING ABOUT PASSING OUT TA STEADY STATE EXERCISE OR NOT'S TEADY STATE EXERCISE LIFTING WEIGHTS INTERVALS MODERATE TRAINING REPEATED ANY OF THESE THINGS THEY ALL WORK EQUALLY FOR FAT LOSS BECAUSE ALL THEY'RE DOING IS INCREASING RESPIRATIONARY THEY'RE SAYING INCREASE DEMAN FOR ENERGY INCREASED EXALATION THAT'S THE TRICK HERE AND WHEN YOU QUATE THESE THINGS TO THAT THEY HAVE EQUAL SUCCESS IN FAT LOSS IT DOESN'T MATTER THEORETICALLY WHERE ARE YOU'RE GETTING IT FROM AND SO WHEN WE GET INTO THIS IDEA OF L WHOTE OF THE BEST TRAINING STRATEGIES FOR FAT LOSS IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH ONE OF THESE TACTICS YOU PICK AS LONG AS YOU MAINTAIN CONSISTENT INHERENTS OVER TIME BECAUSE O THIS EXACT FACT IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE BURNING QUOTIN QUOTE FAT IN THE EXERCISE CESSION OR IF YOUR BURNING CARB HYDRATES IN THE EXERCISE SESSION IT IS TOTALLY IRRELEVANT TO YOUR NET FAT LOSS OVER TIME AND NOW THERE'S SOME SIGNIFICANT MISCONCEPTIONS THERE ABOUCH WHAT I JUST TALK AND I WOULD UT VLOVE TO COME BACK AND WALK THROUGH THAT MORE DETAIL BUT THAT'S THE MAIN TAKEO MESSAGE HERE IT WON'T MATTER WHAT'S COMING IN AND IT WON'T MATTER WHAT'S COMING OUT BECAUSE IN EITHER CASE IT IS THE SAME RATE OF OXYGEN IN AND SEEO TO OUT THAT'S THE KEY METRIC AND WHOPEFULLY THIS HELPS A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SOME RELIEF BECAUSE THEYRE LIKE MAN YOU'RE SO TIED UP ON WHAT IS THE EXACT PROTO CALL FOR TRAINING FOR OPTIMIZIN FAT LOSS WHAT'S THE EXACT NUTRITIONAL INTERVENTION I NEED FOR FAT LOSS AND YHN YOU WONDER WHY ALL THESE DIFFERENT DIETS CAN WORK OF FACTIVELY AND WONDER WHY ALL THESE DIFFERENT TRAINING PROLICLES IN O SURELY YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WHO LOSTS TO MUNCH WEIGHT IN THE ONLY THING THEY DID IS THEY JUST STARTED RUNNING THERE WAS NO ADVANCE PROKE TEY JUST RART A RUNNINGANDTHEY RAN FIVE MILES EVERY DAY THAT WORKS AND THEN TOMES OF PEOPLE WHO TRIED THAT N LIKE DID LOWS ANYTHING AND LOT'S PEOPLE WHO WENT TO I WENT TO CARDOCABOX IN CLASS LOST WAI ALL I DISTARTED DOING INTERVALS ON MY  WHY WHY MYSTERIOUSLY OU DO ALL THESE THINGS WORK THERE  THERYOU HAVE SOMETHING HAD SOME SPIDY SENSE HAVE TO HAS TO BE GOING OFF IN YOUR BRAIN WERY LIKE THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING MINKING THESE THINGS AND WHAT'S LINKING IT IS SIMPLY CARBON EXCHANGE SO PUT YOURSELF IN A POSITION IN WHICH YOU ARE EXHALING MORE THAN YOU AND IN HALING WITHOUT PASSING OUT THE OTHER PROBLEM IS IF YOU WERE TO SIMPLY DO A BREATHING PROTOCOL WHILL THE RATE OF EXHALATION WOULD GO UP AFTER THAT YOU WOULD CORRECT AND GO IN THE OPS AT DIRECTION SO THAT'S THE PROBLEM IS YOUR NET CARBON TH OUTPUT OVER THE COURSE THEDAY IS NOT I CHANGE UNLESS YOU INCREASE THE DEMAND FOR ENERGY AND THAT'S HOW YOU GET THAT NEGATIVE STATE ALONG THESE LINES OF EXHALING CARBONS AS THE ROUT FOR FAT LOSS IT MAKES ME WONDER WHETHER OR NOT INCREASING ONE CAPACITY IS POSSIBLE PROMGUSING THE ANSERS YES YO AND WHETH OR NOT INCREASING ONE CAPACITY IS A GOOD GOAL IN ROUTE TO ENHANCING FAT LOST ESSENTIALLY WHAT I MASKG IS IF YOU CAN OFF LOAD MORE SEEO TO THI CATE CARBON IS CUR EXHAL ARE YOU A MORE EFFICIENT FAT LOST MACHINE IT'S A WONDERFUL THOUGHT AND THE ANSWER WOULD BE NOWN NOT SOMETHING YOU WORRY ABOUT BECAUSE IF YOU WERE TO AC SAL MORE CARBON THAN ACTUALLY NEEDED NOW WE'RE IN A STATE OF INEFICIENCEY YOUR BURNING WAY MORE ENERGY THAN NEEDED TO DO YOUR ACTIVITY THE HART HAS A METRIC CALLED CARDIAC OUTPUT THIS IS IN SCIENCES WE APBREVI THIS IS CUE FOR SOME ODD REASONS IS EITHER SEEL OR CUE AND CARDAC AUTPUT IS HARTRATE MULTIPLIED BY STROKE VOLUME SO S TOMMANY BEAS TREMENATE YOUR HAVING AS WELL AS HOW MUCH BLOOD'S COMING OUT OF IT SO CARDIAC OUTPUT IS ACTUALLY VERY SPECIFIC TO ENERGY NEATS IF YOU TRY TO WORK AROUND THAT IT'S JUST GOING TO ADJUST ITSELF SO WHAT I MEAN BY THIS IS IF YOU WERE ABLE TO INCREASE YOUR STROKE VOLUMES THE AMOUNT OF BLOOD COMING OUT PER POMP YOU WOULD AUTOMATICALLY ADJUST TO REDUCE YOUR HEARTRATE SO THAT YOU KEEP CARDAC AUTPUT EXACT TO ENERGETIC DEMANDS SO YOUR SORT OF PUSHING ONE IN THIS OF THE SPECTROM BUT YOUR BODY WILL PULL THE OTHER ONE BACK TO KEEP YOU AT THAT EXACT SAME NEUTRAL AAL SO IM IF YOU LOOK AT IF YOU THINK ABOUT LIKE CARTY OF ASCAR ADAPTATIONS TO ENDURANCE TRAINING AN ANY TYPE OF INDERINS TRAINING A COMMON THING PEOPLE WILL UNDERSTAND IS RESTING HEARTRAHTE AND SO WHAT THAT NUMBER IS IS JUS HOW MANY BEASTS PERMINUTE YOUR HAVING HEN YOU'R SITTIG HARE DOING NOTHING A VERY POSITIVE ADAPTATION IS A LOWERING OF THAT RESTING RATE OVER TIME I'M AS GENERAL NUMBERS WHAT YOU WILL HERE IS PEOPLE WILL SAY THINGS LIKE A A NORMAL RESTING HEARTRATE IS BETWEEN SIXTY TO EIGHTY BEASTS PERMENTET AND YOU KNOW IF ANY OF THE THINGS I'VE TALKED ABOUT IM WITH THE INDIVIDUALS I WORK WITH I DON'T WORK WITH ANYBODY WITH DISEASE JUS TO DE CLARIFY THAT T I DON'T DO ANYTHING WITH DISEASE MANAGEMENT TREATMENT ANYTHING IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE IN A GOOD SPOT WHO WANT A OPTIMIZE OR GET THE NEXT LEVEL WHETHER THIS IS PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES TRYING TO TO PAK FOR PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE OR A THE FOLKS ON OUR RAPID HEALTH OPTIMIZATION PROGRAMME THAT FEEL GOOD AGAINST NOT DISEASED UFF AND A WANT O FEELINCREDIBLE ONE OF THE METRICS WERE EN TO PAY ATTENTION TO IS IS RESTING HARTWRIGHT SO IT HEARS WHAT HAPPENS AS YOU IMPROVE YOUR ENDURANCE YOUR RESTING HEARTWRIGHT WILL GO DOWN IF I SEE SOMEBODY OVER SEVENTY BEAST FOR MINUT A INLESS SOMETHING'S GOING ON YOU'RE NOT PHYSICALLY FIT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT THAT IS GONQUAL WITHIN THE NORMAN OF VALUES I WONT TO SEE EVERYBODY SOME SIXTY BEATS PERMENTT OR CLOTHES RIGHT I'M THAT DOES NOT A DIFFICAL THING TO REALLY GET TO FOR MOST PEOPLE SO IF YOU TRAIN A LOT REGARDLESS OF HOW YOU TRAIN INTERVALS STEADYS SAY DOESN'T MATTER THAT RESTING EARTWRIGHT WILL COME DOWN BUT SINCE ENERGY DEMANDS AT REST HAVEN'T REALLY CHANGED CARDIAC COUTLES STATES IS SAME SO WHAT HAPPENS IS STROKE VOLUME DOES UP SO LITERALLY LIKELY TRAINED YOUR QUADRASTEPTS ON THE LEGISTANTO MACHINE DO GET STRONGER SO YOU CAN PRODUCE MORE FORCE POR CONTRACTION THE HEART WILL DO THE EXACT SAME THING AND SO AS YOU'RE ABLE TO GET MORE OF THE BLOOD OUT OF YOUR HEART PER PUMP THE HEART REALIZES I DON'T NEED TO PUMP IS OFTEN SO THAT'S THE COMPENSATORIA ADAPTATION WHICH IS SAYING HAY LOOK I DON'T NEED TO BEAT SIXTY TIMES A MINUTE I NOW NEED TO BE FIFTY FIVE TIMES A MINUTE BECAUSE I'M GETTING THI SAME AMOUNT OF BLOOD OUT PER PUMP CHILL AND THIS IS WHY YOUR RESTING HARTRATE GOES DOWN YOUR RESTING STROKE VOLUME GOES UP BUT YOUR CARDAC OUTPUT IS IDENTICAL SO THAT'S NOT A GOOD METRIC OF FITNESS IT'S GOING TO STAY THE SAME CARDA ALPOT WILL ONLY A JUST PER ENERGETIC CHANGES I IENERGY REQUIREMENTS IN THE ACUTEMOM RIGHT HOW MUCH DO I NEED GO WHICH IS GOING TO BE DETERMINED BY VENTILATION RIGHT HOW MUCH AIR MY BRINGING IN AN PUTTING OUT THAT'S GOING TO TERMON CARDIAC OUNT PUT AND THAT'S GON TO DETERMINE WERROUT IF YOU WERE TO DO LIKE A SUB MAXIMAL EXERCISE TES WHEN YOU ARE UNFIT TWHEN YOU'RE FIT OR WHEN YU'RE FIT TO WHERE YOU'RE SUPERFIT AT SUB MAX YOU CAN TO SEE THE SAME THING CARDIA CALPIT WILL BE IDENTICAL AND YOU'RE LI DAMN NOTHING HAPPENED BUT YOU'RE NOT REALIZING IS YOUR HEART RATE AT THAT SAME WORK LOAD IS NOW LOWER AND THAT'S SUFFICIENCY BECAUSE YOUR STROKE VOLUME IS HIGRER WHERE IT GETS PEOPLE TRIPPED UP IS THAT MAX BECAUSE YOU MAY NOT SEE A MUCH OF A CHANGE AT MAX I'M BECAUSEYOU WON'T RELEVE YOU DON'T REALLY SEEN INCREASE IN MAXIM HEARTRY WITH FITNESS THAT'S NOT A THING IT SO HAT MAXIM HART RATE IS NOT A GOOD PROXY FOR FIT AR UNFIT ARING LIKE THAT I'M STROKE VOLUME WILL GET LIMITED EVENTUALLY BY FILLING CAPACITY OF YOUR HEART I MAN HAS TO HAVE SO MUCH TIME TO FILL UP WITH BLOOD BEFORE CAN CONTRACTAGAIN AN SQUEEZE THE BLOOD OUT AND WHEN YOU HAVE A HEART RATE IF TWO HUNDRED BEATSMEIN IT THAT JUST DOESN'T LEAVE MUCH TIME TO FILL AND SO IT WON'T REALLY PUSH YOU PASS THAT SO I'M DON'T WORRY ABOUT TRYINGTHE INCREASE OR MAXIMA HEARTRATE IT'S NOT NECESSARILY GOOD THING AND WON'T REALLY CHANGE BUT YOUR CARDIA CALP WILL BECAUSE STROKE VOLUME WILL BE HIRE BUT THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT I SHOULD AVOID TRAINING THAT GETS ME UP TOWARD MAXIMA HARTRA CORRECT OH YOU SHOULD ABSOLUTELY DO IT IHT THAT'S WHAT THAT WAS MY ASSUMPTION I LIKE TO SEE A BRIEF BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE OUR SPONSOR ATHLETIC GREENS ITH LETIC GREENS IS A VITEMIN MINERAL PROBIOTIC AND ADAPTED IN DRINK DESIGN TO HELP YOU MEET ALL OF YOUR FOUNDATION OR NUTRICIONAL NEEDS I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIT GREENS DAILY SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SO I'M DELIGHTED THAT THE RESPONSOR OF THIS PODCAST REASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS IN THE REASON I STILL TAKE OUT LETIC GRENS ONCE OR TWICE O DAY IS THAT IT HELPS ME MEET ALL O MY FOUNDATION OR NUTRITIONAL NEEDS THAT IS IT COVERS MY VITEMENS MY MINERALS END THE PROBIOTICS ARE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO ME ITH LETIC GREENS ALSO CONTAINS A DAPTOGENS WHICH YOURE CRITICAL FOR RECOVERING FROM STRASS FROM EXERCISE FROM WORK OR JUST GENERAL LIFE IF YOU LIKE TO TRY UT LETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO  LETIC GREENSTOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY'LLGIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACK AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU YEAR SUPPLY OF VIT EM IN DEE THREE CAY TO AGAIN IF YOU LIKE TO TRY UT LETIC GREENS GO TO  LETIC GREEN STOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER GETTING BACK TO ENERGY PRODUCTION O MATABOLISM WE GOT THE 'S DIFFERENT MODES OF MOVING ENERGY BUT MAKING AND BREAKING ENERGY BONDS IN THE BODY MOVING ENERGY INTO DFFERENT TISSUES AND OUT OF DIFFERENT ISSUES AND INDEED OUT OF BODY THROUGH EXCELLATION HOW DO EACH OF THESE DIFFERENT MODES OF ENERGY UTILIZATION RELATE TO DIFFERENT MODES OF MOVEMENT AND EXERCISE NOW IN MY MIND I'M STARTING TO DRAW A BRIDGE BETWEEN O CAY WHEN I WALK FOR SIXTY MINUTES YOU KNOW IF I'M TALKING UN BREATHING A BUTE MORE AY BE A BURNING LIOTE MORE FAT AFTER ALL SPEECHES IS A A MODIFIED EXILE A AND MAZIN IF I'M SPRINTING I'M BREATHING DIFFERENTLY AND IF I'M A YOU KNOW DOING A THIRTY MINUTE MODERATE COULDN'TQUIT MODER A JOG BREATHING DIFFERENTLY SO YOU'VE BEAUTIFULLY ILLUSTRATE THIS BRIDGE BETWEEN ENERGY PRODUCTION NUTILIZATION AND CARBONDOXIDE OFF FLOWED THROUGH EXCALLATION WARDERS SOME OF THE SPECIFICS ABOUT ENERGYILIZATION ACCORDING TO DIFFERENT MODES OF EXERCISE AND IF WE COUL BETTER DEFINE MODES OF EXERCISE OR THE OUT TYPES OF EXERCISE THAT TRIGOR SPECIFIC ADAPTATIONS I THINK THIS WHERE THE THE BRIDGE WILL MOVE FROM BEING A A MERE LINE TO A REAL STRUCTURE YE ABSOLUTELY I ONE A LAY ONE MORE FOUNDATIONAL PIECE AND THEN IT'S GOING TO BE MUCH EASIER TO UNDERSTAND THE LIMITATIONS I PUT ON SOME OF THESE TRAINING PROTOCALLS AS WELL AS THE LACK OF LIMENTATIONS ITSUT'S REALYREALLY IMPORTANT THE WAY I WANT O START THIS IS WE HAVE THIS THIS FOUNDATION NOW OF OF CARBON AND AN BASIC ENERGY PRODUCTION THAT'S NOT TO SAY THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE THERE IS AND THAT DIFFERENCE IS IMPORTANT BUT MAYBE WE CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION FROM EARLIER WHICH IS  ACTUALLY WITH SOMETHING YOU ASKED ME THIS MORNING WE WERE EXERCISING LI TRAINING FASTED JUST TRAINING FASTED ENHANDS FALOS AND THE LOGIC IS SOUND IF I DON'T HAVE ANY FUEL THEN I SHOULD BE BURNING MORE FAT THEI'RE FAR I SHOULD BE LOSING MORE FAT IT'S SOUND IT'S NOT TRUE IS IS GREAT IDEA IT'S ONE OF THESE CLASSIC THINGS IN SCIENCE AND EXERCISE FLLI AT PHYSIOLOTY WERE LIKE SOUNDS GOOD TURNS OUT US NOT IT'S ACTUALLY A A PRETTY GROSS MISUNDERSTANDING OF MATABOLISM SO IT'S NOT THE PICK ON THAT TOPIC I DONT RE THE CARE ABOUT THAT TOPIC BUT IT IS A IT'S A COMMON QUESTION IT ALSO GIVES ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO JUST TELL YOU MORE ABOUT MATABOLISM SO HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS YOU ARE BREATHING IN O TO IN BREATHING OUT SE TO HOWEVER THE RATIO TO THAT IS WHAT WE CALL THE EITHER OR WE ARE RESPETORN EXCHANGE RATIOR ARCY RESPITORY QUOTION AND I'M NOT A DIFFERENTIATE THOSE TOO THERE NOT THE SAME THING BUT WERE N TOSGIP PASS AF FOR NOW AS YOU BEGIN TO INCREASE EXERCISE INTENSITY THE PERCENTAGE OF O TO TO SEE O TO RISES IN THE FAVOR OF SEA TO SO YOU START BREATHING OUT WAY MORE SEAL TO THAN YOU ARE BREATHING AND OT TO AND SO IF WE ARE TO LOOK AT THAT NUMBER YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE RELITIONSHIP ECHOES UP SO AT REST MOST PEOPLE HAVE A A A OF A VALUE THAT WE WOULD TIPILARLY CALL SOMETHING LIKE ZEROL POINT SIX  AND THAT'S AGAIN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEN AUGHT TO INSU TO MAYBE ZERIL POINT SEVENT IF YOU WERE TO GO FOR A WALK THAT INCREASES SLIGHTLY BECAUSE YOU'RE NOW EXPIRING SEAL TO AT A HIGHER RATE SO NOW YOU'VE MOVED UP TO SAY POINT ATE IS SOMETHING LIKE THAT ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE MARK SOMEBODY OF ACHIEVING AN ACTUAL VEEL TO MACTS ON A TEST IS IF THAT VALUE EXCEEDS ONE POINT ONE NOW ANY OF YOU WHO ARE PAYING ATTENTION OR THINKING ILL WAIT A MINUTE HOW TO HELL CAN A RATIO BETWEEN TWO THINGS EVER GET PAST ONE WELL THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE GETTING THE PLACE OR YO'RE ACTUALLY WFLOADING MORE SEAL TOO THAN IS ACTUALLY NECESSARY AND THIS IS WHAT ACTALLY CAUSES AN EXPLAINS A THING THAT PEOPLE LIKE TO CALL EPOCH WHICH IS EXCESS EXERCISE POST OXYGEN CONSUMPTION THIS IS ANOTHER WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT THE ONLY REASON YOUR BREATHING IS TO BRING IN OXYGEN WHEN O FLOAD SEALED TO RIGHT IF I'M NO LONGER EXERCISING WHY AM I STILL BREATHINGOTHER WORDS ONCE YOU STOP THE DEMAND OR THE NEED FOR ECT FOR ENERGY YOU SHOULD STOP PENTILATING BUT YOU DON'T RIGHT THAT'S BECAUSE IN THE CASE OF LOW INTENSITY EXERCISE THE SECOND YOU STOP YOU'RE RIGHT BACK DOWN A RESTING VATILATION NO PROBLEM BECAUSE YOU WERE ABLE TO MATCH THE NEED FOR ENERGY WITH THE AF LOAD OF WASTE ONE TO ONE DURING THAT EXERCISE WHEN YOU START CREEPING UP THE INTENSITY YOU CAN'T DO THAT SO YOU HAVE TO BASELY START STEALING A LITTLE BIT OF FUEL HERE SO EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE DONE EXERCISING YOU'RE STILL VENTILATING BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO PAY THAT BACK AND PAY THAT BACK BY THAT I SPECIFICALLY MEAN YOU HAVE TO BRING IN OXYGEN CAUSE YOU HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF WAYS HATS BEEN ACCUMULATING IN YOUR TISSUE THAT YOU'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH AND I'LL WALKE YOU DO WITH THAT WAST IS IT'S A PARTICULAR MOLECULE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE HERD F BUT GROSSLY MISUNDERSTAND SO YOU GOT BUIL HANDLE IT SO THE REASON THAT YOU SOID THING  AND CONTINUED VENTILAT IS BECAUSE YOU'RE NOW TRYING TO PAY BACK THAT EXCESS POST EXERCISE OXYGEN DEBT THAT'S THAT OXYGEN DE WERE SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT RIHT SO THOT BEING SAID AS WE START CRUISING UP THAT AR ACCUSTARTS GOING UP UP UP UP UP UP UP AND IF WE GET TO ONE YOU'RE ONE POINT ALL YOURE YOU'RE IN A LIKE YOU'RE HRTING YOU'RE NAT OUN A PREGED SPOT RIGHT I ET YOU'RE HURDING YOU'RE IN A PRETTY GOOD SPOT YEA WINDOW INTO DOCTOR ANY GAPON'S MIND  A YOU REALLY ONE TO BE SUBJECT CT IN IS A IS LABRATORY YOUR MASSACISTS WARM TO ANDY'S LAB E ABSOLUTELY ALL RIGHT SO THE IDEA THAT I WILL LOSE MORE FAT BY BEING IN AN EXERCISE SITUATION THAT IS BURNING MORE FAT IT SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE BUT IT'S A MASSIV FAILURE TO UNDERSTAND THE METABOLISM IT'S THE EXACT SAME EXPLANATION TO I EXERCISING FASTED DOESN'T MATTER SO THE EXERCISING FAST IT ISSUE UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES IS IRRELEVANT BECAUSE YOU HA V PLENTY OF FUEL IN THE SYSTEM EVEN WHEN YOU HAVENAT EATEN BREAKFAST THAT MORNIG NOW IF YOU'RE TALKING LIKE EXTENDED FASTING OVER MOLTIPLE DAYS THIS IS A DIFFERENCE CIN AREA IF MUSCLE LIKE AGIN LIVERIC LIKE AGEN AND BLOOD GLUCOS ARE AT SUFFICIENT LEVELS THEN YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY TO PERFORM ALMOST ANY TYPE OF EXERCISE THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE DOING NO MAYBE IF YOUR ROB IN YOUR ATMILE TWENTY TO DAY IS A DIFFERENT STORY BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF US HAVE PLENTY OF FUEL SITTING AROUND SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO BURN MORE INTO FAT I'M JUST BECAUSE WE DIDN'T EAT BREAKFAST THAT MORNING SO THAT THIS DOESN'T MAKE ENERGETIC SENSE WE HAVE A LOT OF BACK UP SUPPLIES YOUR NEVER OUT THE TRICK HERE IS THIS IS THERE'S THERE'S A CONCEPT HERE WE CALL CROSS OVER CONSENT SO AS WE ARE STARTING TO MOVE UP EXERCISE INTENSITY WE START BURNING A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF OUR FUEL FROM CARBA HYDRATES AND A LOWER PERCENTAGE OF OUR FUEL COMING FROM FAT I'M SLEEPING THAT'S THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF YOUR FUEL THAT WILL BE COMING FROM FAT OF ANY ACTIVITY YOU COALD EVER DO SO IF THE THEORY THAT I'M IN A STAY AT A LOWER INTENSITY TO BURN MORE FAT WAS TRUE THE OPTIMAL FAT BURNING STRATEGY WOULD THEN BE TO SLEEP THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE OF COURSE IT DOESN'T SO WHY WOULD THEN GOING AT A SLIGHTLY ELEVATED RATE SOMEHOW ALL THE SUDDEN MAGICALLY MAKE YOU LOSE FAT IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY MAKE SENSE WHEN YOU THINK ABY THAT WE ARE LIE OH YET THERE'S NO WAY SO IT'S A PERCENTAGE TRICK IT'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEN ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE THIS IS WHAT THIS CONFUSION IS SO YES AS YOU START DOING LOWER INTENSIED EXERCISE WHETHE YOU'RE FASTERY NOW NOT IT'S IT'S YOUR ELEVANT BUT LOWER INTENS THE EXERCISE A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF YOUR FUEL IS COMING FROM FAT HOWEVER YOU'RE TOTAL FUEL EXPENDITURE IS VERY LOW SO THAT WHOLE TOTAL CARBON BALANCE IS NOT REALLY BEING SHIFTED MUCH AS YOU STARTD EXERCISING AT A VERY HIGH INTENSITY YOU ACTUALLY START GETTING A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF YOUR FUL FROM CARBAHYDRATE A LOWER PERCENTAGE FROM FAT IN FACT AT REST ABOUT THE HIGHEST YOU CAN GET IN MOST PEOPLE IS ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT OF YOUR FUEL FROM FAT AS YOU'RE SLEEPING YOU MIGHT BE SEVENTY PERCENT BUT YOU'LL NEVER BE IN A POSITION EVER NO MATTER WHAT SORT OF THING YOU'VE HEARD AN INERNET YOU'LL NEVER BE IN A SITUATION WHERE FAT IS YOUR ONLY FUEL SOURCE THE HIGHEST OF PROBABLY EVER SEENE IS LIKE SEVITY PERCENT I'M YOU SHOULD PROBABLY BEAT ABOUT THAT'S THAT'S A KIND OF A GOOD NUMBER TO THINK I'M HONESTY BUT PEOPLE WILL WHO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT AMOUT MATAS TABL ISM TO BE DANGEROUS BUT NOT ENOUGH WE'LL WE'LL THROW OUT THESE TERMS LIKE FAT ADAPTED IN FAT ADAPTED IS A REAL THING BUT IS A MASSIVE MISUNDERSTANDING OFTEN TIMES RIGHT IT IS THIS IDEA THINKING LIKE I CAN GET IN A SPOT WHERE I'M MAXIMIZING FAT BURNING MAXIMIZING FAT BURNING AND MAXIMIZING FAT FOR EXERCISE AND MAXIMIZING FAT LOSS OVER TIME ARE NOT THE SAME THING AT ALL RIGHT THAT'S THE CONFUSION SO IF YOU ENHANCE FAT OXIDATION AND EXERCISE THAT DOES NOT ENHANCE FAT LOSS BER SAY RIGHT SO THIS IS THE LOT OF THE CONFUSION AS HAPPENING RIGHT SO AS WE START MOVING UP WE CAN NEVER GET IN A POSITION WHERE WE'RE USING FAT ONLY AS A FUEL AGAIN AT BEST YORA SEVENTY PER CENT FAT THIRTY PER CENT CAR BEHYDRE FOR LOT OF REASONS WE PROVETIES ON HAT TIME TO GET INTO HOWEVER THE OPPOSITE IS POSSIBLE WHEN YOU GET INTO TRUE HIGH INTENSITY EXERCISE YOU'LL BE BASICALLY ONE HUNDRED PER CENT CAR BEHYDRATE AND ZEREL PER CENT FAT IGHT THAT IS IS VERY POSS WIT THAT IN FACT IS ONE POINT OUT THAT'S HAT ARCU ONE POINT ONE IS ACTUALLY BECAUE YOUR VENTILATION GOT SO HIGH YOU ACTUALLY EXCEED O THAT NUMBER EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE AT A HUNDRED PER CENT AR HYDRAT THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE CAME UP THE IDEA THAN IS LIKE WOOLL I DO'T ANT AO BURN CARBS IO WOE TO LOOSE FAT SO MY RESPONSE THAT IS ALWAYS LIKE OKET GRATE SO MAKE SENSE BURNING FAT LOSING FAT BURNING CARBS IS LOSING WHAT THEN THET YOUTTIN YOU'R LIVER SHRUNK LIKE THE GOITOMEN WHAT DID YOU LOSE THAT WHERE TO COME FROM IT'S ALL COMING AS CARBON DON'T WORRY ABOUT WHERE IT CAME FROM FOR YOUR FUEL IT JUST HAS TO COME OUT AS CARBON IT THEREARE DIFFERENCES IN EXERCISE EFFICIENCY FOR PERFORMANCE WITH OUR PROFESSIONAL ATLETES OF COURS BUT IF THE ONLY GO HERE IS FATLAS IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU GET IT FROM THE LAST BRIDGE WE HAVE TO CONNECT HERE IS LIKE E WITAMEN IF I ONLY BURNED CAR BOHYDRATE HOW DID I ACTUALLY LOSE THAT FAT THERE WAS THAT THERE WAS THAT LOVE HANDLE SITTIG ON THE SIDE OF ME HOW DOD THAT COME OUT OF ME BY NEVER BURNED THAT FROM OUR FUEL WHAT YOU'R FAILING TO UNDERSTAND IS THERE'S A BALANCE CAME THAT HAPPENS HERE SO IF YOU'RE TO DO A BUNCH OF HIGH INTENSITY EXERCISE TRAINING AND YOU BURNED ONLY MUST LOOK LIKE A GIN AND BLOOD GLOOV GOES AND MAYBE EVEN YOU DID IT FOR SO LONG YOU BURN SOME LIVERIC LIKE A GEN THE BODY UNDERSTANDS THAT IT IS EXPEL THE LOT OF ENERGY FROM THAT SIDE OF THE EQUATION IT'S GOING TO DO A COUPLE OF THINGS NOW IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GO THROUGH THIS FANCY SITUATION WHERE YOU CONVERT CAR BEHYDRATES IN TO FAT AND BACK AND FORTH LIKE THAT'S ACTUALLY LIKE FAIRLY HARD WHAT'S EASIER TO DO WITH SOMETHING YOU SAID EARLIER IS ECTUALLY JUST BYAS ENERGETICS TO A DIFFERENT FUEL SOURCE SO IN THAT SENAREO WHERE YOU'R DOWN REALLY LOW IN YOUR CAR BEOHYD I CAR BEHYDRATE STORES ANY CAR BEHYDRATES YOU BRING IN AR GOING TO GO TO STORAGE AND SINCE YOUR NAT ENERGY EXPENDITURE IS SOMETHING THAT YOUR BODY REGULATES LOT ANY FAT THAT YOU THAN BRING IN IS GOING TO BE UTILIZED AS A FUEL SOURCE BECAUSE IT KNOWS IT DOESN'T NEED IT ANY MORE THAT IS IN ACCESS SO THAT'S HOW YOU ACTUALLY USE FAT AS A FUEL BECAUSE YOU'VE BURNED DOWN CAR BEHYDRATE STORAGES AS I'M HEARING THIS A A COUPLE OF THINGS COME TO MY FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR THAT INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT DESCRIPTION OF WHAT IS OTHERWISE A VERY CONFUSING LANDSCAPE FROM MOST PEOPLE ONE OF THE KEEP ONCE I TOOK AWAY AND I JUS ONE SAY FROM THE OUTSET THIS IS NOT EXHAUSTIVE BY ANY STRETCH IS THAT BURNING FAT DOS NOT EQUAL LOSING FAT FROM THE BODY CORRECT AND THEN BURNING FAT HAS TO BE DIVIDED INTO BURNING OF BODY FAT STORES AND WE NEED TO DISTINGUISH THAT FROM BURNING OF DIETARY FAT THAT IS BROUGHT IN OFTENTIMES PEOPLE DON'T DISAMBIGUATE THOSE CORRECT I AND I'VE ALSO UNDERSTANDING THAT REDUCING ONE'S BODY CARBHYDRATE STORES MUSCLE LIKAGIN LIVERGLAKAGEN ET CETERA OCCURS DURING HIGH INTENSITY EXERCISE YET CILLS OTHERWAYS BUT THAT IS ONE VERY EFFICIENT WAY TO TAP INTO THOSE STORES WHICH MAKES ME WONDER AN THIS  ONE THESE THINGS THE DOES IT LEAD TO A PROTOCALL MAKES ME WONDER WHETHER R NOT DOING HIGH INTENSITY LIT'S A WAIGHT TRAINING FOR FORTY FIVE TO SIXTY MINUTES SEVENTY FIVE MINUTES OF STRENGTH TRAINING POWER TRAINING HYPERTOF RETRAINING WHICH WE'VE COVERED IN AN EPISODE ABOUT THOSE TOPICS AND THEN DOING SOME STEADY STATE CARTIVASCULAR EXERCISE IS THERE ANY BENEFIT TO THAT ARRANGEMENT THAT WOULD QUOTIN QUOTE INHANCS BODY FAT LOSS FROM THE BODY THRO VERY PICIY NOW BECAUSE UNLIKE THE IDEA THAT TRAINING FASTED WOULD SHIFT THE BIST TOWARDS FAT LOSS WHICH IT DOESN'T YOU'VE TOLD US UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS MUSCLED LIKAGIN AND MAYBEVEN LIVERGLIKAGEN IS GOING TO BE TEPLEADED BUT SIMPLY CAN I ENHANCE BODY FAT LOSS BY DOING SOME CARDIO AFTER A BOUT OF WAIGHT TRAINING IF YOU EQUATE FOR TOTAL ENERGY EXPENDITURE IN WON'T MATTER NOW YOU DID BRING UP A VERY IMPORTANT POINT THAT I WONT CLARIFY IF YOU LOOK AT THE EXERCISE MODALITIES THAT WE LAID OUT IN OUR PREVIOUS A CONVERSATIONS WE TALKED ABOUT NINE DIFFERENT ADAPTATIONS ONE WAS SKILL AND IN SPEED POWER STRENGTH HYPERTRAPHE MUSCULAR ENDURANCE ANEROB CAPACITY AROBA CAPACITY AND LONGDRATION ATDRNS NOW SPEED POWER AND SKILL DEVELOPMENT HAVE ALMOST NO BENEFIT FOR FAT LOSS BECAUSE REMEMBER THOSE ARE LOW WEIGHT A LOT OF REST AND LOW VOLUME THEY'RE NOT REALLY REALLY GOING TO BE HELPFUL YOU COAN MAKE A LITTLE BIT OF A CASE FOR STRENGTH A LITTLE BIT BUT THE TOTAL ENERGY EXPENDITURE FOR STRANGH TRAINING EVEN IF ITS ANT HOUR IF IT'S TRULY STRAINGT TRAINING IT'S FAIRLY LOW BECAUSE THE REPETITIONS ARE IN THE ONE TO THREE RAINGE IT'S EXACT IT'S NOT OT FOR TOTAL WORK SO IF YOU ARE TRYING TO DEVELOP A PROTOCALL THAT SORT OF OPTIMIZES FAT LOSS WHICH YOU WANTO DO YOU WRE CLOSE AN MY OPINION IS DO A COMBINATION OF SOMETHING IN THE HYPERTOPHY SLASH MUSCULAR ENDURANCE STRENGTH TRAINING ROUND O CISO A SIX TO THIRTY REPETITIONS SOMETHING LIKE AN RESISTANCE TRAINING GREAT DEPLETE MUSCLE LIKE A GIN MAY EVEN A BIT OF LIVERIC LIKAGEN MAY BE A LITTLE BIT DEPENDING ON IF YOUR DOING IT FOR LONG TIME BUT PROBABLY NOT A NOTICEABLE AMOUNT O CASE TO AN HOUR O OF A HYPRTORE TYPE TRAINING IF YOIF YOU'RE TRAINING HARD WITH LOW RESTERALS AND YOU REALATED AN HOUR YOU OULD FOR SURE GET THERE BUT MOST PEOPLE DON'T CAUSE I THE REASON RY I CRAVE LARGE BOLLS A ROAT MEALIN RISE AFTER I DO WAG DRAININ YEV PLATTISH MUSCLED LIKEAGEN TOTAL RIGHT AM THEN YOU MAY BE DO A LIVBIT OF VERY HIGH INTENSITYGUE MAXIM HART RIGHT WELL OVEREVEALED TWO MACTS A HARD AS YOU CAN FOR TWENTY THIRTY FORTY FIVE SIXTY SECONDS SOMETHING LIKE THAT WITH SOME RE COVERY A LOT OF RE COVERY AND REPEATED AND THAT'S GOING TO A GREAT JOB OF DEPLUNISHING MUSCLE LIKE AGEN RIGHT IF YOU DO THAT LONG ENOUGH YOU'LL GET THE LIVER BUT AGAIN MOST PEOPLE DON'K AS IS REALLY REALLY HARD TO GO THAT HARD SO LIVER IS FOR A LAST LASTER ESORT YE BASIC MECHANICS HERE WHICH  WHICH WL ACTUALY GETTINTO AS ARE LIKE THIRD SAGMENT HERE IS A ENERGY PRODUCTION COMES FROM E LOCAL LEXERCISING MUSCLE FIRST AND FOREMOST FROM PHOSPHER CREECING AND CARBA HIDRATE STORES INSON AGAIN AN WE STORE IN A MUSCLWE CALL IT LIKE AGEN RIGHT THAT'S US YOUR FIRST SIGN AT LIGHT OF DEFENCE IF YOU NEED GLUCOS OUTSIDE OF THAT YOU CAN A STRUT PULLING IT FROM THE BLOOD BUT ONE OF THE THINGS YOUR BODY REGULATES A HANDFUL OF THINGS OVER ALMOST EVERYTHING BLOOD P H BLOOD GLUCOS BLOOD PRESSURE AN ELECTORO LIKE CONCENTRATIONS LIKE IT REALLY DOES NOT WANT A MUSCLET THOSE THINGS AT ALL IT WILL CHANGE ALMOST ANYTHING ELSE IN THE BODY TO KEEP THOSE THINGS STANDARD IYES RIGHT YOU GENERALLY BECAUSE YOU NEED ALL THOSE THINGS FOR YOUR BRAIN TO WORK AND YOUR BRAIN WIL STOP WORKIN RGHT IF YOU LOSE BOOD PRESSURE MOLT GO UP THERE P H CHANGES YOU CANT RUN METABLISM ELECTROLIGHES CHANGE YOU CAN'T THINK AND GLUCOS IS A PRIMARY FEEL SORCS FOR THE BRAIN IT'S GON O BEUR PROBLEM RIGHT SO IF THAT NUMBER STARTS TO COME BYOWND BECAUE YOU'RE RABING GLUCOS OUT O THE BLOOD YOUR LIVER IS GONG TO THEN KICK GAN IT'S GONE A BREAK DOWN IT'S LIKE AGIN TO PUT GLUCOS AND OF BLOOD TO KEEP THE BLOOD NUMBER THE LEVEL IN FACT ONE OF THE TINGS YOU'LL SEE IT'S BLOOD GLUCOES CONSTRATIONS RISE DURING HEC PER CIDES THEY DON'T FLALL IN FACT THEY RISE A AS AN ANTICIPARY STATE IF YOU TRAIN A LOT YOUR BOOD COS WILL TRIKE GOING UP BEFORE YOU START MOVING IT KNOWS ITS COMING RIGHT SO YOU YOU CAN PLAY THAT GAME YOU CAN ROB PETER TO PAY PAUL FOR A LONG TIME AND TELL YOUR LIVER RUNS OUT AND THAT'S WHAT ACTUALLY IS A BONK AND TRMS A LIKE LONG DURATION AND DURAN STUNT YOURE TRACKING MANY MANY MANY MILES SEVERAL HOURS TYPICALLY WE SAY OH IT'S GOT TO BE OVER TWO HOURS I'M BEFORE YOUR LIVER STARTS TO BECOME A REAL PROBLEM OR IT HAS TO BE TREMENDOUSLY INTENTS BECAUSE THOSE REASONS YOU HAVE TO BURN THROUGH JUST A LOT OF ENERGY BEFORE YOUR LIVER STARS TO GET TO A PROBLEM YOU CAN CONTINUE TO TRAIN WHEN YOUR MUSCLEK LIKE AGIN LEVELS ARE LOW IN FACT IM PEOPLE SAKE LIKE O DO NTO PLETION A MUSCLE BUT IT'S AT IT'S GENERALLY MIS NOMER YOU ARE GOING TUS HAVE TREMENDOUS SIGNALS OF FATIGUE WHEN THAT NUMBER GETS LOWER THAN SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT SO BE BETHING TO LIKE THEIR MUSCLES ARE ETTING HEAVY YOURE YOUR PROBABLY STILL SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT FUL I'M A LOT OF FOLKS WILL CILK QUIT AROUN THE FIFTY PER CENT THE HIGHEST I'VE EVER SEEN IS LIKE NINETY FIVE PER CENT TRUE TO PLECION AND THAT'S IN EXTREMELY HIGH LEVEL CROSS COUNTRY SPEERS AND LIKE THEIR DELTOIT IT'S VERY VERY LOW SOME VERY TOWNS THROUGH RUNNERS WILL GET FAIRLY LOW IN THEIR CLODS BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF FOLKS BY THE TIME YOU'RE FIFTY PER CENT TO PLEADED YOU'RE GOT QUET IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY REALLY CHALLENGING I'M SO YOU'RE NEVER REALLY GOING TO GET THAT LOW IT I'S LIKE A BIT OF A PROTECT IVE MECHANISM RIGHT BUT WHEN YOUR LIVER GETS LOW YOU'RE GON TO BE SHUT DOWN AND NASS THE CASE OF WI YE EVERBEN LIKE A MARITHON ANDYOU'VE SEEN PEOPLE RUN LIKE TWENTY FIVE AND A HALF MILES AND THAT IT'S LIKE BUNK THEY GOING TO LIKE BABY DEAREST WALKING STANDS IN THIN THA COLLAPSE AND YOU LIKE HOW YOU MENTALLY WEK LIKE YOU RAN TWENTY SIX MILES ANDYOU CAN'T RUN THE LAST POINT AN AN' MENTALLY WEAK IT IS IF YOUR LIVER IS DONE IT'S GON A STOP YOU CAUSE THERE'S NO MORE BACK OT PRESERVES MUSCL YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH YOU COULD PUSH THROUGH IT LIVER WILL NOT LET YOU GO ANY FARTHER I FIND THIS FASTINING BECAUSE IT MAKES ME WONDER WHETHER OR NOT THE LIVER BEING TO PLEATED SENDS A NURAL SIGNAL TO THE BRAIN O AT SLOR HERE THE BRAIN MUST REGISTER SOME SIGNAL LIKE I WOULD LIKE TO BE A LIVE TO MORROW THANK YOU WHATEVER IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AM STOPPING IS GOING TO BE SAFER THAN CONTINUING YAND SO THAT STOP SIGNAL AM IS IT IS ONE THAT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF OR ARE INTRIGUE BY BECAUSE WE AWAYS THINK THAT IT'S A RELATE TO WILL POWER BUT THE BRAIN NEENS TO PRESERVE ITSELF AND AS THE MASTER COMPUTER I MEAN THERE ARE WAYS TO GO INTO KIND OF AUTOMATONTYPE IM YET A NOT THINKING JUST DOING TIP A BEHAVIOUR YOU HAVE OVERIDE SWITCHIS RIGHT AND YOU CAN PLAY THOSE CARDS AND YU CAN GET BETTER AT LEARNING AND BE BEING LESS SENSITIVE TO THAT SWITCH THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPEN YOU FIRST AUR TRAINING RIGHT OU TR TO REALIZE LIKE ALL MY GOSHONS TO PERETIRE THAN YOU REALY T LOOK QICK LIKE   TOTALLY FINE ER AND THIS IS LIKE THEM PICK PICK PICK YOUR PERSON WHO'S MADE SANGS LIKE THIS BUTS LIKE YOURE REALLY ONLY TEN PER CENTO PLATED OR THIRTY PER CENT OR FORTY PER CENT R SOME RALL OPERATING FORTY PER CENTALY I COULD DO OF COURSE ANY THOSE THINGS ARE TRUE BECAUSE IT IS LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF AN OVERRIDE I'M YOU'VE JUST GOTTEN VERY SENSITIVE TO BEING A SMALL PER CENTES TO PLEADED AND YOU'VE LEARNED O CAMP TIRED AND THERE IS A LONG WAY TO GO PAST THAT BUT ONCE YOU GET PAST THAT AND YOU SLIP THAT OVERIDE SWITCH A LOT IM YOU JUS YOU'RE GING TO BREAK QUICKLY BECAUSE YOU'VE YOU BASELY LEARNED IGNOR THAT SIGNAL AND PROBLEMS CAN HAPPEN REALLY QUICKLY AFTER THAT AND THAT'S EVEN EXPERIENCE AND DURN SNATHINGS IF YOU HIT THAT LEVEL LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO BE HITTING THE CONCRETE NEXT THAT'S NT PRETENCE THEY ARE PROBLEM I WANT TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND A CONCEPT THAT YOU REFER TO EARLIER CORRECTLY BECAUSE I'VE A FEELING THAT I DON'T AND THAT'S THIS ISSUE OF HOW THE BODY ACCESS IS BODY FAT STORES WHEN IN A SUB COLORIC STAY AND I'M DOING MAINLY LIKE IGEN BURNING EXERCISE YWHAT I HEARD YOU SAY AND PLEASE CORRECT ME WHERE I'M UNDOUBTEDLY WRONG WHAT I HEARD YOU SAY WAS THAT O CAY I GO IN TO THE GIM AND I START LIFTING WAIGHTS I'M BURNING MUSCLE LAKAGEN MOSTLY LOCAL TO THE MUSCLES THAT AMUSING AND THEN I START PULLING GLACAGEN FROM THE BLOOD STREAM MAYBE THERE'S SOME BODY FAT STORES THAT OR MOBLE IES PROBABLY NOT DIPPING IN TO MY LIVER LAKAGEN O RET HE COMPLETE THE WORK OUT MAYBE I EVEN HOP ON THE AIRDINE BY CAN DO WILL SPRINT YE EGOPHOR JOG MAYBE UM I E IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARD MAYBE I DON'T EAT FOR A FEW HOURS AFTERWARDS BUT ACROSS THE DAY I INJEST FEWER CALLORIES THEN I BURN IS IT THE CASE THAT BODY FAT IS MOBILIZED IN ORDER TO REPLACE THE GLAKAGEN THAT MY SUB CLORIC INTAKE WAS INSUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE IN OTHER WORDS BECAUSE I DIDN'T EAT ENOUGH TO FILL THE GLIKEAGE IN STORES IN I USING BODY FAT CONVERTED INTO GLAKAGEN TO FILL THOSE STORES RIGT AND IF SO IS THAT A CASE WHERE I'M NO LONGER EXHALING CARBONS IN ORDER TO BURN BODY THOUGHT T RATHER I'M REPURPOSING BODY FAT INTO MUSCLE HAVE I TURNED FAT INTO MUSCLE IN THAT CASE YE I'M I'M RALLY GLAD A YOU ASK US BECAUSE I DID A VERY POOR JOB ON THAT LAST POINT TALKING ABOUT EARLHIER I'M REALIZING PLAYING BACK O MY HEAD TCAS IS TAS SO MANY RETLGOOD QUESTIONS YOU CANNOT TURN FAT INTO MUSCLE CAN YOU TURN MUSCLE INTO FAT NO I'M SO GLAD YOU SAID THAT BECAUSE WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE YET OUR I DON'T WANT IT OUT THAT PERSON THE PHYSIOLOGY TEACHER SEEM TO THINK STILL AT THAT POINT O THAT ONE COULD UM LIFT WAY TO GET MUSCULAR BUT THEN IT WOULD EVENTUALLY TURN INTO BODY FEATHIT THAT I THAT MITHAS I THINK LARGELY BEEN DISPELLED I HEARD THAT SO MANY TIMES AS HA KID I HEARD IT SO MANY TIMES IN COLLEGE I HEARD IT SO I HERE SO MANY TIMES IN HOUR UNDERGRADUAL STUDENTS FROM OTHER FACULTYN AND SAT SO UM NO THTHEARE NOT THE SAME STRUCTURES THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT UM LET MIEME TATIO OUT AN ANSWERING THIS BETTER YOU WERE REALLY REALLY REALLY CLUBS SO YE IF YOU WERE TO DO THAT TYPE OF EXERCISE WE'VE BURNED A LOT OF MUSSLOOK LIKE AGEN HOW IS IT I'M LOSING STORED FAT  THAT'S RUALY THE CLUKS THE QUESTION AND IT DOESN'T EVEN ACTUALLY MATTER IF YOU THEN WENT AHEAD AND INJESTED ECTRA A CARBOHYDRATES OR FAT POST EXERCISE THAT'S NOT REALY THING YOU HAD ON A COUPLICY THINGS NO ER ONE THIS IS ALL ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT TOTAL CLORIC AN TAKE IS STILL LO RIGHT YOU HAVE A TOTAL NEED BELOW TOVERY REC I ALSO WON A FLAG CALORIES IN CALORIES OUT IS NOT THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS THIS IS A VERY COMPLEX THAN CALORIES AND IS INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED CALORIES OUT IS EVEN MORE COMPLICATED CAM SO WE JUST MAYBE ANOTHER A SERIES WE CAN SPEND ON THAT ALONE I SO DON'T DON'T GO NUTS ABOUT THAT YOU HAVE TO BE HYPOCHLORIC ONE WAY OR THE OTHER IF YOU BURN A MUCH A MUSSLOOK LKE AGEN AND YOUR HYPER CLORIC YOU'RE STILL GOING TO AT FAT IF YOU BURN A MUNCH MUSSLOOK LIKE AGEN AND YOUR HYPO CLORIC YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE FAT T THINK ABOUT THIS WAY YOU ARE IN A NEGATIVE CALORY STAKE WHERE ARE THOSE CALORIES GOING TO COME FROM ARE YOU GOING TO REDUCE YOUR MUSCLIK LIKEAGEN STORAGES PERMANENTLY NO NO ARE YOUEN A R REDUCE YOUR GLICOGEN SORGIN YOR LIVER NO YOU ANT TO REDUCE BLUGLICOS NO NO WAY RIGHT SO WHERE IS THAT ETRA ENERGY COMING FROM IT'S COMING FROM YOUR STORED FAT IT IS YOUR BACK UP RESERVE ENERGY SYSTEM IM THE WAY THAT I WANT O FLI THIS ERES PEOPLE TEND TO THINK ABOUT IT IS LIKE CARBOHYDRATES VERSES FAT THAT'S NOT IS IT'S MORE LIKE A CHAIN MORE LIKE A BICYCLE WHERE THERE'S A FRONT GERE AND A BACK HERE YOU TURN ONE GEAR IT TURNS THE OTHER ONE THESE OUR COMPLIMENTARY SYSTEMS THEY ARE NOT AND OR SYSTEMS RIGHT YOU'RE YOUR TURNING ONE AND WHEN WE GO THROUGH CARBOHYDRATE METABOLISM I MAY BE HERE IN A SECOND YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHY YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN ANEROBIC ANNOROBIC OMPONENT TO THAT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY TO COMPLETE CARBOHYDRATE METABOLISM WITHOUT OXYGEN THAT HAT'S TO HAPPEN THE ONLY WAY TO ENGAGE IN FATMETABOLISM IS EROBIC ANOXIDEN THERE'S NO ANTEROBIC OMPONENT TO IT THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE THERE SO THE YOUR CARBOHYDRATES ARE MEANT TO BE INCREDIBLY FLEXIBLE AT I'S THE PRIMARY FUEL SOURCE FOR A REASON YOUR FAT IS NOT MEANT TO BE FLEXIBLE IT ISN'T MEANT TO BE UNLIMITED THAT'S THE BASIC POINT SO YOU WANT FLEXIBILITY OVER HERE AND AN UNLIMITED CAPACITY VER THERE NOW I'M SAFE GARDED AGAINST ANY ENERGETIC NEED GE I NEED TO RUNT UP A HILL FOR SAFETY COOL CARBAHYDRATES ER THERE I NEED TO THEN RUN FOR SEVENTEEN HOURS COOL FAT IS THERE WE WANT BOTH THESE SYSTEMS I YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE GREATE ENERGY THROUGHOUT THE DAY YOU WANT A SLOW DRIP COMING FROM FAT YOU DON'T WANT UP AND DOWN UP AND DOWN HO GREAT UP AND DOWN OSSOM YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO THINK VERY QUICKLY GET HYPROFOCUS BOOM CARBAHYDRATES RAMPRIGHT UP RIGHT GET IT INTO THE BRAIN GET THINKING BETTER THEY THINKING CLEARLY FASSO WEU WANT ALL THESE NOT JUST RECTROCIZE PURPOSES BUT FOR ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING WE WANT A OPTIMAL SYSTEM HERE AND WHEN PEOPLE O USE THE TERMS LIKE FAT ADAPTED THEY'RE GENERALLY HYJACKING THAT AN THINKING MACIT USED TO BE A THING WE SET ALL THE TIME AND LIKE ALL MY UNDERGRADUATE CLASSES FOR YEARS AND THAT IDEA OF METABOLIC FLEXIBILITY IS USING OPTIBLE FUEL SOURCES ANDOPTIMALE TIMES NOT MAXIMIZING FAT USAGE THEY THE PEOPLE OF COLL OP TO THAT TERM A METABLE IFFLEXIBILITY TO BE LIKE OIEA THEREFORE LEARN HW TO MAXIMAS FATBRING THAT'S NOT WHAT THAT TERM MEANS THAT TERM MEANS MAXIMIZING YOUR ABILITY USE WHATEVER FEELIS OPTIMALE IN THAT TIME NOW I GRANT YOU MOST PEOPLE AREN'T FANTASTIC IT USING FATAS O FUEL SOURCE RELATIVE TO THE OTHER DIRECTION BUT NONETHLESS T THAT E THE GOLDSTANDAR HERE SHOULD BE MAXIMIZING BOTH RIGHT FINALLY ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION IF IWERE  TO BURN ABOUTSAMUSO LIKEAGEN HOW AM I LOSING THAT FAT WELL THE FULYOUR INJESTING IN THAT HYPOCHLORIC STAY IS GOING TO SAY HAY LOOK WE HAVE A LOT OF MUSCL LIKE AGIND WE HAVE TO REPLENISH SO ANY CARBOHYDRATE THAT COMES IN NEEDS TO BE BYASD TOWARD STORAGE IT'S GOT TO GO IN TO THOSE TISSUE ANY FAT THAT COMES IN OR DOESN'T EVEN COME IN BUT ANY FAT THAT WERE USING FOR FUEL NEEDS TO BE UTILIZED FOR ACTIVITY AND THAT'S HERE THE COLORIC EXPENDITURE FROM FAT COMES IN SO YOUR BASELY SAYING YOUR GENERAL PHYSIOLOGY STHE ENERGY FOR THAT STARTES COMING FROM FAT AND THE ENERGY THAT'S COMING IN FROM CARBA HYDRATE NEEDS TO BE SIMPLY STORED AND SO YOU SEE IS YOUR RESPIRATORY CUTION CHANGES RIGHT THERE ARE IAR IS GOING IS GOING OFF AND SO IN THE EXERCISE MOMENT IT'S SHOT WAY UP FOR CARBOHYDRATES AND SHOT WEIGH DOWN FOR FAT AS THE COPENTISTORY RESPONSE IT GOES THE OTHER DIRECTION BECAUSE YOUR BODYS SAYING WE ARE LOW ON CARBA HYDRATES DON'T USE THEM FOR FUEL UNLESS WE ABSOLULY HAST YOUR WRITE SO USE THEM FOR STORAGE GET OUR FUEL FROM THE FAT SIDE THE EQUATION AND SO WHAT YOU'RE GENERALLY GOING TO SAY IS LIKE OH I'M BURNING MORE FAT TO SITTING AROUND AFTER THINGS LIKE THAT AND THAT'S NOT EVEN TAKING INTO THE EQUATION THE EPOCH PART WHICH IS LIKE IS IT'S NOT ACTUALLY IS LARGE AS PEOPLE THINK IT IS IT'S FAIRLY SMALL BUT IT IS IT ADDS UP SORT OF OVERTIME SO I'M DOES THAT EXPLAYING A A BIT BETTER ABOUT HOW YOU LOSE FAT WHEN YOU ACTUALLY ONLY BURN CARBES FOR EXERCISE IF YOU EXPLAINED IT BEAUTIFULLY YOU TALKED ABOUT EPOCH THE POST EXERCISE OXYGEN CONSUMPTION YET NOTHING THAT SIGNIFICANT IN TERMS OF ENERGILIZATION EVEN THOUGH TO DAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ENDURANCE IN DIFFERENT FORMS OF ENDURANCE I DO HAVE TO ASK WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE CONSIDER THE ELEVATION IN BASIL METABOLISM THAT OCCURS WHEN THERE'S MORE MUSCLE AROUND YOU BECAUSE MUSCLE IS SUCH A METABOLICALY DEMANDING TISSUE UM YOU KNOW IF IS THERE A STRAIGHTFORWARD ISS EQUATION YOU KNOW IF ONE ADDS ONE POUND OF OF UNLAN MUSCLE TISSUE TO THEIR BODY EVEN IF IT'S DISTRIBUTED ACROSS MULTLE MUSCLE GROUPS DOES THAT EUAIT TO A A COLORIC NEED OF EX NUMBER OF CALLORIES PER DAY AND IS THAT BECAUSE OF THE MUSCLE PROTIN SYNTESIST MEADS OF THAT MUSCLE OR IT'S GLIKAGEN STORAGE NEEDS WERE BOTH IF YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MUSCLE YOU START TO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH FAT LOSSES IT'S DIFFICULT CHALLENGE IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH MUSCLE AND YOU'RE DIST TRYING TO GET EXTREMELY LARGE IF YOU FEAR EF OFE MICE TWENTY FOUR IN YOUR FIFTEEN PERCENT BODY FAT ADDING MORE MUSCLES NOT REALLY IN A PLAYLIGHT IN EQUATION AND HERE'S WHY MUSCLE IS MORE METABOLICALLY ACTIVE AT REST THAN FAT BUT FAT IS NONE AN ERT SO FAT IS STILL GOING TO BURN A SMALL NUMBER OF CALLORIES MUSCLE BURNS MORE BUT IT'S NOT NEARLY WHAT PEOPLE THINK IT IS I'M A MUSCLE GUY I'M A MUSCLE PHYSIOLOGIST I WOULD LOVE TO GET PEOPLE TO HAVE MORE MUSCLE FOR ANY EXCUSE I CAN IT'S NOT HONEST TO SAY THAT THOUGH I'M YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHEN I WAS IN UNDERGRAD DOIT WE WOULD SAY NUMBERS LIKE FIFTY CAKCOLS PER DAY PRPOUND IS WHAT YOU CAN LOOK AT RI SO IF YOU PUT ON A A POUND O MUSCLES SPREAD ACROSS THE BODY YOUR BASE OMETABOLIC RATE WOULD GO UP BY ROUN FIFTY CALLORIES I'M PER DIC I THINK THAT NUMBERS GROSS EXAGGERATED IT'S PROBABLY ATTENT OF THAT SIX TO TEN ALLORIES MAYBE IM IT'S IT'S HAR TO NO EXACTLY WHAT THAT NUMBER IS BUT THE MORE RECENT ESTIMATES ARE  SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO NOW ON ONE HAND YOU COULD SAY ALL MY GOSH THAT IS NOT EVEN MEANING FUL THITHER HAND YOU COULD SAY THAT SUPERMEANINGFUL IS THIS DEPENDS ON TIME DOMAN YOU WANT O PUT THAT OUTRIGHT SO F YOUARE TO PUT ON FIVE POUNDS OF MUSCLE AND YOUR MAZES A METABOLIC RATE WHEN A THIRTY OR FORTY CALLORIES A DAY WELL OVER THE COURSE OF A THOUSAND DAYS THE THAT ACTUALLY HOUDS UP SO YOU EGE SLICES ANY WAY YOU WANT UM NOW MAYBE THAT NUMBER SOMMER BETWEEN I DON'T REALLY KNOW 'S NOT A FEELD I PAY THAT MUCH ATTENTION TO CANDIDLY BECAUSE I IT'S NOT AMETRIC CINALIKE EPOCH UM WERE IT'S LIKE WE USED TO REALLY HARP ON IT AND NOW A SORTIWHOW MAY BE WE EXAGGERATED THAT LIKE ONESTLY JUST A BIT BUT TO ME DOESN'T CHANGE THE AQUATION MUCH BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MUSCLE IS A DESCRIBE THERE OTHER CONSEQUENCES THAT ARE GON TO MAKE FAT LOSS HART AND SO YOU NEED TO HAVE SUFFICIENT MUSCLE IF THE ADDITIONAL CLORIC EXPENDITURE IS THE CAROT GREAT IF IT'S SOMETHING ELSE I DON'T REALLY CARE I'M JUST AST ENOUGH EVIDENCE THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE IT OR I SHULD SAY THERE'S ENOUGH EVIDENCE THAT IT WILL REALLY HELP YOU IN YOUR PATH U MAYBE A FEU CALLORIES HERE THERE IS NOT REALLY THE THING ESPECIALLY IF YOU UNDERSTAND A NORMAL FOOD ITEM ANYTHING YOU PICK IS GOING TO BE PROBABLY A COUPLE OF HUNDRED CALLORIES ONE BAD FOOD CHOICE O DAY WELL OUT KICK ALMOST ANY AMOUNT OF COVERAGE YOU GOT ON A ADDING MUSCLE MAST TO YOU SO LIKE YOU YOU REALLY STEPPING OVER A DOLAR TO PICK UP A DIME IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT HOW MANY CALLORIES YOU'RE GETTING FROM MATDING MUSCLE U FATLOSSES CAN BE ABOUT REGULATING THAT CARBON AND TAKE ABOVE AND BEYOND ANYTHING ELSE I'D LIKE TO TAKE A BRIEF BREAK TO ACKNOWLEDGE OUR SPONSOR INSIDE TRACKER INSIDE TRACKERS A PERSONALIZED NUTRITION PLATFORM THAT ANALYZES DATA FROM YOUR BLOOD ENDIANEH TO HELP YOU BETTER UNDERSTAND YOUR BODY AND HELP YOU REACH YOUR HEALTH GOLLS I'VE LONG BEEN A BELIEVER IN GETTING REGULAR BLOOD WORK DONE FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT MANY OF THE FACTORS THAT IMPACT YOUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TURM HEALTH AND WELL BEING CAN ONLY BE ANALYZED FROM A QUALITY BLOOD TEST ONE ISSUE WITH A LOT OF BLOOD TASTINTY AND A US OUT THERE HOWEVER IS THAT YOU GET INFORMATION BACK ABOUT VERIOUS LEVELS OF LIPIDS AND HORMONES A METBOLIC FACTORS ET CETERA BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THAT INFORMATION INSIDE TRACKER MAKES KNOWING WHAT TO DO WITH ALL THAT INFORMATION EXCEEDINGLY EASY THEY HAVE A PERSONALIZED PLATFORM THAT LETS YOU SEE WHAT YOUR SIPPIS OIC NUMBERS ARE OF COURSE BUT THEN ALSO WHAT SORTS OF BEHAVIOUR OLD DEWS AND DONTS WHAT SORTS OF NUTRITIONAL CHANGES WHAT SORTS OF SUPPLEMENTATION WOULD ALLOW YOU TO BRING THOSE LEVELS INTO THE RANGES THAT ARE OPTIMOL FOR YOU IF YOU LIKE TO TRY INSIDE TRACKER YOU CAN VISIT INSIDE TRACKER DO CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET TWENTY PER CENT OFF ANY OF INSIDE TRACKERS PLANS AGAIN THAT INSIDE TRACKER DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET TWENTY PER CENT OFF S I'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS CONCEPT OF METABOLIC FLEXIBILITY MENTIONED A FEW TIMES FRANKLY YOU'RETHE FIRST PERSON WHOSE EVER EXPLAINED IT TO ME IN A CLEAR AND CONCISE WAY HOW DO I KNOW IF I AM METABOLICLY FLEXIBLE AND HOW DO I INCREASE MY METABOLIC FLEXIB ILITY SORE THERE'S NO SPECIFIC STANDARD WHICH IS ACTUALLYA GOOD THING AND SO IF YOU HAVE A LEVEL OF SPECIFICITY THAT YOU WANT OR NEED METABOLICALLY THEN YOU DON'T ACTUALLY WANT TO BE IN THIS MEALEGROUND AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE IF YOU ARE A PERFORMING IN A TYPE OF EXERCISE OR AN ATHOLETE WHO PERFORMS AN A SPORT THAT IS LIKELYLICALLY DOMINATED YOU DON'T WANT TO BE OPTIMALY MATAMOCLY FLEXIBLE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SUPERON'T CO FAT ADAPTED YOU WANT TO BE BYAS TOWARDS THE ENERGER GOING USE THE SAME COULD BE TRUE FOR THE OTHER AND THE SPECTRUM SO IN THOSE PARTICULAR CASES IT'S NOT OPTIMLE TO BE EQUALLY EFFECTIVE BECAUSE THERE ARE NO FREE PASSES IN PHYSIOLOGY IT A YOUR ENERGY PRODUCING SYSTEMS WE'LL OPREGULATOR DOWN REGULATE ACCORDINGLY SO YOU WILL ACTUALLY LIMIT YOUR ABILITY TO SAY MAXIMALLY UTILIZED CARBOHYDRAS A FUEL IF YOU'RE TRYING TO UPREGULATE YOUR ABILITY TO USE PHATAS A FIEL AND SO THIS IS LIKE THERE'S A SATURATION POINT OUTSIDE THAT SPECTOR MOST PEOPLE TO SAHAY LIKE I WANT A FEEL GREAT THROUGHOUT THE DAY TO WE'LL DO MUCH DIFFERENT THINGS HAW YOU KNOW COUPLE THINGS HERE'S A LOT OF BIOLOGICAL MARKERS YOU CAN TAKE I'M THERE'S ALSO TOT SOME SOME PRACTICAL TAKES NOW NONE OF THESE MARKERS BY THEMSELVES ARE ANY SIGN W YOU WANT TO DOS PROBABLY A COUPLE OF THEM AND THEN SAY L CATE THIS IS MAY BE A CLUE SO AGAIN IT'S REALY PORNT EMCIZE NOT A SINGLE ONE OF THESE TESTS THAT I'M ABOUT TO WALK YOU THROUGH AUTOMATICALLY MEANS YOU CAN'T YEARS THAT AS A FUEL OR THE OTHER CASE WHICH IS MAY BE YOUR POOR USING CARBOHYDRAT IS O FIELD SO THIS CLAIMERS ASIDE IM WELL ALL WILL GET INTO A COUPLE OF THEM SO SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT THESE AS INFORMATIVE AND USEFUL BUT NOT DIGNOSTIC EXACTLY A WE CALL THIS DATA INSPIRED OR DATA LED AND NOT DATA DRIVEN IR   SO NEMBER ONE YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT JUST OVER ALL FUNCTIONALITY DO YOU HAVE A REASONABLE REGULATION OF YOUR ENERGY THROUGHOUT THE DAY NOW MANY THINGS COULD BE GOING INDITHIS WHICH IS WHY THESE ARE NOT SPECIFIC DIGNOSTICS BUT IM AS A BASIC MEASURE WE TALKED ABOUT BLOOD LUCOS LEVELS I'M YOU DON'T A LOT PEOPLE SAY AAGAIN YOU WANT THAT TO BE SOMETHING LIKE BETWEEN EIGHTY AND NINETY A MILEGRAMS PRODESSOLATER IS THE BLOOD CLUCO S LEVEL AND AND IF YOUNGLE LOOK AT THE THE CUT OFF POINTS FOR WHAT DETERMINES TO BE PREDIABETIC AN TYPE TO DIABETIC ET CETERA I'M WHAT I CAN ACTUALLY RECOMMEND AND THIS IS THERE'S LO O A SIENCE YOURE ACTUALLY THAT I TOLALK EU THRU BUT LOT OF THIS IS MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE 'M I GENERALLY WANT PEOPLE TO BE AT EIGHTY FIVE OR LOWER AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF A COUPLE OF THINGS NUMBER ONE 'M THERE'S ACTUALLY SOME PAPERS THAT SHOWED ANY EVERY SINGLE POINT INCREASE ABOVE EIGHTY FIVE INCREASES YOUR LIKELIHOOD OF DEVELOPING TYPE YOU DIBEDIES BY ABOUT SIX PERCENT O GAT GREAT SO TECHNICALLY WHILE MAY BE NINETY OR NINETY FIVE REVEN UP TO HUNDRED OR YOU KNOW IN THE COTINCL NORMATO VALUES THAT'S ONE CLUE AGAINST NOT DEFINITIVE BY ITSELF DOES IT MEAN ANYTHING  YOU NEED TO REALLY PAY TTENTION O WHAT INCREASING BY SIX PERCENT ACTUALLY MEANS BUT IT'S A DATA POINT ERE I'M LOOKING AT IF I ACTUALLY THEN SEE SYMPTOMOLOGY AND WE RUN YOU THROUGH ME SOME QUESTION AIRS ASKED BA YOU'R FEELING THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND WE SEE UN CONTROLLED ENERGY BOUT SER LOT ENERGY THAN GET REALLY REALLY TIRED IN SWAINGS ANOTHER DATE A POINT AN WE MAY PASC A FEW THESE THINGS TOGETHER THAT MAY GIVE ME SOME CLUES  THAT BEING SAID AGAIN THIS A LOT OF THIS RHETORIC IS USED TO THEN SCARED PEOPLE OF OF CARBOHYDRATES AND THAT IS I WANT TO BE AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE THAT IS NOT NOT TRULY A THE ONLY THING PEOPLE SHOULD CARE ABOUTREADY CAN BE A THING I CAN ALSO BE UNRELATED THERE ARE REASONS YOU COULD HAVE BLOOD CLUCOS CONSCETRATIONS AT THIS LEVEL OR ENERY SWINGS THAT ARE UNRELATED TO CAR HYDRANGESTION AT ALL RIGHT SO ONE TEST YOU CAN A RUN IN ADDITION TO THAT IF YOU'REGIN TO GET BOODGLOCOS MEASURED YOU CAN LOOK AT SOME MARKERS WE TALKED OBUTTER RICHER A  T AN A L T WE TALKED ABOUT I YOU CAN KIND A LOOK AT THAT A A TDAL T RATIO BEFORE YOU CAN ACTUALLY O THE INVERSE WHICH IS LOOK AT AL T AN A S T   THE CAN ANORMA TOF VALUE THERE YOU CAN LOOK AT IS LIKE POINT EIGHT I ACTUALY LIKE TO SEE IT LOWER THAN THAT AND THAT ALONE IS AS BEEN ACTUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH BLOODLUCOS DIS REGULATION AND SO IF YOU SEE MULTIPOLY SCIENCE AGAIND WE'RE LOOKING FOR PATTERNS AND PATTERNS AND PATTERNS AN BOTH IN OUR CASE A BILE MARKERS SYMPTOMOLOGY AND PERFORMANCE AND NOW YOU IF IF ALL THREE O THOSE THINGS ARE LINING OUT YOU MAY HAVE AN ISSUE SO PERFORMANCE WISE A COUPLE OF LITTLE TEST YOU CAN RUN  I DEALLY YOU HAVE SOME SORT OF STANDARD WORK OUT YOU DO UN HOPEFULLY IT'S IT'S PRETTY OBJECTIVE SO AN OTHER WORDS LIKE A I RUN THE SAME FIFTEEN MINUTE LOOP EVERY MORNING FOR MY CARDIO O CAKGRAT HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE YOU TO RUN THAT LOUP YOU COULD PICK WHATEVER DISTANCE IT DOESN'T EALLY MATTER  WHAT'S YOUR HEART RAT DURING THAT THING AND THEN WHAT'S YOUR PERCEIVED EXERTION NOW YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT FASTED WITH VERY LITTLE DROP IN PERFORMANCE IF YOU CAN DO THAT AN THAT TELLS ME YOU'RE FAIRLY GOOD AT USING A FATUS FEELSOURCE IF HOWEVER THE ONE DAY YOU GO TO DO YOUR STANDARD WORK OUT AND YOU FEEL AWFUL FASTING THAT MAY BE ANOTHER CLUE THAT PERHAPS YOU'RE NOT VERY GOOD AT DILING IN  THAT SYSTEM IF YOU RECOVERY AFTERWARDS A TRIMS OF HARTREGT RECOVERY IS VERY LONG MAY BE ANOTHER CLUE THAT YOU HAVE A POOR UTILIZATION A FATUS OF FEELSOURCE THE INVERSE CAN ALSO BE TRUE SO IF I GIVE YOU SOMETHING IN THE NEIGHBOURHOD OF LIKE FIFTY OR SO GRAHAMS OF CARBOHYDRATE AND THIRTY MINUTES LATER YOUR FACE IS FALLING OFF THE TABLE THAT'S A GOOD SIGN THAT YOU'RE N THE OPSIT YOU'RE CTUALL VERY VERY VERY POOR UTILIZING CARBOHYDRATE AS AF FUEL AND THE REASON I BRING THAT UP IS  THAT IS EQUALLY A PROBLEM WE SEND WE WE HEAR PEOPLE A LOT MAY COMMONS M LIKE MAN II HAVE TO SAY AWAY FROM CARBS I C RASH REALLY HARD IF I DO THEM THAT AS WHAT THAT ACTUALLY MEANS IS YOU'RE VERY POOR AT UTILIZING CARBORHYDRATESIS FEEL YOU'RE GETTING A YOURE VERY  YOUR SENSITIVITY IS WAY OFF WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE CARBO HYDRATE AND A REASONABLE DOSAGE FIFTY GRAMS AND NOT FALL ASLEEP THIRTY MINUTS LATER OR AR HALVE TO RUNTO CAFINE SO 'M THAT IS A SIGN IN OUR OPINION THIS IS AGAIN NOW JUST MY PRACTICAL BRAIN TELLING YOU IS I'M THAT'S A SIGN OF OF DISFUNCTION I WE WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE PLENTY OF CARBORHDRATES FOR THE DAY IF WE SHOOSE TO IF WE WANT TO FOR ANY REASON I'M NOW OF COURSE IF YOU'RE TO THROW A HUNDRE AND FIFTY OR TWO HUNDRED GRAMS OF CARBOHYDRATE IN YOUR BELLY YOU'RE PROBALY UN TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF AN ENERGY HIT IV AFTER THAT BUT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE A REASONABLE DOSAGE AND NOT AU I'LL HAE TO FALL ASLEEP AFTERWARDS WHAT IS ONE WAY THAT PEOPLE CAN ENHANCE THEIR ULISATION OF CARBRHYDRATES I FOR EXERCISE AT THE REASASK AS I THINK I FALL INTO THAT CATEGORY YET I'M I DO CONSUME SOME COMPLEX CORRHYDRATES AND FRUIT POST RESISTANCE TRAINING AND THAT TENDS TO BE WHENT I'M HUNGRIEUS TWAR THEM BUT TYPICALLY UNLESS I'M I'VE JUST DONE SOME RESISTANCE TRAINING I KEEP MUST MY DAYTIME MEALS RELATIVELY LOW CARBOR HYDRATE AND THEN IN THE EVENING I PREFER SLIGHTLY LESS PROTINE AND MORE CARBOR HYDRATE BECAUSE IT HAS THIS EFFECT OF IMSEDATING ME A LITTLE BIT YET AND I SLEEP WELL AND I KNOW THIS RUNS AGAINST WHAT EVERYONE WAS TAUGHT A WHICH IS TO NOTY CARBORHYDERS LO E BUT I LIKE IT BECAUSE THEN IT TEND TO WAKE UP IN THE MORNING WITH AT LEAST AS FAR AS I CAN TELL MY GLIKAGE IN STORES NOT TE SILLY TOPPED OFF BUT BUT CERTAINLY FILLED YET IM AND I'M ABLE TO TRAIN FASTED IN THE MORNING AND MY FAVORITE PREWORK OUT IS I CONSIST OF WATER AND CAFFINE AN ELECTRO LIGHTS MAY BE  SOME SUPPLEMENTATION IS WELL BUT I I LOVE TRAINING FASTED SO THERE'S ACTUALLY A NUMBER OF THINGS IM ONE LITTLE STEAKY THING YOU THROUGHIN THERE AS ACTUALLY THE USE OF CAFINE SO THAT'S ANOTHER SIGN OF IF YOU HAVE TO HAVE KAFINE TO DO YOUR FASTER TRAINING THAT'S GENERALLY ANOTH OF SIGN YOU NOT VERY GET A USING FEEL SO I USE KAFFINE PRIOR TO RESISTANCE TRAINING WORK OUT IF GENERALLY I DON'T NEED IT FOR ANY KIND OF CARDYO ASKCLAREN YET I G IN LIST SAY THAT IT DOESN'T MEANS BAD IT IS JIS LIKE ANOTHER CLUE THIS LIKE O GA YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THIS WITHOUT HAVING O HALF CAFFINE TO EXECUTE IT NOW USING CAFFINE TO GET A BETTER RESULT IS IS SORT OF DIFFERENT AS AN URGAGETI ATE I'M WE YOU ACTUALLY USE A LOT OF HIGH CARBORHYDRATE MEALS OF THE OTHE DAY A LOT OF TIMES FOR OUR AT TIT TO AR CUTTING WIGHT OR TRYING TO REDUESWY SO IT IS A FANTASTIC WAY  TO HAND OF LOT OF THINGS AND THAT IDEA THAT IF YOU EAT CARBES LATE AT NIGHT  THAT I'LL INCREASE FAST SO LIKE THAT'S ALL IS SO OLD AND SO WELL DESTROYED SCIENTIFICALLY THAT THAT THAT'S NOT A CONCERN IM WE EITHERE'S THE SO MUCH DATA SHOWING IN FACT IT DOS SO MUCH DATA ON LIKE DEATING TIMING IS I IS A GENERALLY POORLY UNDERSTOOD ABOUT WHEN YOU CAN EAT IN WHAT YOU CAN E EATING IN THE MORNING AI PROSCEEDING AT NIGHT LIKE A LA LOT OF WLE YE HARD THERE IT IS NO IN MAYBE WE JUST SAVE THAT FOR SORT OF ANOTHER DACKE AS WORK TO GET REARLLY FAR DOWN THAT'S WHAT ARE WE CAN TA YET BUT YES I THINK OUR YOUG AN IS TO COVER THAT AN AN EPISODE ON NUTRITION IM UGEGRAT WHICH IS IN THIS SERIES THE A THE ONLY THING THAT ATITUDE IS YOU KNOW AT HERE ABOUT INJESTIN CARBORHYDRATE LATE AT NIGHT I SHOULD JUST SAY BAT A AT LEAST IN MY CASE I'M EATING MAJORITY OF MY CARBORHYDRATE UNLESS I TRAINE RESISTANCE TRAINED EARLY IN THE DAY IN WHICH GES SAID I POST RESISTANCE TRAINING IM IN THE LAST MEAL OF THE DAY BUT FOR ME THAT'S NOT REALLY LATE AT NIGHT THAT LAST MEAL I SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SIX THIRTY AND SEVEN THIRTY P M SUST THREE OR SO HOURS OR SOMETHING IKE HAVE A FOR TO SLEEP AROUND TAND TEN THIRTY OR SO YE SO IT'S NOT YOU KNOW MIDNIGHT A BOWLS OF POSTOR I'VE VE DONE THAT TOO BUT AM YET TII CAN IT'S NOT SO I THINK THAT UM PEOPLE WILL BE VERY INTERESTED I MYSELF CONCLUDED IN HOW MEAL TIME ING RELATES TALL OF THIS B IM E IT'S SO HAULARS PROVE FAT ITIS ATION HAD DIN YOU PROVE CARBIDISIONTES HAMMER BOTH THOUT REALLY QUICKLY IM AND A HANDSING FAT A UTILIZATION IS AS SIMPLE AS DOING A LITTLE BIT OF WORK IN A EITHER PRE FAT AND JESTED STATE SO ANY TIME YOU INJUST A NEW TRAANT PRIOR TO TRAINING YOU'RE GOING TO BUY US TOWARDS THAT NEWTRAN RIT WHICH IS ALMOST WHE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EITHER SO IF YOU WANT A GUARANTEE YOU BURN MORE FAT EAT MORE FAT PRIOR O WORK OUT NOW YOU' ARTE GOING TO LOSE FAT BUT WHAT YOUR WHAT YOUR FFACTALLY SIGNALING IS WE HAVE AN OVER ABUNDANCE OF THIS FUEL PREFERENTIALLY TARGET THIS FUEL NOW THE DOWNSIDE IS THAT MAY ACTUALLY HINDER YOUR PERFORMANCE I THAT'S TYPICALLY ONLY CONCERN FOR PEOPLE AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL A FAT IS A SLOWER FUEL SOURCE SO I YOU'RE RELYING U MORE UPON THAT YOUR TOP END IS GOING TO COME DOWN A LITTLE BET AND SO YOU WOULDN'T WANT A DUSE THAT STRATEGY PRIOR TO RACE IF IT IS A CARBOHYDRATE DEPENDENT RACE IT I'M THE FACT WE ACT YOU SEE LONG TRMADAPTATIONS I WOULD SUGGESTS AT SO THE ANSIMS RESPONSIBLE FOR CARBOHYDRATE MATABLISN WILL DOWN REGULATE AND SO YOU GET WORSE AT THAT I'SO NOT NOT A GRATE STRATEGY THER I'M CARBHYDRATE THE OBS IT RIGHT SO IF YU HAVE CARBOYDRATE PRIOR EXERCISE YOUIGIN A BUY AS MORE TOWARDS THAT SO A HANDFUL OF THINGS YOU CAN DO IF YOU'RE TOTAL COLORK CAN TAKE IS A SIMPLY MANAGED THAT'S GOING TO TAKE CARE OF LOT OF THESE PROBLEMS AN APPROPRIATE EATING STRTEGY SO THE TYPES OF FOOD THE COMBINATIONS OF FOOD IM ALL THOSE THINGS ARE GOING TO MAKE YOUR POST CARBOHYDRATE IN JESTIIN BUNK I LOTTTE THINGS CAN GO AWAY SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF PHYSIOLOGY THAT HAS TO BE IM CORRECT ED FOR SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT IN ONE HAND YOU CAN GO VERY DEEP YERE RIGHT SO THE REAL ANSWER OF HOW WE WOULD DO THIS IS IF WE SEE SANARY LIKE THAT WERE CAN I DO A WHOLE SET OF ANALYSIES WE'RE GT TO GOT FULL LABS RIGHT PROBABLY EXTENSIVE BLOOD PAN ALL YEARN SOLIVE A STOOL EVEN AND WE'RE GOING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE IS THAT LUCALS DISREGULATION COMING FROM SO LOT OF PEOPLE THINK LIKE ALL IT'S A MATABOLET MISSER IT MIGHT BE AND ALSO MIGHT JISBE IT FLAG THAT SOMETHING ELSE IS HAPPENING IN THE BODY SO WE NOVE ACTUALYT WORK BACKWARDS A LOT TO DRY TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHY THAT'S OCCURRING IT MAY BE SIMPLE AS OH YOURE EATING A LOT OF YOUR CAR BO HYDRATES WITHOUT ANY FIBR OR PROTY AND WE KNOW THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THOSE WILL ACTUALLY BLUNT THAT THE LYCEMIC ANDEXTS LIKE THE RISIN BLOOD TO SO IT COULD BE SIMPLE THING OF THISLIKE O YOU'R COMBINATION OF FOOD IS DOING IT'S NOT THE TOTAL AMOUNT IT MAY BE SOMETHING AGAIN MORE INDOGENOUS THE ACTUAL SYSTEM IT COULD BE IM A HORRAT IS SU IT COULD BE A BREATHING ISSUE THIT COULD BE A NUMBER OF THING SO THE WAY TO GET BETTER AT IT IS TO SIMPLY TRAIN IT AND SPECIFICITIES CANG HERE SO IF YOU WANT TO GET BETTER AT A MANAGING YOUR BLOOD GLUCOS THROUGHOUT THE DAY SO HOU NOT FEELING THOSE THINGS IT COULD BE A FUEL ISSUE BUT IT COULD BE A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS AND IT IS HARD TO GO INTO ALL OF THEM WITH WITHIN OUR TIME CONSTRAIN I'M SO THE PRACTICAL TOOL THAT I WOULD SAY HERE IS IF YOU WANT TO GET BETTER AT MANAGING ENERGY THROUGHOUT THE DAY MAKE SURE THAT NUMBER WAN YOUR PROTINA STABALIZE MAKES YIUNG SURE NUMBER TOO YOU'RE INGESTING YOUR FOOD IN THE RIGHT COMBINATIONS IDEALLY WITH SOME FIBER AND OR  SOME PROTINE OR BOTH THAT ALONE WILL HELP STABILIZE A LOW THE PROBLEMS  THEN YOU NEED TO TRAIN IT HIGH INTENSITY YOU WANT TO GET BETTER T USING CARBOHYDRATES OF FUEL TRAIN IT TO HIE INTENSITY AND HAVE CAR BOHYDRATES RIGHT BEFORE THE WORK OUT I WE'LL DO THAT A LOT IF A IIF AR IF IF WE SEE FOLKS WHO ARE II CANT O WALK YOU DO THE TEST OF IDENTIFYING IF YOU'RE NOT VERY GOOD USING FATES OF FUEL THE TASTPHER NOT BEING GOOD AT USING CAR BA HYDRATE IS TO FUEL IS BOTH THAT EATING THAT'S I TALKED ABOUT AS WELL AS PERFORMANCE IF YOU'RE A VERY VERY VERY SLOW STARDER IT'S JUST LIKE I REALLY HARD TO GET GOING THAT GENERALLY INDICATES YOU MINHT BEIN A SITUATION WHE YOU'RE NOT VERY GOOD USING CARBIDRS AS FUEL SO WE'RE GOING TO PRACTISE THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A PRE CAR BO HYDRATE PRE EXERCISE CAR BOHYDRA MEAL HEY WERE GOING TO HIGHER INTENSITY STOP NOT THE POINT OF MAKING YOU SICK AND DIGESTIVE ISSUEUS ALL THAT SUT BUT WE WANT TO GET BETTER AT USING CARBIDRTES AS A FUEL FASTER YOU WANT TO GET BETTER T DOING THE OPPOSITE THAN YOU DO THAT OPOSISTATTERY YOU EITHER AGAIN USING FAT PRIRE THE WORK OUT NOING YOUR PEIKE PERFORMANCE IS GONG TO GO DOWN A LITTLE BIT BUT YOUR GET YOUR INVESTING IN ADAPTATION RIGHTS I'S NOT ABOUT THAT WORK OUT I S ABOUT WHATS CAN HAPPEN SIX EIGHT TEN WEEKS OR NOUT IN VESTMN IS RAYONTOTHINK ABOUT T OR YOU COULD BRING IN SOME FASTED TRAINING AND SO WANT O REALLY MAKE SURE I CLARIFY WHEN WEARE TALKG ABOUT ANATHER I'M NOT AT ALL AGAINST FAST TO TRAINING IT'S NOT IT WORKS ITS THIS ISN'T REQUIRED FOR FAT LOSS IT ISN'T REQUIRED FOR FAT ADAPTATION IT IS A GREAT OPTION IF YOU WANT IM WHAT I WAS HOPING TO D IT THAT CONVERSATION AND MAYBEI DIDN'T ARTICULATE THAT WELL IS TO NOT RESTRICT PEOPLE BUT IT'S TO OPEN YOU UP AND AT LEASTA YOU HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS IF YOU LIKE TO DO FAST AT CARDIO AMAZING IT IS GREAT IF YOU HATE IT YOU DON'T HAVE TO YOU CAN REACH THE SAME PERFORM ANC SGOALS THE SAME PHYSICOALS WITHOUT EVER DOING IT IF YOU LOVE LONG DURATION STEADY STATE STUFF IT IS GREAT IF YOU HATE IT THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS HIER INTENSILY STUFF AGAIN FOR JUST TALKING ABOUT FATLOSS SO I I HOPE NOW THAT THAT'S A LITTLE CLEARER IN TERMS OF THE SAMELING NUTRICION IF YOU LIKE HIER CARB GREAT  YOU LIKE LOR THAT THESE AREALL GREAT YOU HAVE OPTIONS AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO FRET SO MUCH OVER OH MY GASH I HAVE TO DO THIS THING IN CERTAIN WAY AND I ABSELY HATE IT YOU DOL HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT HIT THOSE CONCEPTS AND YOU'LL BE FINE A FEW MINUTES TO GO YOU MENTION THAT IF WE INGEST TO GIVIN MAKERONUTREEN THAT THEN THE BODY WILL PREFERENCILLY USE THAT FEEL SOURCE YOU JUST CARHYDRED WILL USE THAT FEEL SOURCE IS IT ALWAYS THE CASE THAT THE BODY USES THE INJESTED MACKRANUTREANT PRIOR TO USING LICAGEN IF TO IMAGINE INS USING BOTH IMING IF I WERE TO HAVE SOME CARBOHYDRATE BEFORE AN DOING ANY KIND OF TRAINING THE MUSCLE STILL BURN LICAGEN RIGHT OR DO THEY HAVE SOME WAY TO REGISTER THE AMOUNT OF CIRCULATING CARBOHYDRATE THT WOULD ALLOW OR AVAILABLE CARBOHYDRATE IN THE FORM OF FOOD STUFFS A THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO NOT TAPPEN TO THEIR OWN MUSCLE FIBR STORES OF LICAGEN RIGHT SO THE WAY WE DERIVE ENERGY FOR EXERCISE OR BASICMANENTS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT CYLER PHYSIOLOGY SO YOU'VE GOT A COUPLE OF ORGANEL INSTRUCTURES O IOU TO PAYTENTION IF THE FIRST ONE IS THE NEWCLIS THAT'S HOLD YOUR DEINA THE SECOND ONE IS A MITAL CONDRE AND THE EVERYTHING OUTSIDE THAT YOUVE GOT ALL THSE OTHER ORGANL THAT DO ABUNCH OF THINGS LIKE RABAZONS FOR PROACHING SYNTHESIS ET CETERA CETERA  IHT NO WHEN YOU WANT TO PRODUCE ENERGY FOR EXERCISE ANY TIME YOU HEAR THE WORD ANOROBIC YOU AUTOMATICALLY UNDERSTAND WE ARE MEANING WITHOUT OXYGEN ARE IT GREAT THAT ALL HAPPENS IN THE CIDA PLASSM THE CIDAL PLASM IS THAT SPACE THAT IS NOT THE MOTO CONDRIA NOT THE NEWCLIS SO IT'S THE SPACE IN BETWEEN EVERYTHING ELSE IS IS LIKE JELLY LIKE SUBSTANCE OF SANDS THERE SO ANEROBC WITHABOLISM HAPPENS THERE EVERY SINGLE A ROBIC METABOLIC PROCESS HAPPENS IN THE MITO CONDRI AREIT WHY IS THAT BORN IF I GO TO CREATE CELLULAR ENERGY AND I NEED IT THE FASTEST POSSIBLE I'M GOING TO GO FOR POSPHEL CREATING BECAUSE IT IS STORED DIRECTLY IN THE CIDAL PLASSUM THE STOECIOMTREES ONE TO ONE THERE WHICH MEANS FOR EVERY MOLE OF POSPHO CREATION I BURN I CAN CRATE ONE EIH T P IT'S ONE TO ONE IT IS INCREDIBLY FAST BUT IT IS VERY LIMITED BECAUSE THINK ABOUT IT HOW MUCH OF THAT COULD I POSSIBLY STORE IN THE SMALL SIZE OF THE CELL THAT'S IT IF I NEED ENERGY PAST THAT POINT NOW ALL START USING MUSCLE LIAGEN BECAUSE THAT IS ALL SO STORED IN THE CIDAL PLASM SO IT IS RIGHT THERE THE STOI CIOMETRYES NOT ONE TO ONE AT THE LO BUT HIGHER PROBABLY LIKE FOUR TO ONE SO FOR EVERY MOLECULE OF LIKE AN DINIOUR BURN YOUR GOING TO GET SOMETHING LIKE FOUR YES SOME SMALL NUMBER OF EIGH T PADA THAT WHICH IS GREAT BUT AGAIN YOU'RE RUNNING INTO A STORAGE PROBLEM HOW MUCH CAN I POSSIBLY STORE INSIDE A MUSCLE SO IT IS VERY VERY FAST MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE THAN FOSTERCRETIN BUT SO THERE IF I THEN WANT TWO METABOLIES ANY FORM OF FAT OR IF I WANT TO COMPLETE THE METABOLIZATION OF CARBA HYDRATES I HAVE TO START TRANSFERRING INTO THE MITA CONDRE NOW I START GETTING WHOLE HOSTS OF EIGH T P A IF YOU ERE TO FULLY RUN THROUGH THIS THING WHICH I'LL TALK ABOUT A SECOND I'M CALLD THE T C A CYCL A CREPCYCLED YOU'LL GET NOW SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY EIGHT OR THIRTY OR THIRTY FIVE ATAN A DOPENNING EIGHTY PEOPER I SO THE ENERGETIC OUTPUT IS MUCH HIGHER GESS HERE'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS HAN I'MEN' WALKYOU THROUGH THIS IN THE FORM OF CARBO HYDRATE THAT I'LL COME BACKWARDS AND GO THROUGH IM FAT SO REMEMBER CARBO HYDRATE IT IS ONE CARBON MOLECULE THAT HAS BEEN HYDRATED SO IT IS ONE TO ONE SO THE ACTUAL I CHEMISTRY HERE IT IS SEE EIGH TWO O ONE CARBON TWO EIGHT ONE UP GLUECOST IS A SIX CARBON CHAIN SO THE CHEMISTRY HERES SEE SIX EIGH TWELVE O SIX SIX CARBONS SIX WATERS VERY SIMPAT'S CARBAHYDRE I SO YOU CAN IMAGINE IF YOU'RE WATCHING ON THE VIDYO HEROR YOU'LL YOU'LL SEE MY FINGERS GOING NOT TI'LL TRY TO MAKE SURE I EXPLAIN ITOYOU ALL JUST LA SAYING IN EASY FASHION SO YOU'VE GOT THIS CHAIN OF SIX CARBONS AS IN FRONTO YOU AND THE VERY FIRST SEPTIMATABOLISS YOU SNAP THAT THING AND A HALF RIHTS YOU BREAK INTO TWO SEPARATE THREE CARBON CHAINS RIHT NOW IN DOING THAT YOU GOT A LITTLE BIT OF ENERGY COULD YOU BROK THAT ONE BOND BUT NOT A TREMEDICS AMOUNT THIS IS CALLED BLY CALLVISES SO LICIS BEING THE SPLIT LIKE BENG LIKE YOU SPLIT LIKE AGEN UP GOT A LITTLE BIT ENERGY OF THAT RI YOU FORMED THIS THREE CARED CARBON CHAIN CALLED PYRUVATOR PIRUVICACID THERE'S DIFFERENCES THERE BUT DON'T DONT COMMEDS GENERAL AUDIENCE FRIENDS I I GOT A OT I GIVE THIS COMMUNICATE THIS TO EVERYBODY DO YOU GOT ALITTLE TO THAT NOW YOU CAN'T DO MUCH PAST THAT BESIDES RIP ONE MORE CARBON OFF OF EACH OF THOSE THREE CARBON CHAINS SO I'VE GOT TWO THREE CARBON CHAINS I  BE CAREFUL HOW I DO THIS WITH MY FINGER SO I DON'T FLIP YOU OFF HEREAND A SECOND BUT I BURN ONE MORE OFF OF EACH I GET A LITTLE BIT O ENERGY AND NOW THAT LITTLE TWO CARBON CHAIN I HAVE TWO TWO CARGRM CHAINS THOS ARE CALLED AST ITILL COWAY ARE T AMAZING I HAVE NOW COMPLETED ANTAROBIC MY CALISIS I'VE GOT REALLY NOTHING LEFT I CAN DO HERE A MADE A LITTLE BUT EIGH T P OU WAIT A MINUTE I HAVE NOW TREED TWO CARBONS BECAUSE AN MI START WITH SIX I SPIT OF THE APARBOT I DIDN'T AT TWO THREE CARBON CHAINS I BURNED ONE EACH I'VE GOT TWO FHREE FROTON CARBONS I HALF TO NOW DO SOMETHING WITH THEM MY BODY WILL NOT LET ME GO THROUGH THAT PAT THAT LAST PROCESS UNLESS I'VE GOT A PLAN FOR THAT FREE CARBONC AS I CAN'T BREAK IT AN HALF AMAZING HERE'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IF I HAVE THOSE THREE CARBON MOLECULES AND I DON'T HAVE ANYWHERE I CAN PUT THAT CARBON YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GO TOGH THAT PROCESS IT'S GOING TO STOP IT YOU'RE GEST AUR BUILDING UT PYRUVATE NOW AT THE SAME TIME YOU'RE BREAKING A T P FOR FUEL THAT'S CALLED EI T P HYDROLUSES AND YOU HAVE WATER THAT COMES IN YOU HAVE AN ENDENCINE AND THREE PHOSPHACE AS SWITES CALLED EH T P DENISON TRY PHOSPHATE ONE TO THREE YOU BREAK ONE OF THOSE PHOSPHATES OFF THERE YOU GO THERE YOUR ENERGY SAND I HAVE A FREE FOR FLOATING IN ORGANTIC PHOSPHATE AND A DENIZING DIE PHOSPHATE SO TOO OVER THERE AMAZING THAT ACTUALLY RESULTS BECAUSE YOU USE WATER FOR IT RESULTS ANY FREE FLOATING HYDROGEN ION A JUST HAVE TO TRUST ME HYDROGEN EA T WELL ANY IDEA WHAT A FREE FLOATING HYDROGEN IS IM IT'S GOIE THE ASIT TETS IS I WAS GANSTASCAN INCREASE ASTIDITY THAT'S WHAT TO SIE ANY ONE HAS EVER MEASURED P H WHAT YOU REALLY MEASURING IS THE THE THE AMOUNT OF HYDROGEN POTENTIAL HYDROGEN THAT'S A P  IS RIGHT HONER PRESENTER THERE'S TOO DEFINITIONS OF P H BUT YOU GET US ONE OF THE TWO SO IS THIS ARE YOU NO TELL ME THIS IS RELATED TO THE THE THE BURN WE'RE GOIN TO GET CLOSE RIGHT SO I'VE GOT A BUNCH OF FREE FLOAING YOU GOT THE PHOSPHATES WHICH ARE ACTUALLY PROBLEM TO A'M PROBABLY MOREER PROBLEM IN PEOPLE REALIZE AND THAT HYDROGEN WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THAT HYDROGEN BUT ONE THING YOU CAN DO AS ACTUALY SHIP BUT OVER TO PYRUVATE AND BOND IT THERE WE HAVE A SPECIAL NAME FOR THAT LITTLE MOLECULE WHEN YOU HVE PYRUVATE NU HAVE HYDROGEN ATTACHED TO IT DOUN N IT'S CALLED AH HYDROGEN PROXIDE LACTATE LACTITE LACK TO GACID THIS IS THAT WHLE SYSTEM RIGHT GAN I'M SKIPPING SOME SCA STEPS MAKING A LITTLE BIT OF MISTAKES ERE UNTENTIOALLY FOLKS DUSMAKE THIS SISTEM SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU START RUNNING A BUNCH OF VANEROBIC LIKE CHALSIS YOU START SEEING MASS OF RISES IN LACTATE COOL NOT LACK AGANS IT RIGHT RIGHT THAT'S WHY WE SEE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN A LOT OF LACTATE AND A LOT OF FATIGUE BUT THE LACKTATES ACTUALY NOT CAUSING THE FATIGUE THE LACKTATE IS ACTUALLY SPARING YOU FROM HAVING IT MUCH A FREE FLOATING ASKIT IT'S ALSO CAN BE THEN USED DIRECTLY BACK IN THE MUSCLE BECAUSE AS SOON AS YOU BRING IN ENOUGH OXYGEN AND YOU CAN TAKE THAT HYDROGEN BACK OFF OF IT YOU'VE NOW TURN O RIGHT BACK INTO PYRUVANTE YOU CAN RUN IT THOUGH THIS WHOLE CYCLE AS FUEL THAT I'M ABOUT TO DO YOU CAN OCTUALY ACTUAL SHIP AT OUT OF THE EXERCISING MUSCLE AND SHIPP IT INTO A NON EXERCISING MUSCLE AND THEN GO BACKWARDS AND MAKE GLUCOS WHAT ACTUALLY LIBERATES HYDROGEN FROM FROM LACTATE WYOU LIKE CHEMICALLY YES OR WHAT WHAT LIBERATES AWHAT WEL WHAT ARE THE STIMULE THET CAN TAK HYDROGEN OFF THE PYROVATE AO AND AND THEN IN OTHER WORDS TO REDUCE LACTATE AND FREE UP THAT HYDROOXYEN AVILABILITY SO IN FACT ONE OF THE MAJOR PLACES THAT YOU SHIP HYDROGEN TO AR ONE OF AJOR PLACES THA YOU SHIP LACK TEY TOS YOUR HEART BECAUSE ITS IS WELL WE COLLECT THE ULTIMATE SOLTRA FIBER AND IT IS HAS A TON OF FREELY AVAILABLE MATOCONDRIA WECH HAVE A TON OF ACCESS TO OXYGEN SO ICAN ACTUALLY THEN GO TO IT FORM WATER THEY S YOU WL CAN BE USED TO FORM WATER AND NOW WE HAVE A PLACE THI SORT THEHYDROGEN ON IT RIGHT GO SO AS A RESULT OF ANEROBIC LIKE COLISES WE HAVE MADE A LITTLE BIT OF E T P WE'VE CREATED A LOT O WASTE AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY WORD TO GO ITH THESE EN PRODUCTS SO WHEN YOU DO ANYTHING OF A HIGHER INTENSITY AND IT SAYS I NEED ENERGY FAST YOU'RE GONG TO GO TO THIS SYSTEM FIRST RIGHT RIGHT PAST EIG T P BECAUSE IT IS THE FASTIS PLACE TOGANNITY BUT YOU'RE NOT GIN TO GET MUCH OF IT AND YOU GOT A DEAL WITH THE WASTE PRODUCTS BO RIGHT BACK TO THE GUINEA OF OUR CONVERSATION AND DURANCE IS ABOUT TWO THINGS ENERGY PRODUCTION AND WASTE MANAGEMENT AND WRIGHT ERE FATIGUE BUFFERING THIS IS IT RIGHT HOW WELL CAN YOU HANDLE THE ELEVATIONS IN HYDROGEN RIGHT DROP IN P H AND HOW ON WHAT YOUN A DO THESE PRODUTS IF YOU WANT TO FULLY METABOLIZE A CARBOHYDRATE YOU THEN HALF TO TAKE SOME TO SOMETHING WITH THOSE PYROVATES OR THOSE ASATO COES WHICH ARE GOING TO DO IF OXYGEN IS AVAILABLE YOU WILL TAKE THOSE THINGS AND SHIP THEM INTO THE MITO CONDREA THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH SOME SO WALLS AND SOME OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT BUT THEY'RE GOING TO GET INSIDE THERE ONCE THERE IN THERE THAT TWO CARBON AS TICOE RUNS TO THIS ENTIRE CYCLE THAT WE CALL THE CREBCYCLE THAT'S THIS REALLY INTERESTING PLACE THAT'S WHERE O B SIX AND ANAMAN PEOPLE ARE THAT'S WHERE THAT WHOLE STUFF SARS TO KICK AND ALL YOUR BEVITEM INS BASE WE RUN THAT ENTIRE CIRCLE IM AND YOU G TO START OFF THE TOP YOU HAVE A MUCH OF FUNSTUFF GOING ON BUT AS THE PART OF THAT CIRCLE YOU CAN O PULL OFF SOME SOME O HYDROGEN IONS YOUGAN SEND THEYS TO ITS CALE THE ELECTOR ON TRANSPORT CHAIN THAFTER YOU CAN TO GET TON OF E T P ATO AND AS A RESULT ABOUT HALF WAY THROUGH THE TURN YOU CAN TO PULL OFF ONE CARBON AND ABOUT HALF WAY THROUGHTH OTHER BUT ALMOST THEITHER WY T FINISHRING TO ULL OFF THE SECOND CARBON SO YOU E TO TAKE THE SECOND AST UTILCOA RUN THAT ENTYRE THING SAME THROUGH AS WELL AND SO WHAT WE DID IS WE STARTED OFF WITH A SIX CARBON GLOCOSE CHAIN WE SPLIT AN HALF WE CALL THOSE PYRUVATE MADE LITTLE BIT ENERGY CAUSE WE BROKE THAT ONE BOND OF THOSE TWO CARBONS THAT ARE IN THE MIDDLE GO THOSE TWO THREE CARBON MOLECULES WE PULLED ONE CARBON OFF OF EACH WEE BROUGHT IN WE SARE WE MOVE THOSE IN THE MITOCONDRIA WEE BROUGHT ONE OFF WE TOOK A BREATH BROUGHT IN SOME OXYGEN BON O THAT BREAT TOOK OUT TWO SEAL TO EXALS WE RAN THE ASK TOTILL COA THROUGH THE CREP CYCLE ONE TWO CARBONS PER TURN COMING OUT A SEAL TWO SO WE HAD SIX CARBONS TOTAL EN WE STARTED AND WE EXITED WITH ZERO CARBONS NOW WE HAVE FULLY METABOLIZED A MOLECULE OF CARBO HYDRA THAT REQUIRED AN ANEROBIC START AND A ROBIC FINISH IF YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF MITO CHONDRIA LARGE MARI CNDREA HIGH FUNCTIONING MOTO CONDRIA YOU'RE GOING TO LIMIT YOUR ANROL PER FORMANCE BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO GET THET GON TO RUN THAT DOOR FULL VERY VERY QUICKLY YOU CAN'T GO PASS IT BECAUSE HYDROGEN WOULD BUILD UP WAY TOO FAST AND ONE OF THINGS THAT WE KNOW IS BOTH TEMPERATURE AND P H SRUN ENDS I'M FUNCTION SO THEY'RE GONG TO STOP YOU ONLY BE RALL THE RUN THROUGH IN FACT THAT EIH T P HYDROLISIS FACE EVEN IF I GAVE YOU A WHOLE INFINITE SUPPLY OF E T P IF I PUT ENOUGH ASCIT IN TEREY WOULD STOP WORKING BECAUSE THE H T P H ENDS IM NEEDED TO SPLIT  WON'T BE ABLE TO RUN IN HIGHLY SAID A ENVIRONMENT OR AT A HOT ENVIRONMENT AT SOME POINT PERHAPS TO DAY PERHAPS IN A FUTURE DISCUSSION BUT STILL NOT TOO FAR FROM NOW WE COULD TALK ABOUT THE RAL OF TEMPERATURE A IN THE I IMPIRUVATED FROM IN TERMS OF ITS REGULATION MUSCLE CONTRACTION BUT I WONT TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTOOD SOMETHING CORRECTLY YOU MENTION THESE ATLEAST A TOO PARALLEL FEEL SYSTEMS RI ONE IS ESENTILLY ANEROBIC RIGHT AND THE OTHER IS EROBIC YOU SAID TH AT IF WE CAN'T PULL ENOUGH UM IFWE CAN'T BREAK ENOUGH BONDS THAN WE LIMIT OUR ANEROBIC CAPACITY CORRECT I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT GIVEN THAT A THE MIGHT A CONDREAR THE SIGHT FOR ESSENTIALLY FOR AROBIC MATAVOLISM YET THAT WE WOULD BE LIMITING OUR EROBIC CAPACITY AS WELL UM PERHAPS YOU COULD JUSTCLARIFY FOR ME HOW THESE TWO THINGS ARE DIVIDE IT WERE IS THEYRE NOT A CLEAN DIVISION ISN'T NOT IN EITHER NO EFFACT I GET I THINK IT'S BETTER TO THINK OF THESE THINGS RATHER AS TO SEPARATE PAIRIL OF THINGS AS ONE BIG CYCLE THEY'RE ONE GEAR TURNING THE NEXT BEING COMPROMISED IN ONE WILL COMPROMISE THE OTHER THAT I SHOULD SAY REMINDS ME OF WHAT YOU SAID EARLY WHICH IS THI THE BISCAL GEAR ANS ANALOGY THAT WORKS A GRIGHT SO IF YOU IF YOU SHORT CIRCUAT ONE BASLY THAT THE CHAIN CAN'T MOVE THAT'S THET FANTASTIC OCASE SO AM SO INDEED THEY THEY ARE RUNNING IN PARALLEL BUT THEY ARE UM INTERE DEPENDENT YET WELL THERE ACTUALLY NOT EVEN RUNNING IN PARALLEL BECAUSE THE'RE ACTUALLY FUMMLING TO THE SAME INPOINT RIGHT WHICH IS LIKE IF IF YOU'RE GOING TO COME FROM THE ANEROBIC LIKE HOLLISIS ROUT OR EVEN A COME FROM THE FAT ROTE WHICH ALL TALK ABOUT A SECOND THEY'RE BOTH GOING TO BE LIMITED IN THE MITO CONDRA SO HEN THAT THINGS FULL IT DOESN'T MATTER YOU CAN'T RUN EITHER SYSTEM RGHT SO IT IS MORE OF LIKE A AGAIN IF YOU'RE RUNNING THE BITE GEARS IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER IF THE BACK ONES LARGER OR SMALLER BECAUSE IF EITHER ONE IS LIMITED YOUR TOSTS CAUSE THERE RUNNING ON THE SAME SYSTEM YOU CAN YOU CAN DEN SNEAK A LITTLE BIT HERE AND THERE BUT BUT NOT MUCH YOU ALSO REALLY NICELY HIGHLIGHTED HOW LACK  THIS THING THAT WE THINK OF AS HA THE A LIMITING FACTOR THE BURN IT GETS IN THE WAY AND  THE THING WE NEED TO STOP AND BUFFER IN ALL ALL SORTS OF THINGS OR IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY A FUEL IT'S I ITS  TREMENDOUSLY EFFECT OF FUEL ES IT IS A STRONGLY PREFERRED YUELL ACTUALLY THE IS IS INTRE IS ICHE VERY CLASSIC CASE OF ASSOCIATION  CORRELATION FOR SUS CAUSA T SO THEY THE ORIGINAL ACTICT THAT THIS RITECAL HISTORY ON LACTA BUT IT WAS ORIGINALLY FOUND I THINK IN GERMANY PARDON MY HISTORY THERE SOME SOMEWHERE IN EUROPE AND HUNTED STAGS SO ON THE THNGS IS A SORT OF REALISES LIKE IF WE IF WE WE HARVEST AT A STAG IN A RECISTATE WHEN IT DIDN'T NH WE WERE THERE VERSES IF WE CHASTE IT AND IT WAS RAN DOWN THAT THESE LACK TAY CONCENTRATIONS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AND IN THE LATTER SITUATION THEREFORE LACK TATE STARTED IMMEDIATELY GETTING THIS ASSOCIATION BETWEEN HIGH FATIGUE POINTS AND IT IS EASY TO MEASURE IF YOURE TO DO ANY SORT OF LACK A TEST ANY SORT OF METABOLIC TEST YOU WILL SEE AS FATIGUE INCREASES LACK EY WILL ALSO INCREASE THE ASSOMPTION THERE WAS THEN ALL MY GOSH IT'S THE CAUSE NOW WE KNOW LIKE AGAIN IT'S NOT THE THING AT ITTS IN LARGE PART TRYING TO BUFFER THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF A TPHYDRALYSIS AND AND SOME OTHER THING SO IT IS CERTAINLY PLAYING A PART IN THAT ROLL BUT IT IS NOT THE COR DRIVER IT'S ALSO WHY YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT DOING THINGS TO QUOT ON QUOTE AREDUCE LACKTATE THE MUSCLE AFTER EXERCISE OR TO CLEAR LACTATE OR ANY THOSE THINGS YOU MAY STILL WANT TO DO THOSE ACTIVITIES BUT NOT FOR THAT REASON LACKTATES FINE YOUR ACTION ON USE IT AND AGAIN THE NEIGHBORING EXERCISE  MUSCLE FIBERS IN THE SAME MUSCLE ANOTHER MUSCLE YOU CAN SEND IT ACTUALLY TO THE ATO THE LIVER AND I CAN ACTUAL GO THROGH LUCONIA GENESIS AND I CAN ACTUALLY REPLENISH LIVERIC LIKE AGON JUST  AS IT FEEL SORCE OR YOU SEND HARDER ANY NUMBER OF SOURCES YOU CAN ALSO TIS CORT OF PUT INT CIRCULATION PUT A BACK IN THE MUSCLE AND ONCE ENOUGH ACTION IS THERE YOU CAN DISKICKE A RIGHT BACK INTO EITHER GLUCCOS OR K LIKE AGEN IT  IS TOTALLY FINE SO IT IS OBVIOUSLY CLEAR THOUGH ONCE THAT NUMBER GETS VERY VERY HIGH OTHER THINGS ARE GOING TO BE HAPPENING THAT I BECOUSING A LOT OF HURT AND THIS IS YOUR MANAGING WASTE RIGHT IS REALLY AN ISSUE OF MANAGING WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITH ALL THIS EXRA CARBON WHAT AM I GOIG TO DO WITH ALL THIS SECTURE IN ERGAETIC PHOSPHATE AND AND SOME OTHER NASTY BY PRODUCTS BUT THAT'S THE THING YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH I LEV OR YOU TO TEACH ME HOW DIFFERENT RATIOS OF FUEL SOURCES ARE USED DEPENDING ON HOW LONG I HAPPEN TO BE EXERCISEING FOR EXAMPLE IF I DO A VERY SHORT BOUD OF EXERCISE YET TYPICALLY THAT'S QUORRELATED WITH A HIGHER INTENSITY OUTPUT M I SUPPOSE I COULD JOG FOR ONE MINUTE BUT HERE I'M THINKING ABOUT SPRINTING FOR ONE MINUTE OR LESS WHICH FUELS ARE USED IS THAT MAINLY DRIVEN BY FAT STORES BY CARBORHYDRATE STORES IS IT DRIVEN BY DIETARY FAT PREFERENTIALLY OR CARBIDRY THAT I'VE INGESTED IF INDEED I'VE INGESTED THOS OREPROACHING FOR THAT MATTER AND THEN IS WE TRANSITION TO EXERCISE TIT GOES A A BIT LONGER ANYWHERE FROM YOU KNOW THREE TO F IVE MINUTES HOW DO THOSE RATIOS CHAINGE AND AS WE TRANSITION TO LONGER DURATION WHAT MOST PEOPLE THINK OF IS ENDURANCE EXERCISE BUT LONG DURATION OUTPUT OF YOU KNOW TWENTY MINUTES OR MORE LEADING ALLTHE WAY UP TO FULL MARITHON HOW DOES THAT CHANGE THE RATIO OF FUEL SOURCES THAT ARE USED AND I BE PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN CARBOHYDRATE FAT AND PROACHING THAT'S INJESTED SO COMING FROM FOOD SORT SIS OR CARBOHYDRATE FAT AND PROACING THAT ARE COMING FROM STORGE SITES WITHIN THE BODY OOK A GREAT LET'S START AT ZERO SECONDS AND RUN ALL THE WAY THROUGH MARITHON AND WELL WOL FLAG THE DISTINCTIONS WHERE THEY START CHANGING AS SOON AS YOU WAN US CREATE MUSCLE CONTRACTION OF POWER THE VERY FIRST SOURCE OF ENERGY IS FOSSIL CREATING THAT'S GON O POWER YOU FOR ZERO TO MAYBE SAY EIGH TO FIFTEEN TWENTY SECONDS OF MAXIMAL EXERTION AND THAT'S IN COMING FROM THE MUSCLE FIBRS HIMSELF YET THAT IS ACTUALLY STORED IN THE WAS CALL THE SIDAL PLASUM SO THIS IS THE LITTLE AREAR SPACE IN THE MUSCELE FIBR IM THAT'S SOT LIKELIN THIS JELLY LIKE SUBSTANCE AND IT'S NICE BECAUSE ONE MOLECULE OF PHOSPHE CREETING GIVES YOU ONE MOLECULE OF A T P SO IT'S NOT A BIG ENERGY OUTPUT BUT IT'S VERY FAST BECAUSE IT IS STORED RIGHT THERE IN THE LOCAL EXERCISING MUSCLE RIGHT NOW IF YOU NEED ENERGY PASS THAT POINT SAY YOU KNOW TEN OR FIFTEEN SECONDS UP TO MAYBE A COUPLE OF MINUTES THIS IS NOW YOU CANT HAVE TO TRANSITION BECAUSE YOU AN BURN THROUGH THAT PHOSPHE CREATING THSS CAN BE OUT YOURN A HAVE TO MOVE TO NOW CARBOHYDRATE METALBALLISM THIS IS WHAT WE CALL ANEROBIC BLI COLLUSIS SO THERE'S TWO PHASES OF LI CALLSUS NOW GLYCOLLUSUS ITSELF MEANS GLUCOS BURNING I SO JUST MEANS WHERE USING CARBOHYDRATE AS A FUEL SOURCE SO INITIALLY WHEN WE START OFF THIS CASCADE IM WHICH IS GOING TO TAKE US AGAIN FOR A A COUPLE OF MINUTES IM CARBOHYDRATE UTILIZATION COMES FIRST FROM THE EXERCISING MOSCLES WHITS VERY SIMILAR TO FOSIL CREATING THAT WAY IF YOU START RUNNING LOW ON IT YOU CAN ACTUALLY TART PULLING BLOOD GLUCOS AND IF BLOOD GLUCOS GETS SLOW YOU'LL OF TUS AUR GETTING LICIGEN FROM THE LIVER TO KEEP THAT UP AND WE'VE SORT OF CARVER THAT CONVERSATION I SO LITTLE BIT CHAMISTRY HERE JUST GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT OF  ROOM HERESO NOW REMEMBER A CARBOHYDRATE IS A CARBON MOLECULE THAT HAS BEEN HYDRATED SO ONE CARBON ATTACHE TO ONE WATER AND RUMMER WATERIS H TO  MOST OF THE TIME RE TALKING ABOUT GLUCOS IT IS IN THE SIX CARBON CHAIN SO SIX CARBONS ATTACHED TO SIX WATER MOLECULES RIGHT GREAT WHEN I GO TO SPLIT THIS UP THROUGH ANEROBIC LIK CALSUS IT WORKS A LITTLE BIT LIKE THIS SO YOU GOT THIS SIX CARBON CHAIN THE FIRST STEP IS TO SNAP THAT THING AND HALF YOURE GN TO MAKE TWO THREE CARBON CHAINS NOW WE BROKE ONE BONDRIGHT THERE SO WE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF ENERGY BUT NOT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT I'M AT THE END OF ANEROBIC LIKE OLISIS YOU'REGIN A NET SOMETHING LIKE THREE OR FOUR EH T P SO MORE THAN YOU GET FROM THE PHOSER DRIPLE IS QUADRUPLE BUT STILL NOT VERY MUCH THERE'S ANOTHER MAJOR DOWNSIDE THAT'S COMING IN A SECOND TO THE SYSTEM THE UPSIDE IS ITS FAST NOW WHY DON'T ACTUALLY ONE ADAPTATION WE GET TO TRAINING IN THIS STYLE IS YOU'LL INCREASE YOUR BUILTYTO STORE PLICAGEN IN YOUR MUSCLE WHICH IS GREAT RIGHT WE CAN ACTUALLY BY UP SEE YOU CANDMEASURE THE AMOUNT THE EUSTORE AND A TRAINING ADAPTATION IS OSSOME SO YOU'R ABLE TO SUSTAIN THIS SYSTEM LONG OR SO PERHAPS NINETY SECONDS INTO YOUR INTERVAL TRAINING YOU GET A FATIGUE POINT AND NOW YOU MAYBE CAN A SEND THAT TO A HUNDRED A HUDRED FIFTEEN SECONDS SIMPLY BECAUSE YOUR STORING WORK LIKE A GEN IN THE MUSCLE BEFORE WE HAVE TO EN THEN GO INTO THE BLOOD AND GET A N FORMILICOS SO THAT'S GREAT SO WE'VE GOT THI SIX CARBON MOLECULE AND WE SPLIT THIS AND HALF WE GOT THAT LITTLE BUT AT EIH T P AND NOW WE'RE IN THIS LITTLE TRICKY POSITION BECAUSE THIS THREE CARBON MOLECULE AS WHA WE CALL PIRUVE PIRUVICACIT AND AGAIN CHEMISTREE FOLKS I'M SKIPPING SOME STEPS I'MING AND INTENTUALLY MAKES THE MISTAKE SERA MAKING SURE THE ENTIRE WORLD LISTENING WREGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY COMEMEN CAN CAN FOLLOW ME HERE K SO DON'T BURN ME ON THE DETAILS RIGHT YOU'VE GOT TOS PIRUBE THE PROBLEM IS YOU CAN NO LONGER DO ANYTHING WITH THAT LI CALL THIS IS IS OVER YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE A CHOICE RIGHT IN ORDER TO MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF THOSE THREE CARBONMOLECULES YOU'VE GOT TO SHIP THEM TO THE MTO CONDRE AS WE SAID THAT IS THE ONLY PLACE OF EROBIC METABOLISM RIGHT WE CANNOT DO RUBIC MITHABOLISM ANYWHERE ELSE UNTIL WE ENTER THE MATO CONDREC ANY TIME WE CROSS THAT BARRIER WE KNOW WE'VE AUTOMATICS WHICH FROM ANEROBIC TO A ROBIC BUT HERE IS THE PROBLEM IF YOU WERE TO TAKE ONE MORE CARBON OFF THAT THREE CARBON PIROVATE YOU HALF THE NOW DO SOMETHING WITH THAT CARBON WASTE GA SO BEFORE WHEN WE SPLIT THE SIX CARBON CHAIN WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY LEAVE ANY CARBON'S FREE FLOATING WE JUST SPLIT A TO MOLECULIN OUT WHEN WE GO TO SPLIT FROM PIRUVE AND MAKE IT INTO THIS TWO CARBONMOLECULL CALLE OUSSITUE COAY OR SEAL COAY NOW WE'VE GOT A FREE FLOATING CARBON WE HALF TO EVESTRATIC YU THAT BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO INCREASE THE CIDITY LEVEL ANY ENSIM IN OUR BODY THAT WORKS TO CREATE FUEL IS VERY P H SENSITIVE RIGHT SO IF THIS TH IF P H GETS OFF EITHER HIGH OR LOW THESE ENZIM SCAN'T WORK AND THAT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE EVEN IF I WER TO GIVE YOU A DIRECT INJECTION OF EIH T P WREMER THAT'S THAT ENERGY CURRENCY IT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN ACTUALLY FORM ENERGY II B GESS AMEMBER TO CLARIFY ANY TIME WE'RE USING PHOSPHOCRETN OR GLUE COSES OR FAT WHICH WILL GET TO A SECON WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY GETTING ENERGY FOR EXERCISE BY BREAKIN THOSE DOWN WE'RE GETTING ENERGY THAT WE CAN USE TO THEN MAKE E T P WE BREAK THAT EIGH T P DOWN THAT WAS ACTUALLY POWERING MUSCEL CONTRACTION I'M YOU CAN GO BACK TO OUR PREVIOUS EPISODE OR WE WOCKD YOU THOUGH THE DETAIL OF THE MUSCL CONTRACTION BUT THAT'S WHE'REAFTER E SO IN THE CASE OF PIROVATE IF WE SPLIT THAT OFF WE HAVE GOT TO DEAL WITH THAT AND THE ONLY WAY IN THE BEST WAY WE CAN DEAL WITH THAT IS OXYGEN REMEMBER WE'RE GIN TO BREATHEIN O TO THAT O TOS CAN COMBINE WITH THAT FREE FLOATING CARBON MAKE SEA TO OR AN EXHAIL THAT THING OUT THAT'S OUR WASTE MANAGEMENT STRATEG BUT THAT HAS TO HAPPEN IN THE MITOCONDRE REMEMBER IF WE'RE USING OXYGEN AT HAS TO BE IN THE MITOCONDRE SO IF WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO SHIP PIRUVETE INDO THE MITA CONDRIAN OR GOLDEN BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF WE DON'T WHY DO WE NOT WELL IF WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MINO CONDREA OR A MITA CONDRE OR TOO SMALL OR THE TOO FAR AWAY OR WE DON'T HAVE SUFFICIENT OXYGEN OFVAILABILITY WHY DON'T WE HAVE SUFFICIENT OXION OF ILABILITY BECAUSE WE CREATED THE PIRUVATE TOO FAST AND THE DEMAND IN THE MTO CONDRIA IS EXCEEDED BY THE BUILD UP OF PYRUVEE AND SO NOW WE'RE HAVING THIS GIANT BACKLOGUE AND THIS THING FILLS UP FAST WE HAVE A COUPLE OF STRATEGES HERE WELL WHEN YOU'RE GOING THROUGH EIGH T P AND YOUR SPLITTING ITS CALLED A  BE HYDROLISIS IN OF DOING THAT REMEMBER EIGHT PES A WHAT IDENTICY MOLECLE AND THEN THE TE PART IS TRYPHOSPHAE ONE TWO THREE WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE THREE PHOSPHATES ATTACHED THE END WHEN YOU BREAK THAT PHOSPHATE OFF THAT'S WHERE YOU GET GENERGENES ON OW OU HAVE AN ENERGATIC PHOSPHATE AND AN A DP IT ESENT DI PHOSPHATE TOO THAT PROCESS REQUIRES WATERS CALLED PYDRALISIS AS RESULT OF THAT YOU THEN HAVE A FREE FLOATING HYDROGEN AND AS YOU WELL KNOW THAT IS ACID RIGHT THAT'S POTENTIAL HYDROGEN THAT'S WHAT THAT MEANS AND SO  YOU'VE INCREASE THE ACIDITY IN THE MUSCLE BY BREAKING UP ALL THIS EH T P AND SO OH WE'RE E'RE BUILDING UP ACID WE HAVE BUILDING UP PIRUVETE WE'D KNOW OF NOWHERE TO GO WITH IT AND WE CAN'T CLEAVE OFF A CARBON BECAUSE NOW WHER IS GOING EXACERBATE THE ACID INCREES SO WHAT WE CAN DO IS WE CAN TAKE THOSE HYDROGENS THAT WERE BUILDING UP AND STORE THEM ON THE PIRUVETE A PERUVATE THAT'S HOLDING AN EXTRAACID HAS A SPECIAL NAME AND WE CALL THAT LACTATE I SO THAT'S WHY WE SEE THIS BUILD UP OF LACKDATE SO ONE OF THE DOWN SIDES OF ANEROBIC I CASIS IS AND INCREDIBLY IRATE OF WASTE PRODUCTION NOW LACTATES IS NOT THE CAUSE OF FATIGUE FACT IF YOU THINK A LITTLE BIT MORE CAREFULLY ABOUT WHAT I JUST SAID IT'S ACTUALLY STOPPING YOU IT'S WHAT WE CALLED A ACID BUFFER YOU CAN ACTUAL USE IT FOR ABOUCH EVERYTHINGS YOU CAN SHIP IT TO A NEIGHBORING MUSCLE FIBR AND THE SAME MUSCLE THAT'S NOT WORKING YOU CAN SHIP IT TO THE LIVERYSHIP AT THE HEART AN A MUNCH OF OTHER PLACES AND THEN YOU CAN ACTUAL JUST WORK BACKWARDS SO IF YOU SHIP IT TO FOR EXAMPLE THE HEART AND IT'S GOT A BUNCH O MITA CONDRE THAT ARE FREE YOU CAN BRINGIN THE OXYGEN ATTACT IT TO THAT HYDROGEN MAKE WATER AND NOW YOU RITE BACK TO PYRUVETE YOU PUT TOO PIRUVIT BACK TOGETHER AND NOW YOU' JUST MAKE LUCUS SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY STORE IN THE LIVER AN THIS IS A PROCESS CALLE LYCONIA GENESIS TO THIS FANCY THIN CALLED THE CUORYCYCLE WHICH IS WHAT THE THE THE THE PROPER CYCLOHERE IS SO YOU CAN USE IT AS AT VERY POTENT FEEL SORTS OF FACT ELACT IT IS A TREMENDOUSLY VALUABLE FEEL SOURCE I'M NOWLEG FOR EXRCISE BUT FOR COGNITION AN AN A BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS SO LACT ATE IN FACT THIS IS WHY A IF YOU'VE SEEN E THE RESEARCH ABOUT PRE A EXAMN TESTING EXERCISE YOU'LL SEE A NOTICE OBE INCREASE IN EXAMSCORES IF YOU DO A TWENTY MEN ABOUT OF EXERCISE PRIOR TO TAKE THE EXAMINE I'S LARGELY IN PART PROBABLY BECAUSE OF THINGS LIKE ELEVATIONS IN LAT DAY HOW INTENSE OF EXERCISE A WOULD BE MOST BENEFICIAL I DON'T KNOW THAT EXACT ANSWER I JUST KNOW THAT A GENERALLY ANY FORM OF EXERCISES GOOD BUT IF YOU WERE TO REACH A A REASONABLY HIGH HARRATE YOUR PROBIGNEES A IN FACT THERE'S AN ACUTE AND CHRONIC ADAPTATION HERE SO FOLKS HAT EXERCISE I'VE HAVE BETTER MENORY MEMORY RETENSION SCORE AN SANXAM CETERA BUT THEN ALSO DOING IT PRIOR TO THAT EXAM I MAKEURE Y RECOVERED AND REST IN BACK DOWN A STRIP BUT YOU'LL GENTLLY PERFORM BETTER PREVIOUS GUESTD ON THE HUWERIN LAPOD GASSES THE WOS A S COLLGY PROFESSOR AN NUR SCIENTISTS AN ALSO DEEN OF COLLEGEOFARTS AND CIENCES AT NEW YORK UNIVERSAM WARE YOU WENDY SYS UKI IS UN RELIGIOUS ABOUT DAILY MORNING EXERCISE YE SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS PURPOSE OF ENHANCING LEARNING AND MEMORY AND HAS A LOT OF REALLY BEAUTIFUL DATA I CONSIDER ONE OF THE REAL PIONEERS IN THIS SPACE UM SO IF PEOPLE WANT TO LEARN MORE THEY CAN LOOK TO THAT EPISODE OR WENDY'S WORK AN WE CONPRI TO LINK TO COUPLE OF THE PAPERS BUT THIS IS FANTASTIC AND THAT IT'S INCREDIBLY CLEAR I THING FOR THE FIRST TIME I UNDERSTANDING WHAT WHAT LACTATE IS REALLY DOING UM AND ITS DISPELLING A LOT OF MISS THAT I THINK I IN A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE ARRIVE TO THE DISCUSSION ABOUT LACTA WITH WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE BOWED OF EXERCISE EXTENDS LONGER AMAZING SO IF WE WANT TO CONTINUE PASS THAT POINT WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF STRATEGY TO GET THROUGH IT RIGHT WERE STOCK WERE OUT AGAST WE HAVE TO THEN SHIP INTO THE MINO CHONDRY AND NOW WORGIN TO ENTER WHAT'S CALLED A ROBIC THE LIKE CALLTHISIS AND THIS THIS GOING TO TAKE US ANYWHERE FROM AGAIN SAY THAT NINETY SECONDS OF ALL OUT WORK UP TO REALLY TWENTY THIRTY MINUTES IN FACT IT REALLY WILL TAKE US TO UNLIMITED IF YOU LOOK AT A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARITHON RUNNER EVEN THOSE THAT ARE RUNNING SAY YOU'RE TWO HOUR MARITHON THOSE FOLKS ARE BURNING UP TO EIGHTY PER CENT CARBHIDRAE IT IT IS A IT IS NOT A FAT BURNING THING AND THE REASON IS FAT MATABOLISM IS WAIG TOO SLOW IT PROVIDES A LOT OF ENERGY BUT IT IS INCREDIBLY SLOW IF YOU'RE TRYING TO RUN A FOUR AND A HALF OR SO MEN AT MILE WREPEATED TWNTY SIX TIMES YOU HAVE TO BE MOVING FAST ARE THEY INJESTING CARBYDRY AS A FEEL SOURCE DURING THE RACE UNLESS YOU'RE ONTIN YOU DON'T KNOW THEY WON'T REALY TELL YOU THESE RESORT OF TRADE SECRETS  IT WOULD BE I WOULD SAY FAIRLY RARER TO NOT HAVE SOMETHING AND THERE'S TLL BUNCH O IFFERENT STRATIGIES IF YOU'RE GTA GO REALLY LONG LIKE SOME OF THES A LIKE CYCLING WERE THE RACES WILL BE SEVERAL HOURS THEN YOU ACTUALLY MIGHT GO TO SOME FAT AS FEEL SORCEES II KNOW A LOT OF CYCLISTS ARE USING KEETONES AONETHINGS LIKE THAT NOW BUT TRADITIONALLY MOST ENDURANCE FOLKSAR GN AB AS HEAVILY TOWARDS CAR BY HYDRATE A NOW IN ONE RESPECT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO RUN ON A CAR B HYDRATES UNTIL YOU'RE MANY HOURS IN THESE FOLKS ARE ARE YOU NIQUE CASE BUT THE AVERAGE INDIVIDUAL WHO'S DOING AN HOUR HOUR AND A HALF CARDO EVEN YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE LIMITED BY YOUR CAR BY HYDRATE STORES YOU GAN TO BE JUST FINE YOU MAN BE LIMITED BY SOME OTHER THINGS WHICH WILL MAYBE SORT O BREAK DOWN HERE A SECOND  BUT YOU'RE GIN TO BE FINEER I'M A LOTLESS FOLKS WILL TAKE CAR BOHYDRATE THOUGH VERY SPECIFIC RILES YOU WANT A YOU DO WANT TO BE CAREFUL THOUGH OF INJESTING TOO MANY FAST CAR BYHYDRATES PRIER TO YOUR EXERCISE BOUT I WE HAVE ACTUALLY HAVE THIS LITTLE THING THAS CALLED THE INSOLENT GLUCOS DOUBLE AMMNG AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS WHEN YOU AN JEST CAR BA HYDRATES IMMEDIATELY YOU'R BLUD LECOS GOES UP AND THATS DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF CAR BYHYDRATE THINGS LIKE THAT WITH THE SAME THING HAPPENS WITH EXERCISE AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IS INSOLENT WANTS TO START PULLING GLUCOS OUT OF THE BLOOD AT THE SAME TIME MUSCLE WANTS TO START PULLING GLUCOS OUT OF THE BLOOD AND SO WE HAVE THIS GIANT BULLES OF CARBAHYDRATE COME IN AND THEN ALL ASUDDEN OUR BLOOD SUGAR CRASHES AND SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING SO YOURE YOUR FIRST HALF MARITHON OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND YOU'RE IN THOSE GIANT CARALS WITH US LIKE NOW HUNDRED PEOPLE WAITING TO GO IN YOUR STANDING FOR FORTY FIVE MINUTES YOU MAY OR MAY NOT WANT A SLUG DOWN LIKE THREE OR FOUR BANANAS AN A BACLE AND AND HONEY AND THINK THINK YOU PROBABLY DON'T NEED THAT I'M NOW NOT EVERY ONE EXPERIENCES THIS DOUBLE AMMY BUT IT HAS BEEN SHOWN IN LITERATURE TO HAPPEN TO SOME PEOPLE SO YOU WANTED JUST BE LITTLE BIT CAREFUL I'M AN EASY WAY TO COMBAT THAT IS JUST PRACTISE EXACTLY WHATE YOU'R GOING TO DOING YOUR RACE IN YOUR TRAINING IT'S THE THE SIMPLEST ADVICE EVER BUT YOU'D BE STUNNED HOW MANY PEOPLE DO THINGS DURING THE RACE OF THEY FACTION NEVER DONE TO TRAINING I SUGGEST PEOPLE DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU DESCRIBE ALSO FOR ANY KIND OF COGNE OF TESTING LORSLEFOR A BIG EXAMI IS NOT THE TIME TO DESCOVER WHETHER NOT YOU CAN HANDLE TWICE IS MUCH ESPRESS SO WERE TAKEN NEW TROPIC FOR THE FIRST TIME WORDE AH OR CHANGE ANYTHING I'M IF IF INDEED THE THESQUARE ON THAT EXAMIS IS MEANINGFUL TO YOU YOU KEEP KEEP THINGS REGULAR SO T RECAPIAL WE'VE DONE HERE IS WE STARTED OFF IN THE CIDE APLAS AND WITH THIS GLUCOS MOLECULE THAT IS SIX CARBONS WE TOOK THAT THING WE SPLIT AND A HALF WE CALL THAT THING ANEROBIC LIKE HOLLSUS WE MADE A LITTLE BIT OF ENERGY BUT NOT MUCH WE TAKE THOSE THREE CARBON MLECULES WE SHIPPD THEM INTO THE MIDO CONDURE WE TAKE EACH ONE OF THOSE WE CLEA OFF ONE CARBON EACH THOSE CARBONS WE TAKE A BREATH IN WE ATTACHD THEM TO OXYGEN WE EXHAIL THEM GET RID OF THAT ENERGY WE ARE NOW FULLY INTO A ROBIC LIKE HOLLUSES EACH ONE OFTHOSE TWO CARBON MOLECULES WE RUN THROUGH THE CREBT CYCLE EACH ROUND THE CREBCYCL BURNS ONE TO CARBONS SO WE GO ONE TO ONE TOO AND NOW WE'VE GONE FROM SIX CARBON MOLECULE ALL THE WAY DOWN TO ZERO WE USED THE HYDROGENS THAT WE PULLED OFF OF THAT CREBT CYCEL RUN TO GO TO THE LECTRON TRANSPORT CHAIN FROM THERE WE MADE A WHOLE BUNCH OF E T P AND SO WE HAVE NOW FULLY METABOLIZED ONE MOLECULE OF CAR BA HYDRATE AND AT THE EN PRODUCT OF ALL OF IT IS SIMPLY E T P WATER AND SEA TO BEAUTIFUL AND LEADS ME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT MOST EVERYTHING IS REALLY ABOUT UTILIZATION WITH CARBONS AND EXHALING SEO TO IS THAT HOW I SHOULD THING ABOUT BOOK ENDING WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED THIS IS WHY WE STARTED OFF THE CONVERSATION WITH THE CIRCLE OF LIFE THIS IS REALLY A CARBON GAME THIS IS WHY WE CALL A CHEMISTRY WITH CARBON OR GANIC CHEMISTRY THAT'S WHAT THIS WHOLE THING IS ABOUT  ANY LEAVING BEANG HAS TO RUN THROUGH MATABOLISM IT'S ALL A CARBON GAME ANY LAMBING BEING HASSY  T P THIS IS ALL JUST A BIG FANCY GAME AF HOW DO I MAKE A T P AND HANDLE THE WAYS REMEMBER AND DURANCE IS ALL ABOUT WASTE MANAGEMENT FATIGUE RESISTANCE THE SAME THING AN ENERGY PRODUCTION WE'RE PLAYING A GAME HERE THE WHOLE GAME BRING AN ENERGY USE IT MITIGATE WASTE PRODUCTS SO IN THINKING ABOUT AROBIC EXERCISE OR LONG DURATION EXERCISE IN THE SCASE ANYTHING LONGER THAN FIVE MINUTES FOR THAT MATTER FIVE MENTS ALL THE WAY UP TO AN ALTRAMARATHON THE BREATHING ASSOCIATED WITH ENDURANCE EXERCISE THE HEART BEATING WHICH OF HORSEIS ASSOCIY WITH THE BREATHING INVICE VERSA IT'S REALLY ALL ABOUT BRINGING OXYGEN INTO THE SYSTEM THAT THEN ALLOWS THOSE CARBONS TO BE USED AND WITHIN THE MIGHT OF CANDRA SPECIFICALLY AND THEND CARBONDIOXIDE TO BE EXALED AS WE WORK THROUGH THE CARBONS OF THE SORT OF A BEADS ON A STRING IS THAT RIGHT UNLESS YOU'RE MOVING INCREDIBLY FAST FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND WE'RE TALKING PROBABLY NORTH OF NINETY MINUTES AN DURANCE IS REALLY NOT A GAME OF MAKING SURE I HAVE ENOUGH FEEL IT IS SIMPLY MANAGING THE WASTE PRODUCTION AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHA WE DESCRIBED YOU NEED TO BRING IN THE OXYGEN SO YOU CAN HANDLE THE CARBON THAT'S BUILDING UP AS A RESULT OF BOTH THE ANROBIC ANEROBIC LIKE CALISIS THAT'S OUR GAME HERE IF WE START TALK IN MET UN DURANCE EVENTS LONGER THAN THAT NOW WE DO HAVE TO START WORRYING ABOUT RUNNING OUT OF MUSCLI LIKE AGEN RUNNING OUT OF LIVERIC LIKAGEN ET CETERA OR IF WE ARE AT THAT TWO OUR MARK OF SON WERE MOVING VERY VERY VERY FAST BUT ANYTHING SOUTH OF THAT IS JUST MANAGAM CARBON BUILD  UP AND WE DO THAT BEST THROUGH OXYENUTILIZATION OR GETTING MORE EFFICIENT D HAVING A HIGHER CAPACITY FOR OUR ANEROBIC SIDE SO WE CAN DO THAT BY HAVING EITHER MORE LIKEAGEN IN OUR MUSCLE FO THAT LAST LONGER OR BUILDING BETTER ASI BUFFERING SYSTEMS AND THERE'S A WHOLE LINE OF SUPPLIMENTATION THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY ASCED BUFFERS AS HA WHOLE LINE OF TRAINING AS AE WHOLE LINE OF BREATHING TO MANAGE US THAT SO WE HAVE A LOT OF STRATEGIES WHERE WE CAN MAXIM AS EN DURANCE ALL WE HAVE TO DO AS GO BACK TO THE EARLIER PART OF OUR TALK WHICH IS FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THE ACTUAL LIMITING STEP AND THEN TRAIN ACCORDING TO THAT OR DO YOUR STRATEGY YOUR NUTRITION IND YOUR SUPPLIMENTATION THAT DEFEATS THAT LIMITING FACTOR FOR AN EXAMPLE IF YOU ARE TRYING TO MAXIMIZE YOUR PERFORMANCE IN THIS TWENTY SECOND MAXIMIL BURST AND YOUR STRATEGY FOR THAT WAS TO MAKE SURE YOUR MOLSIPLAKAGE IN IS SATURATED IT'S PROBABLY NOT AN A HELPATON CAUS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE LIMITED BY TOTAL FUEL YOU'RE GOING TO BE LIMITED BY YOURABILITY TO BUFERACID HOWEVER STORING MOR LIKE AGEN YOUR MUSCLE IN PREPARATION FOR A MARATHON IS A TREMENDOUSLY EFFECTIVE STRATEGY BECAUSE THAT WILL BECOME A LIMITING FACTOR SO WHAT WE CAN DO ACTUALLY NEXT IF YOU LIKE ITS WE CAN JUST WALK THROUGH THESE AND LOOK AT THE INDIVIDUAL LIMITATIONS WHERE THE FAILUR POINT HAPPENS AND THE THAT INFECTIVELY WILL OUTLINE YOUR STRATEGY FOR IMPROVING THEM SO YOU TAUGHT US ABOUT CARBRAHYDRATE USILIZATION AS A FUEL SORCE WHAT ABOUT FAT AND WHAT ABOUT PROTINE GREAT I'LL START WITH PROTINE BECAUSE IT'S EASY IT IS GENERALLY AT BEST  GOING TO REPRESENT TEN PER CENT OF YOUR ENERGY OUTWET NOW THAT WILL GROW OVER TIME IN TERMS OF IF YOU DID A SEVERAL HOUR BOUT OF EXERCISE  WHEN YOU STARTED DOING IT YOU MIGHT BE USING FIVE PERCENT OF ENERGY FROM PROTEEN N A MIRO TO TEN OR SO AND THAT HAPPENS BECAUSE YOU START RUNNING LOW AND MUSCLE LIKE A GEN YOU START RUNNING LOW ON LIVERC LIKE AGEN YOU START THEN HAVING TO PULL ENENERGY FROM ANOTHER PLACE SO LIKE AS THOSE NUMBERS GO DOWN YOU'LL SEE AND INCREASED UP TICK OF ENERGY FROM FAT AS WELL AS PROTINE HAVING SAID THAT IT'S NOT A TREMENDOUS FUEL SOURCE IT IS ONLY A ROBIC SO IT HAS TO BE OXIDIZED THOSE ARE THE SAME THING WHEN I SAY OXIDISED YOU USE OXYGEN TO BURN SOMETHING TO TO MAKE A FUE I'M SO IT'S NOT SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTOR TO ENERGY IN THAT REGARD AND UNLESS YOU'RE TALKING ALTER MARATHONS OR LONGER AND IT IS ALSO NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN ENHANCE PERFORMANCE AND SO WE DON'T REALLY TO TALK MUCH MORE ABOUT IT THAN THAT IIN TERMS O FAT AS A FUEL SOURCE NOW HERE'S E FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE WHILE CARBAHYDRATE STARTS ANEROBICALLY AND FINISHES AROBICALLY IN THE MITAL CONDURY YOU'RE USING MOSTLY THE CARBOHYDRATE IN THE EXERCISING MUSCLE TISSUE EVENTUALYU CAN PULL FROM BLOOD THAN YOU CAN PULL FROM TELIVERWITH FAT YOU HAVE A TINY AMOUNT STORED IN THE MUSCLE INTREMUSCULAR TRICLASTRISES BUT THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF FUEL YOU GET FROM FAT COMS SYSTEMICALLY INSO NOW WE HAVE A FUNDAFMENTAL AS WE ACTUALLY LETELY HAVE A TIME PROBLEM I CAN GET ENERGY FROM CARBYDRATES FASTER BECAUSE IT IS DIRECTLY THERE IF I GO TO PULLET FROM FAT I'VE GOT A PULLET FROM THE REST THE BODY WHICH IS WHY SOMEBODY WHO LOSES FAT LOSES IT FROM THEIR ENTIRE BODY DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY MAY BE ONLY EXERCISING A COUPLE OF PARTS SO THINK ABOUT A RUNNER SOMEONE WHO LOST A LOT A FAT RUNNING YOU DON'T SEE THEM JUST LOSE FA T THEIR LEGS IT COMES FROM THEIR FACE IND THEIR NECK AND EVERYWHERE WHY BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IS PULL FAT FROM THE ENTI OUR SYSTEM YOU'RE GOING TO BREAK IT DOWN THROUGH A PROCESS CALLED LYE POLICIS WHICH IS MEANS YOU BREAK IT OWN FROM THE STORED FORM I'M YOU PUT IT IN THE BLOOD AS THAT GLITER ALL BACK ONE WHICH IS THAT THREE CARBON BACKBONE IN THE INDIVIDUAL FATIACIDS IT'S GON A FLOAT THROUGH THE BOOD AS THA SEVENSTEP SYSTEM HERE ABUT WE'LL SKIP IT FOR NOW IT'S GOING O HAVE TO GET THEN UP TAKE AN END OF THE MUSCLE IN THE MOSCELE THEN HAS TO GET TAKEN UP AND RUN INTO THE MITO CONDREIT NOW THAT BACKBONE THAT THREE CARBON GLISTER ALL BACKBONE IS ACTUALLY GON A FUNCTION ALMOST EXACTLY LIKE THE THREE CARBON PIRUVE JUST GET IT IN THE MITO CONDRIA CLEAVE OFF ONE CARBON RUN IT IS ASTOCOE BOTABING BUTABLE EXACT SAME THING SUPER EASY TO METABOLIZE SMALL ENOUGH TO GO THROUGH THE MITO CONDRIA MEMBRANE THE FATY ASI CHANGE O BECOME A PROBLEM SO IF YOU HAVE A CHAIN THAT'S LONGER I'M THEN ARE EIGHT OR SO CARBONS AT HAS TO ACT TO GO THROUGH A SPECIAL TRANSPORTER ON THE SELL WALL TO GET IN AND THAT'S GOING TO BE LIMITED BY A THING CALLED CARNATINE AND YOU'RE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH THAT AS A SUPPLEMENT YOU'VE MAY HAVE TALKED ABOUT AT THESE A LOT OF PLACES AT MAKE IT I'M THAT'S GOING TO BE LIMITING FACTOR IF IT IS A SMALLER WHAT WE CALL A SHORT CHAIN OR EVEN A MEDIUM CHAIN DRIKE THES RIDE WHICH A LOT OF FOLKS HAVE HEARD OF M C T THAT'S WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT CAN ACTUALLY GO DIRECTLY THROUGH CAUSE IT'S SMALL ENOUGH TO PASS THROUGH AND YOU CAN USE IT IMMEDIATELY AS AN INRESOURCE IN EITHER CASE THE WAY THAT YOU FINALLY METABOLIES A FATYACID IS IT PROCESS WHERE YOU WOULD GO THROUGH AND TUT OFF TWO CARBONS AT A TIME WHY WOULD YOU CUT OFF TOO BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE THAT TWO CARBON ACITOCOESE YOU CAN RUN THROUGH THAT CRIBED CYCLE AGAIN BECAUSE YOU'RE CUTTING OFF TWO CARBONS AT A TIME WE HAVE A SPECIAL NAME FOR THAT OXIDATION PROCESS IT'S CALLED BATA OXIDATION THAT'S EXACTLY WHY WE CALL IT BATEOXIDATION TWO CARONS AN YOU CUT IT OFF TO MAKE THAT ACITOCOE SO YOU CAN NOTICE THE OXIDATION PASSWAY THE ELECTOR ON TRANSPORT PATHWAY IS IDENTICAL WHETHER YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CARBOHYDRATES OR THE FAT IN FACT IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER MORTA OUR POINT IF WO'RE TALKING ABOUT SIMPLY FATLOSS IT REALLY JUST IS ABOUT RUNNING THAT ELECTOR ON TRANSPORTCHAING WHETHER IT CAME FOR MA CARBOHYDRATE ORIGINAL SOURS OR A FAT ORIGINAL SOURCE IT ENDS UP IN THE MITI CONDRE AS BASICALLY EXACT SAME THING IT THEN ENDS THE END O METABOLISM AS THE SAME THING REMEMBER THE FINAL END POINT OF CARBOHYDRATE METABOLISM IS WATER A T P AND CEO TO DO YOU WANT TO GUESS THE FINAL LIN POINT OF FATMATABOLISM IT'S WATER E T P AND C O TO SO PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS HERE IF YOU WANT TO MAXIMIZE FATLOSS WHAT TYPE OF TRAINING AS BEST IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU ENJOY LONGER STEADY STATES O FANTASTIC IF YOU ENJOY INTERVALS A MAZING IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO DO A COMMIATION THAT'S MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE THAT'S GREAT TOO YOU HAVE A TON OF OPTIONS PICK WHAT YOU THINK IS A COMBINATION OF CHALLENGING NOT ALL EXERCISE SHOULD BE EASY BUT YOUL ACTUALLY ENJOY SOMEWHAT OR YOU'RE WILLING TO ACCEPT AN ANYTHING YOU ABSOLUTE HATE DON'T DO IT SOMETIMES IS VERY VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO DO HIGH INTENSITY TRAIN YOU HAVE TO REALLY BE INTERESTED IN DOING IT IF NOT AN INS UP TURNING INTO LIKE MODERATE INTENSITY TRAINNING YOU SORTO JUST CHECK THE BOX AND IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WELL IF YOU'RE JUST CHECKING THE BOX SO IF YOU'R LIKE MEN MENTALLY I DON'T HAVE IT IN ME TO DAY TO GET TO A HIGH HEART RATEAN AND THROW UP AN LAST UF COOL BUT YOU CAN JUSUSE SOME MODERATE STUADYSTAYSTUFF  THAT'S A WHEN GREAT IF YOU'RE LIKE ALL MYGOSH MORE THAN TEN STRAIHT MINUTES AND I'M SO BORD AND YOU'RE ALL MAYBE ALSO LIKE I DON'T HAVE FORTY FIVE MINUTES I GOT TO GET THIS DONE AT EIGHT MINUTES GREAT GOODIST MY INTENS INTEREVALS EITHER OFTION WILL BE EQUALL EFFECTIVE AS YOU MENTIONED EARLIER EXERCISE IS USEFUL FOR AESTHETIC CHANGES FUNCTIONALITY AND FOR LUNCHEVITY BUT WHEN THINKING ABOUT EXERCISE SPECIFICALLY FOR FAT LOSS I DO HAVE TO ASK THIS QUESTION I OFTEN HERE FROM PEOPLE THAT THEY PREFER ONE TYPE OF EXERCISE FORSES ANOTHER FORSAKE OF FAT LOSS BECAUSE CERTAIN FORMS OF EXERCISE MAKE THEM VERY HUNGRY I'M WONDERING WHETHER NOT THERE'IS ANY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE INTENSITY OR TYPE OF EXERCISE AND THE A HUNGER STIMULUS NOW I DON'T HAVE THIS PROLMY IS BASICALLY EVERYTHING MAKES ME HUNGRY IM AND YET I'M ALSO CA FASTING FOR PART OF THE DAY YET I'M ONE OF THOSE PSUDO INTERMITTENT FASTERS WHAT WOULD I MEAN BY THAT I JUST IW YOUT YOU BETWEEN ELEVEN M AND EIGT P M NATURALLY OR A I I'M NOT RELIGIOUS ABOUT IT BUT UM BUT I DON'T DO IT FOR ANY OTHER REASON EXCEPT THAT THAT TENDS TO BE WHEN I'M HUNGRY AND EXERCISE OUTSIDE OF THAT I'M IN THE MORNING TYPICALLY IN ANY CASE IS THERE A WAY THAT PEOPLE CAN DETERMINE WHAT TYPE OF EXERCISE MIGHT BE BETTER WORSE FOR THEM BASED ON ITS APPETITE STIMULATING OR INHIBITING EF FECTS BECAUSE I ALSO HERE THAT YOUIT SOME PEOPLE WILL GO FOR A LONG RUN AND THEN THEY ARE GON'T GO NOT HUNGRY FOR SEVERAL HOURS AFTERWARD OR IS THAT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHICH FUELS ARE BEING ULIZE DURING DIFFERENT FORMS OF EXERCISE THAT'S IC CULY REALLY A QUESTION I DON'T KNOW THE THE MECHANISMS I COUL EXPLAIN THAT ANSWER WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS YOURE THE SAME COMMENT FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AN OTHER WORDS PEOPLE SAY MAN IF I DO THIS YPE OF TRAINING THEN I JUST AM EXHAUSTED AND I LAY AROUND THE REST THE DAY SO MY TOTAL CLORIC EXPENDITURE IS ACTUALLY COMPROMISE AS AN AGGREGATE BECAUSE I'M DOWNT I'M THE DATA WOULD SUGGEST IN GENERAL THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN SO MOST OF THE TIME WE DON'T SEE A REDUCTION IF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY I'M WITH EITHER HIGH INTENSITY OR STEADY STAY TRAINING IN FACT YOU GENERALLY SEE I EQUAL IF NOT INCREASED IT WASS CONTNE SO THE NON EXERCISING PARTY OR DAY I'M IN ADDITION TO THE BAS AL METAMATGRATE SO FIS GOT TO YO WAS YOU DON'T SEN TO BE ROPE NOW HUNGER IS A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT THING THE ANSWER HERE IS I DO'T THINK WE HAVE TIME TO ACTUALLY DO JUSTICE ON THIS SO PERHAPS BEST TO TO NOT GETT INGTO THIS ONE YET WHE DN'T WE PUNT THIS DOWN THE ROAD TO OUR DISCUSSION ABOUT NUTRITIONS HETPECIPICALLY AND AND WEVE BACK TO ITS A WILL YOUR MARKET FOR THAT OM MEANWHILE IT SOUNDS LIKE IF ONE IS THINKING PURELY IN TERMS OF A BURNING CALORIES IT AND GETTING THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF EXERCISE TO CREATICAL OR DEFFIS IT TO CREATE FAT LOSS IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER NOT THEY BURN THOSE CALORIES USING A FORM OF EXERCISE THAT RELIZES PREDOMINANTLY ON CARBAHYDRATE FAT WERE PROACHING CRET ITS NOT THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER IT'S THA EITHER ONE WILL WORK BECAUSE WHEN WE SAY THINGS LIKE THAT IT'S IT DOESN'T E THEI'RE ACTUALLY IDENTICAL THERE ARE SOME SLIGHT DIFFERENCES AND MAYBE THOSE DIFFENCES ARE IMPORTEN FOR SOME PEOPLE AND NOT OTHERS O I SAY IS EITHER ONE IS A BIABLE STRATEGY CREAT WHAT ABOUT PROACHING IS A FUEL AS AN ACTUAL FEEL SOK YOU LIMI GOBE OURNALOGY IMAGINE THAT YOU ARE YOU WERE WITH ME A FEW WEEKS GO IN SOUTHERN MONTANA AND WE ARE OUT UM IN THE WILDENESS FOR A WEEK EH AND IT'S COLD OUT THERE YOU NEEDED TO MAKE A FIRE AND IF I SAID LOOK YOU CAN PICK ANY OF THESE THINGS THERE ARE SO THERE SOME WOOD OVER THERE WE BROUGHT SOME NEWSPAPER AND THN WE BOUHT A MATCH AND WE EED A CRATE A FIRE REOUSE THAT FIRE TO ENERGY ANG HEAT UP O KT I SAID GREAT THE VERY FIRST PLACE YOU WOULD PROBABLY START TO MAKE THAT FIRE IS THE MATCH YOU LIKE THE MATCH AND ANY MATCH EH AND THE LIGHT IMMEDIATELY BUT ITS PROBLYGANTY LAST FIVE TO TWENTY SECONDS I NO BEFORE I BURNS OUT THAT'S PHOSPHIL CREATING REAL FATS RELL BURNS OUT IF YOU WERE SMART YOU WOULD TAKE THAT MATCH AND ENLIGHT THE NEWSPAPER ON FIRE RIGHT NOW IF YOU WERE TO BURN A WHLE NEWSPAPER  IT IS MORE ENERGY THEN YOU GET TO THE MATCH BUT YOU STILL IN O ATONNO WAS INGTO TAKE A FEW MINUTES SOME NUMBER OF MINUTES BEFORE AN ENTIRELY PE BYBURNS OF AP FIE I DON'T NOW RIGHT THE PENSNT TEN WHICH TYPE A NEWSPAPER AS I GUESS RIGHT AMAZING THAT'S CARBAHYDRATE RIGHT IF YOU WERE REALLY SMART YOU WOULD USE THAT SAID THEN LIGHT O PIECE OF WOOD ON FIRE AND WOOD IF YOU'VE BEENI THE WILDERNESS IT COUT LAST HOURS DAYS IT'S REALLY QUITE UNLIMITED YOU'RE PHOSPHOR CREATING STORAGE IS VERY LIMITED SMALL PLIKE AGEN IS A LOT HIGHER CUS YOU CAN STORE IN MUSTLY CONSTORED IN OTHER PLACES SO YOU HAVE MORE BUT NOT A LOT FAT IS UNLIMITED THE AVERAGE PERSON IF YOU WERE ON TO SAY SEVENTY KEYLOS UP HUNDRED AND SEVENTY POUNDS OR SO AND YOU'RE MODERATELY LAME MAYBE FIFTEEN PER CENT BODY FAT NOTHING CRAZY YOU PROBABLY HAVE ENOUGH STORED FAT TO CREATE ENOUGH ENERGIESIS TO SURVIVE FOR MORE THAN THIRTY DAYS RIGHT THIS WOULD LITTRALLY BE IF YOU INJESTED ZEROL CALORIES YOU HAVE A NOUGH FUEL IN YOUR STORED FAT TO KEEP YOU ALIVE FOR CERTAINLY THIRTY DAYS YOU WOULN FEEL GOOD ALL THOSE THINGS BUT ENERGETICALLY BASICALLY FAT WILL NEVER EVER BE YOUR LIMITING FACTORED PERFORMANCE SO WE START TALKED ABOUT WHAT LIMITS MY PERFORMANCE IN THIS ARIAS YOU CAN JUST WHITE FAT OFF THE LIST IT WILL NEVER BE YOUR LIMITING PACTOR TO ANY TYPE OF ENDURANCE PERFORMS YOU SIMPLY HAVE WE TOO MUCH THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH FAT IS IS JUST TO SLOW I'VE GOT A MOBILIZE IT I'VE GOT A GET IN THE BLOOD MOVE IT THAT WHOLE THINGTOOSLOW SO IF I WANTA GO FASTER I WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO FULLY UTILIZE FAT WHICH IS WHY WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER YOU'LL NEVER SEE A SITUATION IN WHICH SOMEBODY IS A HUNDRED PER CENT BURNING FATUS OF FUEL AND NO PER CENT CARBOAHYDRATE IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE TOO SLOW HIGHEST YOU'LL GET MAY BE SEVENTY SO PER CENT PROTENE IN THIS EQUASION IS NONE OF THAT NOW YOU MAY NOTICE HOW DO YOU MAKE PAPER BUTS FIRIRSO MINE WITH WATER IT YOU GETS PRESSED TO GET'S BE COMPRESSED YE YE IT'S MADE FROM WOOD HOW DO YOU MAKE A MACH IT'S MADE FROM WOOD WHAT'S CARBO HYDRATE A CHAIN OF CARBON WHAT'S FAT A CHAIN O CARBON THESE ARE SIMILAR MOLECULES RIGHT THERE MEANT TO GIVE YOU PROSE IN COLONS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO JUST LIGHT A LOG ON FIRE WITHOUT A LOT OF WORKINUG OUV TO BURN BURN BURN BURN BURN SO THESE ARE COMPLIMENTARY SYSTEMS THAT ARE REALLY CLOSE TO THE SAME THING PROTENE IS NONE OF THOSE THINGS PROTENE IS MORE LIKE A PIECE OF METAL SO IF YOU ARE OUT IN THE WOODS WITH ME AND WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE A FIRE AND YEAR LIKE HAYLOOCK I'VE FOUND SOME OLD A RAILROAD OVER THERE LET'S THROW THAT ON THERE I WOULD PROBABLY LOOK AT YOU LECURAES NOW TECHNICALLY CAN YOU MELT METAL SURE BUT YOU'RE GOING TO BURN A LOT OF ENERGY TO TRY TO GET A LITTLE BIT BACK OUT OF THE METAL AND NOW YOU'VE ALSO COST YOURSELF A VERY VERY VALUABLE STRUCTURE SO PROTINE IS A FUEL SOURCE FOR EXERCISE OR MATABLIS IS TIS AN INCREDIBLY POOR CHOICE YOUR BODY WILL DO IT AGAIN MAY BE FIVE TO TEN PER CENT BUT YOU NOW YOU'RE BURNING A VERY VALUABLE SUPPLY IN A SITUATION IN WHICH YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THERE'S EVER GOING TO BE ANY MORE REMEMBER PROTINE IS FAIRLY TRANSIENT IT'SN'N YOU'RE NOT VERY GOOD STORING IT YOU CAN STORE A TON OF CARBO HYDRATE AND AN UNLIMITED LITERALLY AMOUNT OF FAT SO YOU JUST REALLY NEED A DISREGARD THINKING ABOUT PROTEENE AS A FUEL SOURCE YOUR BODY DOES NOT WANT TO DO IT YOU'RE NOT GOOD AT IT YOU CAN GO THROUGH A PLOCESS OF LUCONEOGENESIS FROM PROTENE MAKE LUCOS FROM IT IS JUST VERY POOR YOU'RE NOT GING TO GET MUCH OUT OF THE EXCHANGE AND YOU'VE BURNED YOUR SUPPLY OF METAL WHICH IS GOINGTO BE VERY DIFFICULT A IT'S A VERY HIGH COMMODITY IN THE WOODS SIR THE WILDERNESS TO HAVE SOMETHING LIKE METAL FOR PEOPLE THAT CONSUME VERY LOW CARBO HYDRATE OR S YOUR CARBOR HYDRATE DIETS AR THEY PULLING MORE ENERGY FROM MUSCLE SO WHICH I IMAGINE IS A CONVERSION OF THE MENOACITS INTO READY CARBONTRINS YE I MEAN IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE WHENCE YOU'VE REACHD A A CERTAIN LEVLL OF ADOPTATION YOU'VE JUST GOTT AN EXTREMELY GOOD AT GENERATING GLUEC OS FROM OTHER FASHIONS RIGHT SO YOU CAN BY US HEAVILY TOWARDS FADADAPTATION THE DOWNSIDE IS AND WE'VE SEEN THIS BORN IN LITERATURE YOU'RE GOING TO PERFORM SLOWER SO IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT MAXIMISING PERFORMANCE ESPECIALLY OVER SOMETHING WHERE IT IS A MAXIMAL EFFORT FOR A FEW MINUTES OR SOMETHING THEN MAY BE OU'RE NOT CONCERNED AND THAND THATS EBSLLYGRATE ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE JUST DON'T EXERCISE THEN HAT GES VERY LITTLE CONCERNING HERE BUT IF YOURE INTEREST IN YOUR PERFORMANCE IN YOU'RE WONDERING WHY YOU DISLIKE SLUGGING IT DOWN WHAT YOU'VE DONE IS YOU'VE DOWN REGULATED THE ABILITY LITTLELY THE ENDSIMS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT ENTIRE ANEROBIC LI CALLS IS PORTION THEY GET DOWN REGULART WHICH MEANS HERE'S NOT AS MUCH AROUND ANY MORE AND SO YOU GET REALLY BAD AND SLOW USING CARBIDERS AS IF YOU'LL SOR SO IS A VERY POOR STRATEGY FOR PEOPLE ON N ANEROBI BA SPORT OR WHO LIKE THAT TYPE OF ACTIVITY CANT YOU DON'T CARE NO PROBLEM I IF YOU DON'T ACCISE AT ALL THAN YOU REALLY HAVE NO PROVEM THERE WHICH IS ACTUALLY WHY A HIGH FAT LOW CAR BEHYDRATE NUTRICIAN STRATEGY FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T DO MUCH PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IS PROBABLY LIKE VERTWEMEN IT'S VERY EFFECTIVE ITIT IS A RUEALLY GET STRATEGY FOR WEIGHT MANAGEMENT FOR ENERGY STABLIZATION THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND THE RESEARCH WOULD VERY MUCH SUPPORT THAT IN MY OBSERVATION I WOULD AGREE I'VE TRIED LOCARBORHYDRATE DIETS OF SEVERELY LIMITING OR COMPLETELY LIMITING CARBOHYDRATE AND AFTER ABOUT TWO OR THREE DAYS I FEEL PRETTY LOWSY BUT MOSTLY BECAUSE I WANT TO TRAIN VERY INTENSE LII IN THE GEM IN ADDITION TO DOING LONGER RUNS I TEND TO DO ALL OF THOSE THINGS ACROSS THE WEEK A BUT I'VE ALSO OBSERVED AND IN FACT NO SEVERAL PEOPLE THAT LOVETHY VERY LOW CARBOHYDRATE A A KEE TO KEETOGANIC TYPE DIET THEY'RE NOT DOING KEETER GANDIETS FOR MENTAL HEALTH'S REASONS PERSAY A BUT INDEED THOSE PEOPLE TEND TO DO VERY LIMITED EXERCISE OR THEY TEND TO DO A LOT OF LONG ENDURANCE BUT LOW INTENSITY LONG ENDURANCE THESE ARE THE I WALK TO GET MY EXERCISE TYPES AND THEY DO INDEED WALK A LOT AND SOME OF THEM MENGE TO I'M CONTROL THEIR WIGHT VERY READILY AND LIKE THAT DITE FOR THAT REASON A WHEN WE HAD LANGNORON ON THE PODCAST HE 'M POINTED OUT QUITE APTLY THAT IN ORDER TO LOSE WEIGHT YOU HAVE TO RESTRICT SOMETHING ITHER WORSE TIME OR A MACKRONUTRANCE ET CETERA TO ARRIVE AT THAT I'M SUBCLORIC THRESHOLD I'M GET BELOW THAT IT'S A SUBMANTENANCE THRESHOLD I GUESS ONE OFTHE THINGS I WANT TO POINT OUT IS THIS SHOULD BE RECEIVED AS AGAN NOT AID THIS IS BETTER OR WORSE THIS IS IS YOU NOW HAVE A TINE OF OPTIONCE SO WHATEVER PERSONAL PREFERENCE OTHER FACTORS YOU GET TO CRAFT IS STRATEGY OF PERFORMANCE ESTHETICS AND HEALTH BASED ON YOUR PERSONAL PREFERENCES AT THIS POINT I'D LIKE TO GO BACK TO OUR CLASSIC LIST OF NINE ADAPTATIONS THAT EXERCISE CAN INDUCE THE FIRST FOR OF COURSE BEING LARGELY LARGELY UNRELATED TO DAYS CONVERSATION BUT THAT WERE COVERED IN THE EPISODE THAT WE DID ON STRENGTH SPEED AND IPER SO JUST REMIND PEOPLE THE NIN ADAPTATIONS OUR NUMBER ONE SKILLIN TECHNIQUE TO SPEED THREE POWER WHICH IS SPEED TIMES FORCE FOR STRENGTH AND FIVE HYPURTROPHE TO DAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE REMAINING ADAPTATIONS ON THAT LIST STARTING WITH MUSCULAR ENDURANCE FOLLOWED BY INEROBIC CAPACITY FOLLOWED BY MAXIMAL AROBIC OUTPUT AND FINISHING AT NUMBER NINE WITH LONG DURATION EXERCISE SO IF WE COULD START WITH MUSCULAR ENDURANCE THIS WOULD BE A NUMBER SIX ON THE LIST OF NINE ADAPTATIONS MUSCULAR ENDURANCE HOW DO I BUILD MUSCULAR ENDURANCE WHY SHOULD I BUILD MUSCULAR ENDURANCE AND JUST TO REMIND ME WHAT FUEL SOURCES OUR PREDOMINATING WHEN I'M TRAINING FOR MUSCULAR ENDURANCE GREAT SO REMEMBER MUSCULAR ENDURANCE IS SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE GENERALLY IN A LOCAL MUSCLE IT IS NOT A CARTY OF ASCER OR SYSTEMIC ISSUE AND IT TENDS TO BE SOMETHING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF SAY FIVE TO MAYBE EVEN UPTO FIFTY REPETITIONS SO THIS IS THE CLASK EXAMPLE GAVE HERES HOW MANY PUSHUPS CAN YOU DO IN A RUPE MOST PEOPLE ARE TO LAND SOMEWHERE THAT RANGE IT JUST SAID HOW MANY SITUPS CAN YOU DO IN AMENOND HOW MANY PULL UPS HOW LONG CAN YOU HANG ON A BAR A IS A DEAD HANG THINGS LIKE THAT THAT'S MUSCU NDURANCE MUSCULAR ENDURANCE IS NOT A MILE RUN OR A MARITHONANAM LIKE THAT SO E HOW LONG CAN I STAND WHITHOUT BREAKING POSTURE THIS IS MUSCULAR NDURANCE A PLANK O WALTS IT A GREAT YES LOVE ALL THESE THINGS I CAVE NOW THE REASON I TOOK YOU ON THAT BIG LONG THE TABILISM DURNIY IS SO I COULD HELP YOU UNDERSTAND EXACTLY HOWTO TRAIN THIS FACT OR ANY THESE FACTORS WITH A MORE COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING WAS HAPPENING MEANING THINKING BACK THO MHE TABILISM IF I'M GONG O ASK MY TRICEPS TO DO FIFTY PUSH UPS IN A ROW WHAT'S GOING TO BE MY LIMITING FACTOR AM I GOING TO RUN OUT OF FAT NO CHANCE AM I GOING TO RUN OUT OF LIKE AGENT NO CHANCE THAT'S A WAY TO FEW OF REPETITIONS YOU HAVE A LOT LEFT THERE SO WHAT'S GOINGTO BE TO THING THAT STOPS ME FROM GETTING FIFTY ONE REPETITIONS EITHER YOU'REGOING TO HAVE TOO HIGH OF A P GE RISE SO TOO MUCH ACID BUILD U OR YOU'RE RUNG TO HAVE A PROBLEM CLEARING THE WAST SO REALLY THIS IS TWO FACTORS DEALING WITH ASCID BUILD UP AND GETTING ACID OUT OF THE MUSCLE TISSUE AND END TO CIRCULATION CAUSE YOU HAVE PLENTY OF ABILITY TO HANDLE THAT SMALL AMOUNT OF ASCID BUILD UP IN YOUR ENTIRE BODY IT'S SUS YOU CAN'T HANDLE IT IN THAT TINY SPOT NOW I PICK THE TRICEP FOR A VERY SPECIFIC REASON YOU'RE GING TO DEAL WITH MORE PAIN WHEN YOU USE A LARGE MUSCLL GROUP LIKE YOUR QUADS YER GLUTES THAN YOU ARE WITH A SMALL MUSCEGROUP FOR EXAMPLE NOBODY EVER THREW UP AFTER ARMDAY BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE THROW UP AFTER LEG DAY WHY IS THAT LOOK AT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF WASTE THAT YOU'R DUMPING IN YOUR SYSTEM WHEN YOU HAVE QUADROUPLED OR TENAXS THE MUSCLE SIZE SMALL MUSCLE GROUPS ARE ONLY REALLY GOING TO BE CHALLENGED IN THAT LOCALARIAT LARGE ONES WILL DUMP SO MUCH WASTE IN THE SYSTEM THAT YOU'LL WANT AVOID THAT AS QUICKLY ASE POSSIBLE AND THT'S ONE F THE REASONS WHY YOU THROW UP AFTER HARD EXERCISE GREAT SO THE REASON LAUGHING BECAUSE I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER THROWN UP A FROM A WAY TRAINING SESSION AND SO IT'S MAKING ME WONDER IF I'VE EVER TRAINED THAT HARD I RECEIVED A OR OBTAIN THE PROGRESS THAT I WANTED TO GENERALLY OVER TIME NOT EVERY WEEK EVERY WORK OUT EVERY MONTH AA BUT CERTAINLY OVER THE THIRTY PLUSSIERS THAT I WAY TRINING A'VE ACHIEVED THE THE RESULTS I' WANT I HAVE HOWEVER AVOMITED AFTER A LONG RUN WHEN I DIDN'T HIDDRATE WELL A YOU RE IF I DRANK TOO MUCH WATER SIR OH SIR TOO MUCH WATER YET YOU'LL YOU'LL GET THAT OUT QUICK I JUST A ONE O BE CLICK AUSE I THINKS OF YOU ARE GETTING THE PICTURE THAT IF THEY'RE NOT VOMITING THEAFTER THEY'RE LEG WORK OUT THAT THEY'RE NOT TRAINING ACCORDING TO AT YOUR STANDARDS AGAIN BY THE WAY IM DOCTOR AND GALPAN RUNS EXPERIMENTS IN'S LAVEY'S RECRUITING SUBJECTS I ALSO NONICE MY GRADUAL SUDENTS ANS RIGHT I NAYTHANT SORRY TO INTERRUPT A BUT I THELGT IT WAS THE NECESSARY INTERRUPTION SO MUSCULAR ENDURANCE THERE'S PLENTY OF FUEL PLENTY OF FUEL YOU MANAGE ASCID BUILD UP AND YOU ALL SEEMNG TO GET THAT FUEL ADYOU THAS'S CAN TO BE A CAPLARIZATION ISSUE SO THE WAY THAT WE CAN THINK ABOUT THIS IS CAPILERIES SURROUND YOUR MUSCLE AND THE WHOLE POINT OF THEM IS SO THAT BLOOD CAN COME INTO THEM THEY HIT THIS CAPLARIZATION THAT ACTUALLY SLOWS THE DIFFUSION RADE OF BLOOD DOWN AND SO YOU CAN EXCHANGE NEUTRENTS IN AND GET WASTE PRODUCTS OUT AND THEN WE GET THINGSE BACK IN A CIRCULATION SO THE MORE OF THOSE YOU HAVE THE BETTER YOU ARE AT DISPERSING ANY OF THESE WASTE PRODUCT BUILT UP WHETHER IT SEAL TO OR THE ASCID SO THE ADAPTATION YOU'RELOOKING FOR HERE IS AN INCREASING CAPILATIZATION POTANTIALLY AS SLIGHT INCREASE IN MYLE CANDRIA BUT THE TIME IS TOO FAST RIGHT SO WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO D TO DO THESE FIFTY REPETITIONS AN SAY UNDER A MINUTE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO GETTING THE MOBILIZATION IN THE MINOR CONDRA GETTING FUEL THAT WAY WHO SLO IT'S NOT REALLY GOING TO GET OUR PERFORMANCE YOUE SO WHAT AR STRATEGIES TO INCREASE ASCID BUFFERING ABILITY AND THEN CAPILARIZATION SO ON THE CALPLIATIZATION SIDE YOU SIMPLY NEEDED TRAIN AT THAT ABILITY SO YOU GO CLOSE TO FAILURE AND PRACTICE THAT OFTEN THAT ALONE WILL INCLEASE INCREASE BLOOD FLOW TO THAT LOCAL ARIA WHICH WILL GATE TAKE YOU THOUGH YOUR PROCESS OF INCREASING CALPITIZATION EASY PEACY SPECIFICITY SJUST TO BRIEFLY ENTERRUPT I FIND IT REMARKABLE THOUGH NOT SURPRISE IN GIVING HOW AMAZING THE HUMAN BODY IS THAT SIMPLY BY DOING SOME MOVEMENT REPEAT LEKE WALLSAD OR A A OR PUSHUPS OR DIPS FOR THAT MATTER REP EEDEDLY OVER AND OVER AND OVER UNTIL YOU REACH THAT FAILURE POINT YET THERE WERE THAT QUAKING POINT IN THE CASE OF A WALL SIT THAT PROVIDES A STIMULUS FOR MORE CAPALARIES TO BE BUILT INTO THE SYSTEM LITERALLY THE THE PRODUCTION IN ORE THA UM THE TRAFFICING OF ENDOTHELIAL SELLS WHICH MAKE UP THE CAPALARIES AND EXALLOW BASY MORE LITTLE PIPES TO FEED THE SYSTEM WITH OXYGEN AND REMOVE WASTE PRODUCTS IT'S LIKE IRREGATION RIGHT IMAGING OUT A GIANT FIELDING HAD TWO BIG PIPES TRAYING DOWN THE OUTSIDE WELL IN FACT IF YOU WNT TO MAKE SURE WATER GETS EVEN THE DISPERST ACROSSING TIREFIELD YOU'LL HAVE A BUNCH OF OFF SHOOTING LITTLE PIPES AND THE MORE THOSE YOU HAVE THE MORE COVERAGE YOU GET DO WE KNOW WHAT THE THE SPECIFIC SIGNAL IS THAT SAYS HEY I FAILED AT THIS WE NEED MORE CAPALARIES ACT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS I COULD I WOULD SPECULATE ITS A COMBINATION OF A ACIDITY AS WELL AS CARBONIOXCIDE AND PROBABLY SOME NITROCOXSIDE STEFF HAPPENING THERE BUT I ACT YY DON'T KNOW I'M GUESSING NOBODY KNOWS FOR SURE BECAUSE WE STILL DON'T KNOW FOR INSTANCE WHAT THE EXACT SIGNAL IS FOR HYPERTROPHY IT'S KIND OF AN AMAZING SITUATION WE KNOW THE REQUIREMENTS FOR GETTING THEE ESOLLY WANT YEBUT WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SPECIFIC SIGNAL IS UM IN ANY EVENT WHAT I'M HEARING IS BUILDING MORE CAPALARIES IS GRAT FOR ENHANCING MUSCULAR ENDURANCE AND THE WAY TO GET MORE CAPALARIES INTO THOSE MUSCLES IS TO TRAIN FOR MUSCULAR ENDURANCE BY GETTING CLOSE TO FAILURE OR TO SOME POINT WHERE YOU SIMPLY CAN'T CONTINUE FOR WHATEVER REASON COULD YOU GIVE US AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT A REASONABLE TRAINING PROTOCALL MIGHT BE IN TERMS OF UM THE CLASSIC GALLOPING LISTS NOW EH EXERCISE CHOICE MAYBE A FEW UM OPTIONS ORDER VOLUME AND FREQUENCY GREAYT WHAT SHALL WE BE DOING HOW OFTEN SHALL WE BE DOING IT AND YON FOR INCEN SHI DO WALSITS TO FAILURE THAN PUSH UPS TO FAILURE I GIVEN THAT THIS IS A LOCAL PROCESS I'M GUESSING THAT IF I DO PUSH UP TO FAILURE I'M NOT GETT INCREAE THE NUMBER OF CAPLRIES IN MY LEGS VERY MUCH CORRECT SO YOU KNAILED IT EXERCISE CHOICE IS HIGH PRECISION HERE SO PICK THE MUSCLE GROUP AND THE EXACT SEQUENCING AND MOVEMENT PATTERN YOU WANT HYG PROCISION THIS IS THE THING IF YOU WANT ING IT BETTER TO PLANK HOLD A PLANK A NEW MORE PUSH UPS TO MORE PUSHIPS YOU CAN DO SOME OTHER STUFF THAT'S COMPLIMENTARY BUT REALLY THIS IS A HIGH PRECISION GAME DO THE EXACT SAME THING FOR EXERCISE CHOISE VERY SIMPLAR GAIN TERMS OF EXERCISE ORDER I SPASE THIS DOVE TAILS WITH VOLUME YE CAN I COMBINE UM TRAINING LET'S A WALSITS FOR MY QUADS AND REIN O NEAR BY MUSCLE GROUPS AND THEN DO PUSH UPS TO FAILURE A AND THEN ALSO DO SOME SORT OF A PULLING EXERCISE TO FAILURE YET ABSOLUTEY AGAN PICK THE EXERCISES YOU WANT THE MOVING PATERNTS YOU WANT TO DO AND DO THEM THE ORDER ALMOST DOESN'T MATTER WITH THE ONE CAVIOT WITH LARGER MUSSL GROUPS PARTICULARLY AGAIN MOLTIPULL LAG ACTIVITIES THAT WILL INDUCE A SSMALL AMOUNT OF SYSTEMIC FATIGUE AND S IF YOU I GUESS THEORETICALLY WANTED A MAXIM ISE YOUR PUSH UP NUMBER AND YOU DID A WHOLE BONCH OF SAY SPLITSQUAPS IAND YOU JUST DID THOSE AN AND YOU YOU YOU DID LUNGEIS FOR A MILE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY SLIGHTLY COMPROMISE YOU MIGHT NOT BUT YOU MIGHT SLIFELLY COMPROMISE YOUR ABILITY TO DO AS MANY PULLUPS IN ERAL OR HOLD A BENT OVER OVER SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO IF YOU REALLY CARED ABOUT THAT LEVEL I'M THEN YOU MAY BE WANT TO DO THE THING THAT'S MOST IMPORTANT FIRST IN GENERAL MY RECOMMENDATION THOSE TO DO THE BIGGER MUSCEL GROUP FIRST HOW MANY SETS AND HOW OFTEN SHOULD ONE PERFORM TRAINING FOR MUSCULAR ENDURANCE AND WHEN NOW THE LOVELY PART HERE AS WE'VE MOVED DOWN THE SPECTRAM PAST HYPERTROPHY YOU DON'T NEED A LOT OF LOAD HERE IN FACT THE LOAD ONLY NEEDS TO BE AT OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE WHAT YOU WANT TO MOVE SO IF YOU WANT TO GET BETTER AT MOVING FIFTY PER CENT OF YOUR WONEER AT MAX YOU DON'T REALLY NEED TO TRAIN MUCH MORE THAN FIFTY MAYBE FIFTY FIVE OR SIXTY PER CENT OF YOUR WONE ER A MAX BECAUSE IF YOU GO HIGHER THAN THAT THE REPETITION COUNTS GOING TO FALL AND YOU'RE NO LONGER GOING O BE TRAINING MUSCOW END DURANCE SO YOU JUST NEED TO STAY RIGHT AROUND THAT NUMBER THAT YOU WANT A WORK ON SO AGAIN IF THE TARGET IS DOING MORE PULLOPS AND ASSUMING THAT YOU HAVE THE STRENGTH TO DO IT YOU CHECK THAT BOX YOU SIMPLY NEED TO PRACTICE THE REPETITION RANGE THAT YOU WANT TO BE IN THAT'S ALL IT TAKES YOU CAN REPEAT THAT A NUMBER OF TIMES BUT BECAUSE REMEMBER THE VOLUME IS FAIRLY LOW THE LOAD IS VERY VERY LOW YOU CAN ACT YOU REPEAT THESE QUITE FREQUENTLY S YOU WON'T GET EXTREMELY SORE FOR MUSCO ENDURANCE RELATIVE TO TRADITIONAL HYPERTRY STRAINING BECAUSE THE LOAD IS VERY VERY LIKHES YOU CAN DO THESE MORE FREQUENTLY IF YOU WOULD LIKE MORE FREQUENTLY SUCH AS YOU CAN DO A THREE OR FOUR TIMES A WEEK EASY IF YOU'D LIKE YOU DON'T NECESSARILY NEED TO THREE DAYS A WEEK PER MUSCELE GROUP IS PROBABLY FINE HERE I'M IF YOU WANTED TO DO MORE SETS ON A GIVEN DAY AND DO LESS DAYS THAT WOULD BE FIND SO IF YOU ANTEO DO TWO DAYS A WEEK AND YOU SAY WANTED TO DO LET'S SAY YOU COULD DO TWENTY FIVE PUSH UPS AND THE GOAL IS TO GET TO THIRTY PUSHUPS JUST AS AN EXAMPLE YOU MIGHT SAY O KEM I'M GOING TO DO SETS OF SEVENTEEN I 'M TO DO THREE SETS O THAT IM DO THAT THREE DAYS WEEK THAT'S GOING TO BUILD UP QUITE A BIT OR YOU COULD SAY LOOK I'M ING TO DO SET BASITLY TO FAILURE I'M RECOVER AND DO ONE OR TWO SETS THAT SAY EIGHTY PER CENT IND I'LL DO THAT TWICE A WEEK THAT'S GOING TO PUSH THE PACTEPORTO WHEL YOU CAN HAVE A LOT OF I GAINS FROM THAT AND AGAIN THIS IS NOT ABOUT HYPERTUPY THIS IS ABOUT MUSCULAR ENDURANCE R I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE AND BEAN PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M I'M TALKING OUT OF LINE HERE DO WANT EMPHASIZE IT BECAU WE MENTION PULLUPS YOU IF YOU CAN'T GET TWENTY FIVE PULLOPS THEN AND YOU'RE DOING TEN YOU'RE TRAINING FOR HYPERTFOR YOU'RE NOT TRAINING FOR MUSCULAR ENDURANCE PETHERER THERE'S A BIG CROSS OVER HERE SO ANY TIME WE'RE TALKING PASS LIKE FIFTEEN RAPS WERE TACHNICALLY IN HYPERCHIRY AND MUSCULAR UNDERGOT IT SO HERE'S A COMMOSTAKE I DON'T WANT TO GET BULKY SO I'M I'M MI TO GO LIGHTER IN DO MORE RAPTS AND THEN PEOPLE GROW AND THEN YOU LANDIT STILL RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF HYPERTRY RAN RAT SO THEY LIKE TRIBUWERE LIKE ALL MY GODS LIKE EVERYTIME I LIFT AWAISHTS I BLOW UP I GO LIGHTER I DO MORE RAPS ON IT JU STILL RIGHT IN HE PERTRES THEY'D DAST SHAL BE MUCH BETTER OFF TRAINING VERY VERY HEAVY IN THE ONE TO THREE REPRINGSH BEING THEY GET REALLY STRONG AND THEY WOULDN'T GROW MUCH EXACTLY SO TELL ME IF THIS IS A REASONABLE PRO TO CALL FOR WHAT I'M GOING TO CALL THE TYPICAL PERSON IN MY MIND THE TYPICAL PERSON SOMEBODY WHO HOPEFULLY IS DOING RESISTANCE TRAINING HITTING THAT TEN SETS PERMUSCELE GROUP PER WEEK MINIMUM YET TO MAINTAIN OR BUILD STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHY BUT IS ALSO DOING SOME LONG DURATION TRAINING THAT WILL TALK ABOUT AN I BIT MAYBE THROWING IN THA HIGH INTENY WORK OUT HERE OR THERE SOME SPRINTS MAYBE SOME PLIMATTRICKS SOME SKILL BASE TRAINING YHEY DONG A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT THINGS YET TO BE ALT WHAT I WOULD CALL ALL AROUND FIT YET HEY'RE NOT TRAINING FOR ANY SPECIFIC EVENT OR TRYIN TO MAXIMISES ANY ONE OF THE NINE ADAPTATIONS TO THE EXCLUSION THE OTHERS THAT PERSON DECIDE OK AFTER AM THEY DO THEIR LONGER RUN THEY'RE GOING TO DO A MAX TIME A PLANK TO MAXDURATION THEY'REGOING TO WALLSIT TO MAXDURATION AND THEY DO PUSH UP SOME AXTURATION AND THEN ALSO DO THAT SAME WORK OUT BEFORE THEY DO THEIR HIGINTENSY INTERVAL TRAINING SOME OTHER POINT DURING THE WEEK AND THEN MAYBE EVEN DO IT AAGAIN AM ON THEIR A SO CALLED REST DAY JUST A REAL QUACK FIVE MINUTES ADOR AND IN DOING SO BUILD MORE CAPLARIES INTO THE RELEVANT MUSCLE GROUPS AND BUILD THEIR MUSCULAR ENDURANCE YET WITHOUT EATING INTO THEIR OVER ALL RECOVERY TOO MUCH TOO MUCH YES SO AGAIN THE NICE PART ABOUT THIS IS THEY DON'T HAMMER YOU TOO MUCH YOU'RE NOT GING TO GET TREMENDOUSLY SORE IF YOU KEEP THE LOAD LIGHT THE ONLYS WHICH IU MAKE THEIRS I WOULD PROBABLY DO THEM AFTER YOU'RE INTERVAL RATHER THAN BEFORE SO YOU CAN MAKE SURE YOU KEEP QUALITY THERE AN YOURE NOT COMPROMISE BY A LOCAL MUSCER AN DURANGE WHEN YOU'R ACTUALLY TRYING TO GET A MORE SYSTEMIC FATIGUE WITH SOMETHING LIKE A HIRINPENCITY INTERVAL TRAING SO THAT WOULD WORK FANTASTIC THE ONLY OTHER VARIABLE WE HAVEN'T IT ON HEROS PROGRESSION AND THIS IS VERY SIMPLE TRY TO ADD A REP OR TO PER WEEK THAT'S REALLY I AFTER GAFTER SO IF YOU'RE UP TO TWENTY TWO THIS WEEK TRYDAY AT TWENTY THREE NEXT WEEK OR FOR WALLSITS IN PLANKSTHAT WOULD BE AT IT AT TIME TIME YAND IF AND IF YOU RUN INTO A WALL THERE JUST LIKE THE SAME CONCEPTS WE TALKED ABOUT WITH STRYING TH IPERTHRY BACK IT DOWN THE MORE LIKE IN THE EIGHTY OR EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT RANGE AND ACCUMULATE A LOT MORE PRACTICE THAT'S CAN T HELP A LOT WITH CAPITIZATION AS WELL AS ASK I BEFFERINGS SO YOU CAN CONTINUE TO GIVE YOURSELF SIGNALS FOR OPEREGULATION I'M OF THE PROCESSIES NEEDED FOR THAT AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS PUSHING YOU TO THE END AND YOU'RE JUST LIKE WE DON'T WANT ALWAYS GO TO FAILURE OF STRENGTH WE DON'TT ALWAYS GO TO FAILURE WITH HINTENS ANEROLS EITHER SAME THING WOULD BE HAPPENING HERE WHAT ABOUT ANEROBIC CAPACITY HOW SHOULD PEOPLE TRAIN FOR ANEROBIC CAPACITY WHAT EXACTLY ARE THEY TRAINING FOR MEANING WHAT IS THE STRUCTURAL OR SELLER ADAPTATION OR ADAPTATIONS THAT R OCCURRING THAT ALLOW FOR INCREASES AN ANEROBIC CAPACITY AND WHY ARE INCREASES AN ANEROBIC CAPACITY GOOD FOR US EVEN IF WE'RE A QUOTIN QUOT INDURANCE ATHOLEDE OR WE ARE A RECREATIONAL A EXERCISOR WHO IS NOT INTERESTED IN BUILDING MORE MUSCLE SPEED OR THINGS THAT I TYPICALLY ASSOCIATE WITH ANEROBIC CCAPACITY YEA SO THIS IS REALY REALLY FUN REMEMBER ANEROBE CAPACITY IS THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF WORK YOU CAN DO FOR SOMETHING LIKE SECONDS TO A FEW MINUTES THIS IS EXTREMELY HIGH LEVELS OF FATIGUE THE HIGHEST YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO SEE AND BY FATIGUE HERE I MEAN ASCID BUILD UP MY PRODUCTS NOT FATIGUE IS IN LIKE MENSELY ON O ONE DO THIS ANY MORESO IF WE JUST THINK ABOUT THE ENERGETIC FOR SECOND IMAN ADIEU SAY  LET LES TAKE A REALLY EASY EXAMPLE OF PEOPLE HAVE DONE THAT THING WHERE YOU A YOU'LL GO TO THE TRACK AND YOU SPRENT THE STRAIGHTAWAYS AND YOU WALK THE CORNERS  REMBER THAT SORT OF THINK YOU A TOBOTONS THIRTY ON THIRTY OFF THINGS LIKE THIS LIKE THIS IS WHAT WERE TALKING ABOUT IM IN THIS KIND OF ANEROBA CAPACITY ERE NOW HERE'S WHAT GONG TO HAPPEN IS FAT GOING TO BE YOUR LIMITING NOW WE ARE HAVE ALREADY MADE THAT CLEAR RIGHT WHAT ABOUT CARBOHYDRATES WELL IF IT'S A SINGLE BOUT OR A TWO OR THREE BOUTS PROBY NOT BUT IF YOU'RE DOING THIS FOR A LONG TIME SAVEING AND GO THIRTY ON THIRTY OFF FOR TWENTY ROUNDS YOU MAY ACT YOU START REACHING A POINT OF RUNNING ON MIMUST RIVIDEED IT IN ANY THOSE CASES O YOU'RE GOING TO BE RUNNING IN TO AN ACID PROBLEM IF YOU WERE TO CONTINUE TO DO THIS MULTIPER REPETITIONS IN ADDITION TO RUNNING LON MUSCLE LIKE AGEN YOU'RE ALSO MUST TART RUNNING INTO OXYGEN TRANSPORTATION PROBLEMS BECAUSE YOU'RE BUILDING UP A LOT OF BY PRODUCTS YOU GOT IT CONTINUE YOU WILL ACO CRUISE INTO A ROBIC LIKE COLISIS THIS IS EXACTLY WHY THE COMMUNITY THAT I HAVE WORKED A LOT WITH A PROFESSIONAL FIGHTERS VERY HIGHLABLE BOXERS WORLD CHAMPIONS YOU HAVE SEE FIGTERS IT IS A FIVE MINUTE ROUND THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO FIVE TIMES IS FOR RORLD CHAMPING TIFFIGHT TO GET ONE MINUTE BREAKIN BETWEEN SO IMAGINE GOING LIKE THIRTY ON THIRTY OFF FOR FIVE MINUTES GETTING ONE MINUTE BREAK AN DOING THAT FIVE TIMES EVEN KNOW THE INDIVIDUAL BOUTS ARE THIRTY SECONDS LONG THE ENTIRE THING LAST SO LONG IT IS PRIMARILY AROBIC YOU HAVE TO HAVE BOTH CAPACITIES GA GET REALLY HIGH ANROBIC YOU ALSO HAVE TO HAVE A LOT OF AROBIC GOING ON YOU HAW ARE YOU GOING TO START RUNNING IN TO LIMITATIONS BECAUSE OF HART RATE STROKE VOLUME AND THEN EVEN POTENTIALLY VENILATION THE NEED FOR OXGIEN TO BE ABLE TO COME IN IN CLEAR THE CARBONOX I TOLALY OUT OF THE SYSTEM BECOMES A PROBLEM BECAUSE NOT ONLY ARE YOU HAVING SO MUCH BUILD UP FOR SUCH A LONG TIME YOU'RE ALSO USING MOLTIFUL MUSCEL GROUPS SO NOW THIS IS A VERY IMPORTDISTINCTION MUST GO ENDURANCE TENDS TO BE LOCALIZE NAP THIS IS NOT WHY IF YOU'RE DOING AT THESE INTERVALS YOURE HON ASAL BYKE YOUR SPRINTING UP BEHILL IOU'RE GRAPPLING WITH SOMEBODY YOU HAVE A LOT OF MUSCLES BEING VOLV BHITWEENS ALL THAT WAYST IS BEING DUMPED INTO THE CENTRAL PAR YOU HALF TO CLEAR AND I'M BY CLEAR I NOW MEAN NOT OUT OF THE MUSCLE I MEAN OUT OF THE BODY SO YOU'RE ABILITY TO BRING AN UTILAZ OXYGEN IS GOING TO BE A MAJOR LIMITATION YOUREBILY TO HANDLEIST SO WHAT DO YOU DO WELL SPECIFICITY WINDS PRACTISE THE EXACT THING YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SO IF YOU WNT TO GET BETTER AT SPRENDING THE STRAIGHTWAYS AND WALK IN THE CORNERS DO THAT YOU CAN'T ALWAYS DO IT THOUGH WEU'VE GOING TO RUN IN LIMINTATION SO THIS IS WHEN BACKING OFF TO A LOWER INTENSITY IT'S GOING TO GIVE YOU A LOT OF BENEFITS WE KNOW VERY CLEARLY IF YOU WANT TO IMPROVE CARTY OF ASKLEIR FITNESS HIGH INTENSITY MODER INTENSITY ANDLOW INTENSITY OR EFFACTIVE AND YOU ACTUALLY PROBABLY ONE DO A LITTLE BIT OF ALL OF HEM THIS IS WHY NONE OF OUR FIDERS WHATEVER JUST DO HIGH INTENSITY TRAINING THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME MODERATE I'M WE TEND TO CALL THIS LIKE CARDIAC OUTPUT TRAINING IM YOU CAN THINK OF THIS AS LIKE ANYWHERE BETWEEN ZONE TO TO ZONE FOUR IF YOU LIKE ZONES I DON'T USE THEM PERSONALLY 'M JUST GOING TO INTENTIONALLY INTERRUPT YOU BECAUSE THIS ISSUE OF ZONES HAS COME UP A FEW TIMES I WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY'S ON THE SAME PAGE YOU ALSO MENTION THAT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY FAVOR THE ZONE NOMIN CLATURE BUT FOR THOSE NOT FAMILIAR ZONE ONE TO THREE FOUR WY UP TO FIVE IS A OF A BACK TOF THE ENVELOPE A TYPE VERBAGE OU HAVE SOME PEOPLE AND IS MORE PEPRECISELY FOLLOWED BY FOR OTHER PEOPLE MEANING FOR ME A ZONE ONE IS SIMPLY WALKING A EASY WALKING ZONE TOO WOULD BE FOR ANYBODY THE PACE OR INTENSITY OF EXERCISE THAT ONE COULD PERFORM WHILE STILL MAINTAINING A CONVERSATION BUT JUST BARRELY MEANING IF YOU WERE TO PUSH ANY HARDER THEN IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO HOLD THAT CONVERSATION THEN YOU BE IN ZONE THREE AND THEN ZONE THREE FOR FIVE AS I UNDERSTAND THEM ARE LITTLE BIT VAGUE A BUT MAYBE YOU COULD GIVE US A A SENSE OF THE BREATHING PATTERNS ASSOCIATE WITH EACH OF THE ZONES SO THAT PEOPLE COULD A NAP TO THOSE A WHEN WE DISCUSS ZONE ONE THROUGH FIVE A AND AS I SAY ALL THIS I CERTAINLY AM TIP MY HAT TO ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO LIKE TO MEASURE PERCENT AMAXIMUM HART RATE OM THEY LIKE TO USE HEARTRATE MONITORS ON THER USING ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT DEVICES I SOMETIMES USE THOSE DEVICES BUT IN GENERAL I TEND NOT TO AND I USE MY BREATHING AS A ROUGH GUIDE OF WHICH ZONE I AM IN SO BEFORE WE GO BACK TO SPECIFIC PROTOCALS FOR INTEROBIC CAPACITY TELL ME HOW YOU THINK ABOUT ZOWN ONE THROUGH FIVE AND HOW PEOPLE MIGHT BE ABLE TO ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT THEYRE IN IZON ONE TWO THREE OR FOUR WERE FIVE GREAT SO ZON FIVE IS THAT ABSOLUTE TOP THING AND WE CAN FLAG OURSELVES THERE I LIKED HOW YOU FLAGGED ONE IN TO THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THREE FOR AGN FIVE I'M UNLESS CONCERNED WITH EITHER I WE WILL DO SOME HAR RATE STUFF BUT NOT TO IDENTIFY WHAT ZONAREN I'M THE FACT IS THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THOSE ZONES IS BASELY JUST MADE UP RIGT  NOT THAT IT'S FATE BUT IIS NO LIKE RATION ALL THERE IT'S A LOBIT LIKE PERCEIVED EFFORT YOU WAIGT LEFTING THA YOU HO ARE YOU AT A HUNDRED PERCENT OUTPUT OR SEVENY ER SET IT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE AT ZERO AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOUR AT A HUNDRED IN THAT MOMENT BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SIXTY AND SEVENTY IS ANYBODY'S GUESS O SO WE USE OR THE RELEVANTS RIGHT SO WHY IS A MATTER FROM  SIXTY OR SEVENTY IS HERE ACTUALLY IFFERENT THERE'S NOT RIT TIT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER IN THAT REGARD I'M IF YOU ARE VERY HIGHLY TRAINED PARTICUARLY CYCLIST INGS LIKE THAT THEN AND YOU CAN CONTROL LOT OF CIRCUMSTANCES THOSE THINGS START TO MAKE A LOT MORE SENSE IM BUTWHEN YOU'RE AN OPEN ENVIRONMENT LIKE THE ATHLICS I DEAL WITH IT'S IS NOT IN O IT'S NOT IN A MATT EF THAT MUCH SO I'M TH WAY THAT I APPROACH THIS IS ND I WILL USE THIS WORD INTENTUALLY STOLEN DE RECTLY FROM BRYAN MC KENZI AND HIS COMPANY SHIFT ADAPT I'M THEY USE WHAT'S CALLED A GEER SYSTEM AND I ABSOLUTE LOVE IT ITSWET W BE USING FOR A LONG TIME SO WITH BRYING WITH YOUR PERMISSION O ON A TAKE A RIGHT NOW THANK YOU BRINDY GIVE ME THE PERMISSION TO   BRN BRAN'S A GOOD FRIEND OF AOF OURS AND I DO THINK THE BREATHING YOUR SYSTEM IS A TERRIFIC WAY TO THINK ABOUT THE ZONES AND TO GET IN GOOD SENSE OF WHAT ZON ONE HAPPENS TO BE YET GREAT SO I'M THE FIRST GEAR IS YOUR ABILITY TO SIMPLY BREATHE IN AND OUT THROUGH YOUR NOSE AT A SET CATENS SO BASICALLY REGARDLESS OF HOW HARD YOUR WORKING CAN YOU RESTRICT YOUR BREATHING TO LIKE A TWO TO THREE SECOND IND HAL AND THEN I TOO TO THREE SECOND EXHAL AND THIS IS REALLY CLEVOR ACTUALLY BECAUS A LOT OF FOLKS WILL JUMP IMMEDIAELY INTO AN OVERBREATHING STRATITYS MEN TO BE VENILATING MORE THAN YOU NEED WHICH ACTUALLY SENDS THAT AUREARE UP HIGHER THEN I NEES TO BE WHICH KICK YOU HIGHER AND TO CARBORHYDRATE UTIZATION IF YOUARE SUPPOSED TO BE IN COTUNCLE ZON ONE YOU'RE TRYING TO BE EFFICIENT NOT FAST SO USING MORE CARBORHYDRATES THAN YOU NEED IS NOT BENEFICIAL HERE I'M YOU'RE WALKING FOR THE DAY YOU'RE OUT ON A LONGER HIGH C URLY ENJOYING THE YOU SHOULDN'T BE TRYING TO RAMP UP CARBHYDREMTABLAS ND IT SHOULD BE EFFICIENT A AS SO THIS WOULD BE IT GETTING TO AN ARGUMENT WITH SOMEBODY WHILE ON A LONG WALK YOU LL EXHAUSTED AFTERWARDS YOURE NT OVERBREATHING YES HOTALLY RIGHT MC SO YOU SHOULD BEABLE TO BREATHE AT A SPECIFIC ATENS AND GENERALLY PEOPLE ARE A DOING THAT MORE FREQUENTLY THAN TIG THAN THAN Y RI ZON TO RATHER GEAR TOO IS INHALING AND EXHALING AT WHATEVER RATE YOU NEED TO BE BUT STILL NAZAL ONLY SO IT IS A FORCE RIGHT WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO BUT YOUR MOUTH AS CLOSE THE ENTIRE TIME YOUVE SHIFTED HIGHER UP YOU'RE BURNING MORE AND MORE CAR BE HIDRATE AS A FIEL SOURCE I BUT YOU'RE STILL ABLE TO CONTROL THAT AN RESTRICTED I NASAL BREATHING NOW GEAR THREE IND FOR WHICH OS OUR FINAL ONES THERES NO GEAR FIVE GEUR A THREE IN FOR IS LIKE A SUBTLE STRINCTION ACTUALLY DONTYMEN CARE ABOUT THE IFFERENCE THERE I BASELY USED GEAR ONE TOO AND THEN THAT'S FOR BUT YOU'RE BASE COU TALKING ABOUT EITHER A NOSE TO MOUTH STRATEGY OR STRAIGHT UP MOUTHMOUTH Y SO BREATHING IN THROUGH THE NOSE OUT THROUGH THE MOUTH IF YOU CAN CONTROL THAT WAY YOU N KNO THE OPPOSITE ACTUALLY RIGHT CAN YOU BREATHE IN AND OUT THOUG YOUR KNOWS BUT THE CLASSIC ONE PEOPLE DO IS INTO THE NOSE OUT OF THE MOUTH IMAGAIN I REATH NAN CARE ABOUT THIS STINCTION I BASELLY JUMP FROM TO TO FOR A BRYNE MAY DO DIFFERNTLY I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW IM FOR IS JUST MOUTH MOUTH RIGHT AND THIS IS THE CASE IN MOST SPORTING APPLICATIONS YOU'RECAN BE BREATHING BECAUSE THE NOSE IS RESTRICTED RIGHT THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH SPACE AND AS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT HAVING ENOUGH OXYGEN IN OR SEAL TO EXCELLATION IF YOU'RE RESTRICTING THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE PROBLEMATIC SO IN YOUR ACTUAL COMPETITION PLEASE GO TO THE MOUTH IF YOU NEED TO WRIGHT WE PRACTISE A LOT TRYING TO STAY NAZEL ONLY FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE I BUT THAT'S GOING TO HAV VENTUALLY HAPPEN WHEN YOU'RE DOING YOUR HIGH INTENTS AN INTERVALS AND YOU'RE REALLY GOING AS HARD AS YOU CAN YOU'RE GOT A HAVE TO GO YOUR MOUTH UN LES YOURE AN ABSOLUTE FREE CAZOIDE AND OU COAN SAY IN YOUR KNOS BUT THAT'S NOCK CON A HAP AN RIGHT  MOST PEOPLE CAN'T GET PAST SAY SEVENTY OR EIGHTY PERCENT IM WELL BREATHING THOG YOUR KNOS I'M I KNOW SOMETHN WLE GET HIGHER BUT THAT'S THE GENERAL DISTINCTION SO WE PAY MUCH MORE ATTENTION TO THOSE PARTICULAR GEARS THAN WE DO HEART RATES ONS AND ISOWN FIVE WOULD BE JUST PURE MOUTH BREATHING ALL  IT RUN RUN YOURE YOUR LIFE THE GEAR SYSTEMS JUST WONDERFOR THERE'S NO FIFTH GEAR GOT IT SO THE GEAR FOR WOULD AAIN BE MOUTHMOUTH BREATHING AS MUCH IN AS YOU CAN'T BREATHING AS MUCH AS Y CAN NOU GOT IT AND I  APPRECIATE YOUR DESCRIPTION OF OF THE GEAR SYSTEM AND HOW IT AM ROUGHLY RELATES TO THIZONES WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT OL SO AM AM REMINDED IF ANY ONE WANTS TO EXPERIENCE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BREATHING IN THE OFF LOATING OF CARMOND OXIDE AND YOUR ABILITY TO EXERT EFFORT IN ANYTHING A AGAME THAT A FRIEND OF MINE SOMETIMES LIKES TO PLAY WHEN WE WALKER JOG AND TALK AS HE'LL SAY LET'S JUST HOLD OUR BREATH NOW UNUTILL WE HIT THAT PILING OR THAT UM A LIFE GARDSTAND ON THE BEACH AND WITHIN SECONDS YOU ASHY CANSTRUCT A PANIC APS ALSO BECOMES VERY HARD TO CORDINATE YOUR ACTION AFTER A LITTLE WHILE AGAIN BE REALLY CAREFUL WITH THIS BUT BUT IT WE'LL TEACH YOU IN A MOMENT IN A VERY REAL WORLD WAY HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO BE ABLE TO OFF LOAD CARMNDOXID BECAUSE YOURN YE PROBABLY NOT RUNNING OUT OF OXYGEN AT THOSE LOWER INTENSITY IS NO QU YOU'RE SIMPLY BUILDING UP CARBOND OXIDE AND THAT GAS REFLECTSIS SCREAMING TO GO OFF IN YOUR ACTIVELY SUPPRESSING IT YEP SO THE INTERESTING TEST HERE IS YOUR SEAL TO TOLERANCE I'M ON BRHYAN'S WEBSI  GO DIRECTLY THERE YOU CAN THERE'S A BIDYO TO OW TO RUN THIS TEST AND THEN YOU CAN PUT IN YOUR NUMBERS AND IT'LL TELL YOU A SORT OF EXACTLY WHAT TO DO AS RESULT OF IT BUT THE SEEL TO TOLERANCE US IS A TEST OF EXACTLY BUT YOU JUST MENTION SO YOU SHOULD BE FAIRLY TOLERANT AND THERE WAS NON REACTIVE YOU CAN BE RESPONSIVE BUT NON REACTIVE TO ELEVATIONS AND SEAL TO SO YOU SHOULD SEE THEM AN FEEL THEM BUT YOU SHOULD BE CHOOSING HOW YOU RESPOND RATHER THAN AND  REACTION IM THERE ARE INTERESTING DATE OF LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE OUT OF THE BLUE PANIC ATACKS YOU CAN ACTUALLY NOTICE THOSE IN BLOOD THE ARISES AND SEAL TWO UP TO FORTY FIVE MINUTES PRIOR TO TH EVENT A HAPPENING SO THERE ARE SIGNAL'S HAPPENING IN YOUR BODY I'M THAT YOU MAY BE SENSITIVE OR NOT SENSITIVE TO THE MORE INTUNE YOU CAN GET WITH THAT THE BETTER YOUR LIFE IS GOING TO BE IM AND EVEN IF WERE SPECIFICALLY JUST TALKING ABOUT EXERCISE PERFORMANCE SO IT'S OCAY FOR SEAL TO ARISE IT'S GOING TO RISE IT'S A B PRODUCT OF ANEROBIC ANERO METABOLISM IT'S A BY PRODUCT OF CARBOHIDRATE AND FATMATABLAS AS WE'VE ESTABLISHED IT'S GOING TO GET THERE YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL THAT HOWEVER IF YOU IMMEDIATELY GOING TO A PANIC BECAUSE OF A SMALL INCREAS IN SEAL TO THIS IS A PROP SO RETURNING TO ANEROBIC CAPACITY THIS MORNING WE WERE TRAINING NOT TOGETHER I COUDNT KEEP UP WITH YOUR WORK OUT BUT IV BUT IN THE SAME A GENERAL SPACE AND I DID MY ONCE A WEEK MAXIMUM HEART RATE A ONE MINUTE SPRINT ON THE ASSAULT BY SOMETIMES I'LL DO MORE MINUTES A MEANING I WILL DO I ONE MINUTE THAN TAKE SOME RAST INTO ANOTHER MINUTE AFTER SOME REST BUT I DECIDED DO THAT ONE MINUTE WITH YOU THERE SO I COULD LEARN FROM YOU AND INDEED UM I HAVE TO ASSUME THAT THAT WAS LARGELY WITHIN THE ANEROBIC CAPACITY A REALM THE FIRST THIRTY SECONDS OR SO WERE MANAGIBLE WOULD GE MORE AND MORE PAINFUL  THERE WIS A QUIT SIGNAL GOING OFF IN MY HEAD YOU SAID THERE 'S REAL MAGIC THAT OCCURS AROUND SECOND FORTY AND INDEED SOMEWHERE OUND SECOND FORTY FOR WHATEVER REASON IT SEEMED EASIER BUT AT THE ONE MINUTE MARK OU S HAPPYSTOPPIES I WAS REALLY AT AT LEAST WHAT FELT TO ME A ONE HUNDER PERCENT OUTPUT YIS THAT A GOOD PROTOCALL FOR BUILDING UP ANEROBIC CAPACITY KEEPING IN MIND WHAT YOU SAID BEFORE WHICH IS THAT SPECIFICITY AR PRECISION AS YOU RAISED IT AM IS IMPORTANT THAT IS IF I WANT TO TRAIN A INTERUP CAPACITY FOR SPRINTING I PROBABLY SHOULD AVE BEEN SPRINTING LIKLING I WAS I WAS ON LHY ASSAULT BYKE UM AND SO ON HOW MANY OF THOSE ONE MINUTE ALL OUT SPRINS OR THIRTY  I CAN ALL OUT SPRINTS ON T ON THE BYKE COULD IN SHOULD WANE PERFORM PER WORK OUT AND PER WEEK SO MARCHING THROUGH EXERCISE CHOICE YET MUST DO A ORDER VOLUME FREQUENCY AND PRAGRESSION YET CHOICE OF EXERCISES TRAIN FOR WHAT YOU WANT TO IMPROVE IS THAT RIGHT NOT NECESSARY SO IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE IF YOU HAVE A SPECIFICAL YES OF COURSE DO IT I'M EXERCISE CHOICE A COUPLE OF THINGS YOU WANTED LOOK FOR YOU WANT A PICK SOMETHING THAT YOU FEEL EXTREMELY CONFIDENT IN THE MOVEMENT WITH BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO FORGET YOUR BRAIN VERY QUICKLY HERE BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO GOING TO OUR PAIN CAVE GAPE SO IF YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLE RUNNING DON'T GO RUN HERE YOU'RE NEVER OIG TO GET THI SPOT WEN YOU YOU GET TOWITH IIF YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLE OIF EVERY TIME YOU YOU GO ON A ROWER YOUR LOW BACK HIRTS THE NEXT DAY DON'T DO IT IF YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLES USING CATLEBELL SWING IS THAT YOU THE POINT DON'T DO AN EXERCISE YOUR NOT COMFORT WITH YOU ALSO SECONDARILY WANT TO BE CAREFUL CAUTIOUS OF HEAVY ECENTRIC LOATS BECAUSE YOU'RE GING TO BE DOING A LOT OF REPETITIONS ON A HIGH INTENSITY SO THIS IS WHERE I LOVE IN ASSAULT BYAS WHY A ROWER IS GREAT SWIMMING IS AMAZING RUNNING UP HILL GENERALLY MORE FAVORABLE THAN RUNNING ON A NORMAL GROUND ESPECIALLY RE NOT RUNNER DON'T RUN DOWN HI THAT'S THE LOTTY CENTRIC LOAD I DON'T LOVE THINGS LIKE BOX JUMPS HERE RIGHT BECAUSE AGAIN A LOT OF ECENTRIC LOADING IF SUPPOSE YOU CAN JUMP UP LAND IN THE BOXSTEP DOWN BUT NOW YOU'RE YOU'RE AGAIN YOU'RE DO ME THINGSARE GOING YOUR MIND I DON'T WN TA SLIP AND FALL IN MU SMASH MY SHIN IN THE BOX WHAT HAPPENS IF I M DO MANY VERIBLS PICK SOMETHING THAT IS SAFER WHERE YOU CAN REALLY FOLCAS ON YOUR BREATHING IN YOUR POSTURE AND THE PERFORMANCE IHT SO THAT'S EXERCISE CHOICE AND AND WITHIN THAT IF THERE'SE SOME SPECIFIC THING YOU WANT O GET BETTER AT GO AHEAD DO IT OGE HOW MANY DIFFERENT MOVEMENTS MEANING SHOULD I DO THE ASSAULT BY AND THEN ON SOME FORM OF SAFE EXECUTABLE OVERHEAD PRESSIN UM IS SO HARD IT'S LTTLE HARDER TO IMAGINE AM IN EROB CAPACITY FOR THE UPPER BODY UNLESS YOU HAVE ACCESS TO A SKEER OR ONE OF THESE AM WHAT ATHE THINGS CALL THE CLIMBERND MACHINES SEE AT THE VIRST CLIMBER A VERSER CLIMBER THAT'S THE ONE OF THE RUSI CLIMBER UM YOU TELL HOW OFTEN I DO THAT ONE A AH 'S A GREATSO GREAT PIECE OF EXCI SCUIME YOUS SOR WETHING HOW MANY HOW MANY HOW MANY EXERCISES AND IN WHAT ORDER IS IT GOING TO BE TWO OR THREE EXERCISE SINCE YOU'RE INVOLVING A LOT OF MUSSLE GROUPS TO M  THAT'S OU REALLY DISTINCTION GENERALLY THESE ARE GOING TO BE TOTAL BODYMOVEMENTS SO YOU CAN DO SOMETHING LIKE A SKEERG IF YOU WANT A REALLY ISOLATE YOUR UPPER BODY GREAT LOVE THAT YOU CAN DO LOWER BODY ISOLATION LIKE CYCLING MIGHT RAPROVISE NI INVALL YOU CAN USE WAITS HERE YOU CAN DO SOME BARBELL MOVEMENTS AND AND SELF LIKE THAT THERE IS NOT MY FAVORITE CHOICES FOR MOST PEOPLE TO ANY COMPLEX CITY THINGS GOING ON SO AH I GENERALLY'M GOING TO PICK TOTAL BODY MOVEMENTS A PUSHING A SLED DRAGGING A SLED SPRENTING UP HILL SWAMMING THESE THINGS LIKE THAT ARGON O BE GOOD I'M SEEN NOW WHY THE ASSAULT BY AN SUCH A POWERFUL TOOL BECAUSE YOU'RE USING YOUR ARMS WITH SOME DEGREE OF RESISTANCE BUT NOT A LOT OF ECENTRIC LOWED PLUSS LEGS SOME RESISTANCE NOT A LOT OF ECENTRIC LOWED AND YET ONE CAN GO CUONICLE ALL OUT FOR THIRTY SIXTY SECONDS YET AND T IN THE CONSEQUENCES OF A TECHNICAL BREAK DOWN ARE MENAMAL YOU'RE IS MORE LIKE YOU'R CAN ACTITO HAVE A WORSE PERFORMANCE RATHER THAN AN INJURY RAT SO THAT THERE IS JUST A WONDERFUL INVENTION A BEBECAUSE OF THAT WHERE OTHER THINGS THE CON SEQUENCES LIKE SAY IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE DOING A BARBELL OR CATABELL ACTIVITY THE CONSEQUENCES OF MAKING A TACKLIN MISTAKE YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY GET IN ACUTE INJURY RIGHT THERE SO THEY'RE JUST A LITO BIT HIGHER IN THE RISTS SCAL HOW MANY SETS OR SOMETIMES REFER TO HIS REPEATS YET SO HOW MANY THIRTY TO SIXTY SECOND ALL OUT SPRINTS AGAIN DOESN'T HAVE TO BE RUNNING SPRINTING BUT ALL OUT EFFORT WOU BE THE BETTER WAY TO PHRASE IT SHOULD I PERFORM LET'S SAY PER WEEK YAND THEN DECIDE WHETHER NOT WE CAN DIVIDE THOSE UP ACROSS MULTIBLE WORK OUTS OR WHETHER NOT'S BETTER TO DO THEM H THE SAME WORK O YET IF YOU'RE STAYING WITH THE SAME EXERCISE FOR ALL OF YOUR WORKOUTS SLOW O BIT DIFFEREN ANSWER THAN IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE MODIFYING THEM SO SAY YOU GIN TO DO THIS THREE TIMES A WEEK AND YOU DO AN ARBICE ONE DAY YOU N DO SOME HILL SPRINTS ANOTHER DAY AND YOU CAN DO SOME SWIMMING ANOTHER DAY FOR  THEY  OF EXAMPLE I'M GOING TO SAY UM SAME MOVEMENT BECAUSE I THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE MOST COMFORTABLE WITH ONE OR TWO TYPES OF MOVEMENTS UNLESS TEY ARE REALLY CORDINATED OR AN EXCELLENT ATLY I THINK MOST PEOPLE CAN PROBABLY FIND A HILL THAT THEY COULD RUN UP AND A AN AERDINEOR ASSAULT BYK A ROWER THINGS O THAT SORT YET YOU'RE GUN A HAVE A PRO AN ACON HERE SO THE PRO OF DOING LESS SETS IF YOU CAN ACTUALLY TRAIN MUCH CLOSER TO TRULY ONE HUNDRED PER CENT THE DOWNSIDE IS VOLUMES LOW SO A MAJOR MISTAKE PEOPLE MAKE HERE IS THEY'LL DO SOMETHING LIKE IM I'LL DO TWENTY SECONDS ON TEN SECONDS OFF HOW'LL DO THAT FOR FORTY ROUNDS YOU'RE NOT REALLY ACTUALLY GOING THAT HARD OS TWENTY SECOND SO A KEY IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT THE LITERATURE IN ALL THE BOZ AND ALL THE POSITIVE BENEFITS OF HIGH INTENTS IN YOURL TRAINING THAT ASSUMES YOU ARE ACTUALLY HITTING VERY CLOSE TO ONE HUNDRED PER CENT IF YOU'RE SLIDING DOWN AND LIKE AGAIN MODERATE TRAINING STUFF YOUE START TO ACTUALLU BEING A SPOT WHERE YOU'RE NOT GETTING THE TOTAL HIH IN STUFF BU YOU'RENOT DOING IT LONG ENOUGH TO GET THE LOW IN STUFF EITHER AND SEING UP IN THIS LIKE YOU BURN SOME CALORIES YOU PROBABLY STILL ENHANDED MINAL CONDRABOUT DENTIS IS OME LITTL ABOUT A COPILIZATION BUT YOU DIDN'T REALLY JUSTIFY ONLY DOING THREE ROUNDS THAT'S WERE THE PROBLEM COMES IN SO IN TERMS OF A COUPLE OF PROTOCALLS I'LL GIVE YOU HOW MANY SETS PER WEEK IT'S IT'S REALLY HARD TO GIVE A NUMBER UNLIKE THE STRANGTH TRAIN STUFF WERE IT WAS EASY TO CONLANCE SHIMSELF ON IMA TYPICAL THING YOU'LL SEE IS LIKE A MINIMUMBILF TENDS TO BE SOMETHING LIKE FOUR ROUNDS PER DAY THREE TIMES PER WEEK THAT'S A LOT SO MY ONCE A WEEK ALL OUT EFFORT OF SPRINTING ON THE ASSAULT BY THE SO CALLED ERDINE BYKE FOR SIXTY SECONDS ONE TO THREE ROUNDS OF THAT MIGHT BE DOING SOMETHING USEFUL FOR ME BUT I SHOULD PROBABLY BE DOING THAT TWO OR THREE TIMES A WEEK IF YOU'RE GON TO GET TO A MAX HART RIGHT ID GENERAL LIKE TO SAY GIVE ME A MINIMUM OF ONE DAY A WEEK TOSE BETTER DAYS PER WEEK HOW MANY ROUNDS WHATEVER IT TAKES YOU TO GET TO THAT MAXIM HARRIHT I SO IN YOUR CASE YOU DID ONE MINUTE O GET GOOD IF YOU'RE GOING TO EXTEND PAST A MINUTE OR TWO ONE ROUND MIGHT BE ENOUHSO FOR EXAMPLE I IF YOU WANT TO DISE DU SOMETHING WHERE I'M GOING A RUN A MILE AS FAST AS IT CAN THAT'S ALL YOU NEED TO DO FOR THE DAY YOU DON'T NEED TO DO MULTIPLE YOU CAN DO MILE RE PECES IF YOU'D LIKE BUT THAT IS REALLY REALLY CHALLENGING I KNOW WE'VE EXTENDED THE TIME DRATION HERE BUT I WANT TO GO THERE TO SHOW YOU THE TIME DO ME MATTERS YOU IF YOU DOING SOMETHING LIKE A TWENTY SECOND BURST YOU'RE GOING TO NEED MORE ROUNDS IF YOU DOING SOMETHING LONGER LIKE MULTIPLE MINUTES YOU DON'T NEED AS MANY ROUNDS TO GET THERE SO IM IN ADDITION IF YOU'RE REALLY REACHING AST THIS I NINETY SECONDS OF OF HELL WEN DO IT'S JUST GOING TO DO A LOT MORE DAMAGE THIS IS 'M NOT DAMAGING THAN BAD BUT I'S IN LIKES A LAT TO RECOVER HERE SO WE NEED MORE RECOVERY TIME FROM THAW A TWENTY SECOND BURST DOESN'T REALLY CHALLENGE YOU CHALLENGE YOU IN THAT TWENTY SECOND SHU BUT YOUOULD BE RECOVERED AND FINE A THREE MINUTE THING E'S GOING A HURT NIT'S CAN A HURT FOR MANY MANY MANY MINUTES AFTER THAT AND YU'RE GOING TO STILL SEE MAY BE SOME PERFORM A SECONDMENTS THEN NEXT DAY DEPENDING ON WHAT YOUR RECOVERY STUFF LOOKS LIKE SO I'M A COUPLE OF THINGS TO PAY PLAY WITH A BE SOMETHING LIKE THIS IF YOU WANT TO TRY LIKE A CLASSIC THIRTY SECONDS ON THIRTY SECONDS OFF PROTOCAL THE LITERATUR ILL SHOW LIKE A MINIMUM OF FOUR ROUNDS OF THAT PROBABLY THREE DAYS A WEEK SO THIRTY SECOND IT'S ALL OUT THIRTY SECONDS REST IS ONE ROUND REPEAT THAT FOUR TIMES AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK AT LEAST TWO WOULD BE BETTER GRIGHT RIGHT IF YOU WANT TO GO SOMETHING A LOT LONGER N THAT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH ONE IM BUT GENERALLY TWO DAYS WEEK OF THIS IS BETTER IF YOU START ACTUALLY PUSHING PASS LIKE THREE TO FOUR DAYS A WEEK UPTO FIVE OR SIX YOU MAY ACTUAL BE CAUSING SOME PROBLEMS  THERE'S IS JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EXCESS FATIGUE THIS CANNOT HAPPEN THERE THAT YOUYOUE MAY YEU MUST STAY AWAY FROM IN FACT U YOU CAN SE A LOT OF ANDERICAN LOGICAL PROBLEMS AND SOME OTHER SLEEP ISSUES ON SOME OTHER THINGS TICKIN IAND WE'LL TALK ABOUT MORE OF THOSE THINGS AS LATER BUT I'M THAT'S A NUMBER TO GET WITH IF YOU WNT TO TRY SOMETHING MORE LIKE A TWENTY SECOND BIRST I ACT YOU WOULD RECOM MEND GIVING YOURSELF MORE REST SO UYOU CAN ACTUALLY DO A HIGHER REST THEN WORK RATIO MOST PEOPLE TEND TO THING OF THIS IS DOING LIKE ONE TO ONE TWENTY SECONDS ON TWENTY SECONDS OFF OR LOWER I LOVE DOING LIKE TWENTY SECONDS ON FORTY SECONDS OFF THE QUALITY OF THAT TWENTY SECONDS BECOMES EXTRAORDINARILY HIGE AND IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE TO NOW GET LIKE SIX TO EIGHT ROUNDS SOS I'M HEARING THIS I'M GOING TO WAGER A  AN OFFER I TO YOU AND IF YOU SAY O K IM THEN TO TO THOSE LISTENING THIS SON'E WHAT YOU'RE TOLLING ME ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INTENSITY AND QUALITY AND THE NEED FOR SUFFICIENT DURATION OF THIS ANEROBIC WORK HOW IS FIVE TO SIX MINUTES PER WEEK OF ALL OUT WORK THAT S PRETTY GOOD SO WHAT THAT MEANS FOR ME IS I WOULD DO THREE ALL OUT ONE MINUTE SPRINTE ON ONE WORK OUT SEPARATED BY A MINUTE OR TWO MAYBE MORE AND I WOULD DO THAT TWO OR THREE TIMES PER WEEK JUST TRYING TO HIT THAT FIVE OR SIX MINUTE PER WEEK THRESHOLD YET ACTUALLY THINK I ONE OF THE A MARTI GABALLA IS THE SCIENTIST A  CANADIAN AGI AMAZING WORK YHO'S DONE A LOT OF THE THE RESEARCH ON HIGH INTENSIANAL STOP RAG AD I THINK THE NUMBER HE ACTUALLY THROUGHOUT THERE SOME OF HITS ORIGINAL RESEURCH WAS COMPARING SIX TOTAL MINUTES OF WORK TO UPWARDS OF LIKE A HUNDRED EIGHTY MINUTES OF WORK THROUGHOUT UM THE ENTIRE WEEK AND I AN ONE OF THE CLASSIC STUDIES WAS LOOKING AT VEAL TO MAX IMPROVEMENTS AND HE SAW EQUAL IF NOT GREATER IMPROVEMENTS OF YEAL TO MAXTS WITH THAT SO I THINK ACTUALLY NAME OF HIS BOOK MIGHT BE LIKE THIS SIX MINUTE WORK OUT OR SOMETHING AND SO YOU LIKE MAY AVE NAILE THAT DIRECTLY ON THE HEAD A PURELY BY LOCK BUT ACTUALLY BY ALSO MAY BE RON A NOVER S WE HUR ROPY FACTTO THAT YE WELL AND ALSO BY INFERENCE FROM WHAT YOU WARE SAYING Y ENOUGH YOU GANG TO DO THIS TWENTY SECONDS ON FORNTY SECONDS OFF AD YOU DRING MORE ROUNDS OR ONE MINUTE ALL OUT ITS THE WAY I'M GOING TO THINK ABOUT THIS IF IT'S TOK CAYE WITH YOU IS FOR FIVE TO SIX MINUTES A WEEK I AM SPRINTING FOR MY LIFE CORRECT BUT I'M SPRINTING FOR MY LIFE WITH GOOD FORM IN WHATEVER MOVEMENT I HAPPEN TO BE DOING AND I CAN DO ALL OF THAT IN ONE WORK OUT BUT I'M SEPARATING OUT BOUTS OF TWENTY SECONDS ALL THE WAY UP TO ONE MINUTE YE BY THE NECESSARY RAST IN ORDER TO RECOVER MY BREATHING GET BACK TO PURE NAAL BREATHING MAY BE KNOWN ONE'S OWN TEARLY TOTALLY AND THEN HEADED AGAIN IF YOU CAN DO T ONE MINUTE THING LIKE YOU DO I ACTUALLY GENERALLY ENCOURAGE ONE TO THREE MINUTES OF REST BEFORE YOU DO THE NEXT ROUND AND PROBABLY UP THE FOUR TO SIX ROUNDS THAT WOULD BE YOUR SIX MEN AT NUMBER THERE NOW THE CAVY OUT THERE IS WE DON'T WORRY ABOUT HARTRAHT RECOVERY WE WORRY ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT YOU MENTIONED WHICH IS NAZAL ONLY RECOVERY ONCE YOU CAN GET BACK TO THAT IF YOURSELF ANOTHER THIRTY SECONDS OR SO AND HE YOU'RE READY TO GO FOR ROUND TO IS WHERE GETS FUN BECAUSE I CAN IMAGINE CHALLENGING MYSELF TO GET ON THE ASSAULT BY FOR ONE MINUTE OF KIND OF WORM UP VERY LOW INTENSITY EACH MORNING AND THEN SPRINT FOR A MINUTE AND THEN HEAD OFFIN TO MY DAILY ROUTINE NO OK THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT THOUGH YOU NED TO GIVE ME THREE MINUTES A NAZEL ONLY BREATHING BEFORE YOU GO BACK TO WORK WE NEED TO DOWNCERLY TO THAT AND THEREARE PEOPLE IN MY LIFE THAT WOULD LOVE FOR ME TO ENGAGE IN MORE NAZAL BREATHINGS AS WILL HAVE ME SPEAKING LESS  I NO PROBLE CHANCES ARE I'M GOING TO USE THE UM TWO OR THREE WORK OUTS PER WEEK OF ONE MINUTE ALL OUT MAY BE'LL TRY THE SHORTER NEVOR TO CALL CAN I GEIVE YOU ONE FON PROTCALED A TRYER PLEASE SO IF YOU HAVE A EVEN USES ON ANY EQUIPMENT UM BUT I LEARNED THIS FROM HIM ANOTHER MUTUAL FRIEND CANNY CAN THIS IS A GREAT LITTLE IT'S A LITTLE TEST LITTLE A LITTLE GAME YOU CAN PLAY WITH YOURSELF AND THER ONLY WAY TO PLAY THIS GAME IS YOU'RE OING TO LOSE WHICH IS REALLY REALLY LOVELY SO YOU CAN DO THIS IN ANY DURAT D YOU CAN DO THIS FOR ANY DURATION OF TIME BUT TWO MINUTES IS A GOOD NUMBER CASE SO YOUE HAVE TO DO THIS INS TOME WHRE YOU CAN NO DISTANCE SO THIS CAN BE RUNNING I'M CYCLYING THE THE ARE BYKE IS WHAT I US THE FIRST TWO MINUTES YOU'RE GOING TO COVER AS MUCH DISTANCE AS YOU CAN POSSIBLY COVER IN TWO MINUTES AND YOU'RE GOING TO NOTE THAT SO LET'S SAY YOU COVERED FOUR HUNDRED METERS O CATE GREAT YOU'RE GOING TWO REST FOR TWO MINUTES AMAZING THAT NEXT ROUND YOU'RE NOW GOING TO GO FOR DISTANCS SO YOU'RE GOING TO COVER THE EXACT SAME WON A DISTANCE YOU COVERED IN ROUND ONE WHICH IN THIS EXAMPLE AS FOUR HUNDRED METERS AND IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW LONG IT TAKES YOU IT MAY TAKE YOU TWO MINUTES IN FIVE SECONDS TWO MINUTES IN TEN SECONDS CAUSE YOU'RE LITTLE BIT FATIGUE FROM ROUND ONE ROUND THREE YOUARN CANNOW COME BACK AND DO THAT EXACT SAME TIME DO MAIN THAT YOU DID AROUND TO SO IF IT TOOK YOU TWO MINUTES IN FIVE SECONDS AND ROUND TWO NOW ROUND THREE IS GOING THE LAST TWO MINUTES AND FIVE SECONDS AND YOU WANT TO SEE IF YOU CAN COVER A GREATER DISTANCE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIVE METERS FOR HUNDRED TEN METERS THEN YOU DID ANROUND ONE AND THE BEAUTY OF THIS LITTLE PROTOCOL SIX MINUTES TOTAL OF WORK RIGHT BUT IF YOU SLACK IN ONE OF THE ROUNDS YOU JUST MAKE THE NEXT ROUND HARDER IS THERE ANY REST BETWEEN ROUNDS YET TWO MINUTES ALWAYS TWO MINUTES REST YOU NOT HAVE TO BUT THIS S WUD BE MY RECOMMENDATION CAN HY CANE CAME UP WITH US I I DON'T KNOW IF HE CAME OUP WITH IT HE TOT ME WELL THANK WE BOTH NO CANY AN HE'S AN INCREDIBLY NICE AND INCREDIBLY SKILLED TRAINER IM I MNT CALL IT THE SUGAR CANE YEO GREAT BECAUSE IT SOUNDS REALLY PAINFUL AND IF YO GO BOUT TOO HARD ROUND ONE YOU'RE IN SUCH BIG TROUBLE ROUND TO BUT IF YOU GO TOO EASY ROUND ONE YOU'RE GOING TO GET ABSOLYT OBLITERATED AND ROUND THREE SO IT'S IT TAKE A WONDERFUL THING AND YOU CAN PICK THAT NUMBER AS A SANDISATION AN THEN IS TRY TO IMPROVE THAT A LITTLE BIT PER WEEK SO PROGRESSION IS THE LAST PART OF THIS WHOLE THING THAT WE HAVEN'T GOT TO YET BEFORE YO MOVE ON I'M AND IN THE WAY YOU WANT TO PROGRESS ALL OF THESE THINGS IS YOU CAN TIME STAMP AGAIN HOW MUCH WORK YOU CAN DO AND THEN IS TRY TO DO A SLIGHTLY HIRE AMOUNT OF WORK FIVE PER CENT OR SO EVERY WEEK OR YOU CAN ADD A ROUND WHICH IS REALLY NICE WAY SO I'M E IN THE IN THE RESEARCH I'M STUDYIES THAT O BEN DONE THERE CAN TO DO THINGS LIKE WEEK ONE YOU'LL DO THREE ROUNDS WE TWO YOU'LL DO FOUR ROUNDS REE THREE YOUL GO FIVE ROUNDS SEO LIKE AT A ROUND ANTIL YOU GET UP TO SAY SIX OR SEVEN OR EIGHT ROUNDS AT THE END OF THE PROTOCOL SO THAT'S A REALLY NICE WAY TO GO ABOUT IT OR YOU CAN CAP THE ROUNDS AND JUST TRY TO GET MORE WORK DONE IN THAT SAME AMOUT A TIME MEANIN GOING MORE INTENSELY CORRECT GET YOND GET FURTHER DISTANCE IN YOUR THIRTY SECONDS OR YOU'R FORTY FIVE SECONDS OR WHATEVER I'M IR WANTIN COURAGE PEOPLE TOU GO AS LOW AS TWENTY SECONDS THAT'S GOING ALIVEYU TO GO VERY VERY VERY FAST THAT'S GOING TO ACTUALLY CHALLENGE THAT PHOSPHICRETIONG PIECE A LITTLE BIT I' WANT ON COURAGE PEOPLE ALSO GO AS HIGH AS NINETY SECONDS SO THE HONEST WAY THE WAY THAT I WILL DO IT NOT THAT IT'S ABOUT ME BUT JUST AS AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING YOU COULD DO I DO SOMETHING IN THE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY SECOND BURST RANGE AND I WILL GENERALLY HEDGS TOWARDS A TWO TO ONE REST TO WORK RATIO SAW IM PROBEGAIN A REST FORTY TO SIXTY SECONDS THAT'S YURE TO THAT'S TO MAKE SURE THAT TWENTY SECOND BURST IS EXTREMELY HIGH QUALITY CO I'M ALSO GONG TO DO SOMETHING IN THE THIRDY TO FIFTY SECOND RANGE GAPE I MIGHT GO ONE TO ONE WORK RESTRATIO THE QUALITY OF THOSE THIRTY SECONDS IS GINGTO COME DOWN BUT THE ACID BUFFERING IS GOING TO BE EXTRAORDINARILY CHALLENGE I'L ALSO WILL DO THAT WITH A TRIPLE OR QUADROOPLE REST RANGE SO AGAIN THIRTY SECONDS ON MAYBE TWO MINUTES OFF NOW I WON'T BE ABLE TO I WON'T BE WORKING ON MY ABILITY TO HANDLE IM THE WASTE PRODUCT BILD UP THERE BUT I'LL BE WORKING ON MY ABILITY TO PRODUCE MORE FORCE OVER THAT TIME WHICH IS ANOTHER SCIL SAID AND THEN ALL THE WAY UP TO SAY WHAT YOU DO A MINUTE SEVENTY SECONDS AND YOU CAN GO ONE TO ONE THERE OR UP TO THREE TO ONE I'M YOU EAN BE WORKING A LITE BIT OF IS DIFFERENTHING BUT THAT'S EXACTLY HOW WE HIT BOTH SIZES OF THIS EQUATION WORKING ON DEALING WITH WASTE AS WELL AS ACTUALLY WORKING ON BRINGING IN NEUTRIANS AND GETTING THAT SYSTEM ALO OF IT MORE AFFECTIF SO I'M YOU CALD SET THAT UP ACROSS YOUR WEEK AND JUST IT CAN BE SOMETHING LIKE DAY ONE IS THAT TWENTY SECOND BURST WINDOW DAY TWO IS THAT MAYBE SIXTY SECOND WINDOW AND TEN DAY THREE IS MAY BE ONE ALL OUT EFFORT AND WE'RE DONE THERE LET'S TALK ABOUT THE SPECIFIC PROTOCALLS AND ADAPTATIONS RELATED TO MAXIMUM EROBIC OUTPUT OR MAXIMUM MOROBIC CAPACITY IS AT SOMETIMES CALLED SORE NOW E'REMOVING PAST LIKE THAT COUPLE OF MENUTE RANGE IN TO LIKE THE AN FIVE TO FIFTEEN MEN A RANGE BUT AT A MAXIMUM INTENSITY SO IT'S THE HIGES YOU CAN GO FROM THERE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT TOUR LAST CATEGORY OF LONG DURATION HERE WELL THE BEAUTIFUL PART IS WE'VE WORTY EXPLAIN THE LOT OF IT CAUSE IT'S VERY SIMILAR TOAT WE JUST TALKED ABOUT WITH ANTEROPCAPACITY A IT IS PRIMARILY GOING TO BE A PROBLEM OF DEALING WITH WASTE PRODUCTS ESPECIALLY AT THE END IT'S NOT ENOUGH TOTAL DISTANCE TO BE RUNNING OUT OF MUSCLE LIKEA IN THOUGH IT MAY START TO CREEP DOWN A LITTLE BIT FATS NOT CAN BE IN ISSUE BUT CERTAINLY MORE OXYGEN TRANSPORTATION IS CANBE IN ISSUE SO WE'RE JUST HEDGING A LITTLE BIT MORE TOWARDS THAT SIDE OF THE EQUATION TOWARDS THE END OF THAT WORK OUT NO DOUBT ABOUT IT CLEARING OUT WASTE PRODUCTS HIS GOING TO BE A HUGE ISSUE BUT REALLY OXYGEN DEMAND DELIVERY STARTING TO TAKE MORE OF A PROMINENT ROLE BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD MORE TIME TO CLEART WASTE AND IF WE'RE NOT GOOD AT THAT WERE TO BE FAILING EARLIER THAN WE NEED SO THE TRAIN FOR THAT NEEDS TO BE A LITTLE BIT AT THAT EXACTING SO A CLASS IC THING HERE IS A ONE MILE THAT'S RIGHT THIS S GON A LAST FOR MOST PEOPLE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FIVE AND TEN MINUTES YOU'RE SORT OF RIGHT IN THIS WINDOW I IF YOU JUST WANT TA PRACTICE THAT ONCE A WEEK WE'RE DONE HERE RIGHT EXERCISE CHOICE SAME THING WE TALKED ABOUT RIGHT PICK AND EXERCISE YOUR COMFORTABLE WITH THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO AND YOU CAN PROGRESSIVELY INCREASE IN TERMS OF THE INTENSITY I'M YOU NOT CAN BO YOU' HAVE TO STOP AND CHANGE YOUR EXERCISE AND I CAN AVMENVE ROUND LIKE A CIRCUIT ISN'T GRAT HERE BECAUSE YOU GOT A PUT ONE IMPLEMENT DOWN PICK UP ANOTHER ONE YOU WAGHT TO BE DOING SOMETHING WHERE THERE IS LITTLEI NOT A SECOND OF OFFSWITCH SO SIMILAR EXERCISE CHOICE PRINCIPLES WE JUST COVERED IF YOU GON BECOME A REAL SAVAGE AND YOU WANTO DO REPEATS HERE YOU CAN IM IN DURANCE FOLKS WILL DO THAT A LOT ONE WHILE REPEATS EIGHT HUNDRED MI YOUR REPEATS THINGS LIKE THAT OR I'M NOT SURE WITH THE SWIMMING THISANCE EQUIVALENCE WOULD BE BUT SWIMMERS WE DO THIS CONSTALLY BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO THIS IS REALLY HARD ITS PRETTY HARD IN THE SYSTEM IT'S VERY GOOD FOR YOU ONE TO TWICE A WEEK OF HITTING THIS I THINK YOU BEIN A REALLY REALLY GOOD SPOT I'M FREQUENCY WE SORT OF DISCOVERED WE COVERED EXERCISE CHOICE VOLUME YE DISTORTED NAILED AND INTENSITY IS PASICALLY RUNNING YOU UP TO THE TOP THERE NOW BECAUSE YOU CAN ONLY DO THAT SO OFTEN YOU WANT O AT IN ANOTHER FORTY OR SO PER CENT OF YOUR TIME BEING LOWER INTENSITY SUPPORT WORK FOR THAT SO THIS IS SOMETHING PROBABLY LESS TAN EIHTY FIVE PERCENT OF YOUR HEART RAGE BUT HIGHER THAN QUOTNCOTIZOWN TO YOUEGOT TO BE WORKING HERE THIS IS NOT I COULD HAVE A CONVERSATION PACE THIS IS HIGHER THAN THAT IT'S IN BETWEEN CONVERSATION PACE AND THE PACE I NEED TO BE AT TO RUN MY FASTEST MILE OF EVER DONE THAT'S THAT MIDDLE GROUND AND YOU NEED TO TRAIN THAT SO THATYOU CAN CONTINUE TO WORK I CAPITAIZATIO AND OCTIN TRANSPORTATION BUT YOU'RE NOT BURNING DOWN THE HOUSE GETTING ALL WE UP TO HUNDRED HUNDRED PLUSTERSCENT OF YOUR VEAL TO MAX COULD I USE A A A CRUDE VERSION OF THIS WERE I SAY OK I'M GOING TO EXERCISE FOR TEN MINUTES IME GO AS FAST AS I SAFELY CAN AND EVERY WEEK I'M GOING TO MEASURE HOW FAR I TRAVEL YET EAS THAT TEN MINUTES LOVE IT PROBABLY NOT ON THE SAME DAY THAT I'M DOING THE INTEROBY CAPACITY WORK PROBABLY NOT IF YOURE RODABLY OCADE TO DOU AFTER A STRENGTH TRAINING OR HYPORTOVY WORK OUT AS LONG AS IT DIN TRAIN LEGS YOU COULD UM IT'S PROBABLY AN A COMPROMISED RECOVER IS THE WAY SO I WOULD IF YOU'REGOIN TO DO A SESSION LIKE THIS I WOULD PROBABLY DO IT ON ITS OWN DAY INLESS YOU WANTED TO DO SOMETHING LIKE SPEED OR POWER THEN YOU COULD ROLL RIGHT TO THIS AND HAVE NO PROBLEM MAYBE A STRENGTH TA A HYPRITURY DAY I'M NOT SURE I YOU DO THERE BECAUSE A AGAN ESPECIALL BE DID ANY SORT OF LORD BY T EXERCISE YOUECAN BE COMPROMISED HERE BUT REMEMBER THESE TEN TO BE FULL BODY MOVEMENTS SO EVEN IF YOU DID ARMS THAT DAY YOUR ARMS AN BE IS AND YOU DON'T WANT A FAIL THIS BECAUSE OF LOCAL MUSCULAR FAILURE IH'D'S A NOWV GON MY WORK CUT OUT FOR ME I ME TO BE DOING FIVE TO SIX MINUTES R WEEK OF ALL OUT WORK DIVIDED INTO SIXTY TWENTY SIXTY SECOND BOUTS WITH SUFFICIENT REST AND I'M GOING TO GIVE MYSELF TEN MINUTES A WEEK OF IN MY CASE YOU'LL PROBABLY BE RUNNING AS FAST AS I CAN A I DO ENJOY RUNNING AND I CAN DO IT SAFELY UM MHAYBE UP HILL AND SEE HOW FAR I GO YET IF YOU WANT TO COMBINE THE TO SOV YO SAING HEY I'M BOUGHT IN ANDY LIKE I WANT TO DO BOTH OF THESE SAMES THEY ARE SIMILAR BUT THEY HAVE INDEPENDENT BENEFITS I'M CONVINCED HOW WOULD I BUILD THESE IN THE SAME WEEK I'M MAYBE DO ONE OF EACH THAT STILL GETS YOU AT QOTUNCLE TWO DAYS PER WEEK WERE YERE GIT TI HAN A HOT MAXIM HAR RIGHT SO WE ARE TO CHECK THAT BOX OP SO ONE DAY CAN BE A SHORTER LENGTH INTERVALL REPEAT ONE AN THE OTHER ONE CAN SIMPLY BE A FIVE TO FIFTEEN MINUTE MAXIMUM WORK AND YOU'RE DONE LONG DURATION INDURANCE EXERCISE THE STERIO TYPICAL INDURANCE EXERCISE SUR HOW FAR HOW LONG HOW FASTER HOW SLOW SHOULD O RATHER A SHOULD I GO AND HERE I'M CAN VENTURE THAT EXERCISE CHOICE IS ONE THAT WE COULD CLICK OFF EVEN AT THIS POINT IN THE DISCUSSION BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IT'SCOT TO BE SOMETHING THAT I CAN DO FOR A LONG WHILE WITHOUT GETTING INJURED OVER YOUE INJURIES UM THERE'S A LITTLE BIT A NOTELL DO WE COACTULOU THROWN HERE SO ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVE TO DO FOR LONG DURATION ENDURANCE FOR PEOPLE DON'T LOVE RUNNING SYCLING AR SWEMMING AS YOU CAN DO THE REALLY COOL WORK OUT ANY NUMBER OF THINGS WHERE YOU CAN PUT A LITTLE CIRCUIT TOGETHER AS LONG AS THERE'S NOT A LOT OF DOWN TIME BETWEEN ONE CIRCUIT OF THE NEXT TIME YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO AS SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS LIKE MAYBE YOU'RE GOING TO DO FARMERS CARRIES AND YOU'LL DO THAT FOR SAY THREE MINUTES AND YOU'LL SET THOSE DOWN YOU YOU'LL GO STRAIGHT IN TO A PLANK FOR A MINUTE AND YOU'LL PICK THAT UP ANDYOU GO STRAIGHT IN TO MAY BE BODY WEIGHT SQUATS FOR TWO MINUTESTHAND YOU GO STRAIGHT IN TO ANOTHER EXERCISE AND YOU SUIT YOU CAN SORT OF ROA TAKE THINGS AROUND  MAYBE YOU CAN DO EVEN SOME LIKE SHADOW BOXING STOP OR SOME JUMP RO YOU CAN DO DIFFERENT GIM NASTICS MOVEMENTS AND BODY WEIGHT MOVEMENTS AND YOU CAN RUN THAT THING THROUGH AND YOU CAN BASE CU GET THE EXACT SAME THING ACCOMPLISHED AND NOT FEEL LIKE YOUR DOING O MY GOSH THIS MINE NUMBING TYPE OF TRAINING IF IT FEELS LIKE THAT TO YOU IANOTHER WA CAN DO THAT AFTER YOUVEN SIMPLIFYD EVEN MORE  WE'VE DONE THIS THAT CANY CANS JIM PLENTY OF TIMES WHERE YOU JIST MAYBEVEN PICK THREE MACHINES SA CIN NG O'M I AGO TEN MINUTES ON THE ROWER AND IM GO TEN MINUTES ON THE TREAD MELL ON I'M GO TEN MINUTES ON THE BIKE YOU CAN ACTUALLY KNOCK A THIRTY MINUTE QUOTUNCLE STEADYSTAKE SESSION OUT IN AND NOT FEEL THOSE PROMIS IF THOSE THINGS HAPPENS YOU AN ACTALY HAVE A LOT OF UN THERE WE WILL DO A LOT OF TIMES WITH OUR FIGHTERS WE'LL DO THINGS LIKE PUT A VERY LOW LOAD I'M TALKING SOB FIFTY PER CE OF YOUR MAX ON A BARBILL AND YOU CAN A SQUAK AND YOU CAN DO NO MAYBE A MINUTE YOU CAN A PUT THAT DOWN ANDTHEN YOU CAN TO GO OVER AND DO FIFTY PERCENT OF A BENCH REST U TO PUT THAT DOWN YOU CAN O GO OVER AND DO FIFTY PER CENT OF A OF A CRABLOCK AND YOU CAN GO OVER INDO ANOTHER ONE AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY RUN THO THIS ENTIRE THING YOU DON'T HIT THAT MANY REPS AND ANY INDIVIDUAL MOVEMENT THE LOAD IS VERY VERY LIGHT AND YOU CAN KEEP HARTRATE BAS STEADY STATE IN DO FIFTEEN OR TWENTY OR THIRTY DIFFERENT EXERCISES AND ISECTO A FAIRLY FUN AND ENGAGING  TO DO IN IT'S A LITEBIT MORE SPECIFIC THAN TRYING TO GIVE A TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE POUND AND A FELL PLAYER TO RUN FOR THIRTY MINUTES WHICH IS NOT CAN BE GOOD I'M JUST CHUCKLING BECAUSE I LOVE TO RUN OUT DOORS AH AND I'VE ENJOYED RUNS AN  AN MY TRAVELS AND IF I FIND IT TO BE A GREAT WAY TO SEE DIFFERENT PLACES AT I LIKE MOVING THROUGH SPACE BUT THERE ARE WEATHER CONDITIONS AND TIMES WHEN THAT'S NOT ANOPTIONS TO WHAT YOU DESCRIBED IS A TERRIFIC ALTERNATIVE I HAVE TO ASSUME THAT THE SPECIFIC ADAPTATION THAT'S OCCURRING HERE IS RELATED TO THE FAT BURNING SYSTEM AND AGAIN THAT DOESN'T ASARILY MEAN FAT LOSS GREVER ALL BUT FAT BURNING SYSTEM AND YET I DO HAVE A QUESTION WHICH IS CAN YOU BUILD INHENCED MICROCAPLARY SYSTEMS INTO THE MUSCLES O BY DOING THIS LONG DERATION CARDIA YET ABSOLUTE CAN IN FACT THEPANDING ON WHICH PAPER YOU LIKE MORE THAN THE OTHER PAPERS A YOU MAYVN FIND EVIDENCE THAT THIS IS A SUPERIOR METHOD THEN ANYTHING ELSE A STEADY STATE ENDURANCE IS VERY IMPORTANT I USED TO NOT LIKE IT IS MUCH THERE'S IS SO MUCH EVIDENCE NOW THAT SUGGESTS IT'S PROBABLY A REALLY GOOD THING FOR BASIF EVERYBODY MAYBE FOR SOME INDIVIDUALS IT'S NOT IN ALL YEAR OF THEIR TRAINING BUT IF IF YOU'RE NOT A HIGHLY ALOUT THEY TO HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC GOAL THAT'S RIGHT IN FRONTO YOU IT'S PROBABLY BEST TO DO AT LEAST TWENTY MINUTES AS A MINIMEN MAYBE THIRTY MINUTES OF SOME STEADY STATE EXERCISE ONCE A WEEK FOR BASELY ANY TRAINING GOAL OUTSIDE OF AGAIN A COUPLE OF REALLY SPECIFIC CENARIOS THER HAPPENING I'M THE OTHER THING THAT KINDO KICKS IN HERE THAT WE HAVEN'T REALLY TALKED ABOUT IS NOW OR ACTUALLY REACHING OF POSITION WHERE FATIGUE OF THE INNER COSTLES STARTS TO PLAY SO DIAPHRAMIC FATIGUE STARS TO RUN IN INDICATION SO WE FORGET GENERALLY BREATHING IS A CONTRACTUION TO OPEN UP THE LUNGS TO CHANGE PRESSURE SO THE AIR WILL FLOW IN AND THEN THE EXHOLATION IS PASSIVE RIGHT ITS S A MUSCLES BEEN STRETCH TO GOS BACK TIS RESTING WHEN YOU GET TO A MAXIMUM HEARTRAT INHELLATION AND EXHELLATION BECOME ACTIVE S YOUR SQUEEZINGIS HARDE CAND OPEN UP IN YOUR SQUEEZING TO CONTRACT THE BLOW AIR OUT YOU'RE GOING TO GET FATIGUED THATS SYSTEM RIGHT OVER TIME YOU HAVE CONTRACT TO CONTRACTED OPEN UP IF THAT SYSTEM STARS TO GETE FATIGUE YOU START RUNNING INTO FAILURE HERE SO YOU PRACTISE THAT AND THIS IS WHEN ALL KINDS OF THINGS LIKE BRE ETHING DRILLS TO JUST SIMPLY TRAINING IN THIS FASHION I'M THERE'S ALL KINDS OF EXERCICE DEVICES FOR YOUR LUNGS AND WHEN WE SAY THAT THAT'S WHAT ORATHY TALKING ABOUT THE MUSSCULAR TURE AROUND BELUNGS NEEDS TO NOT FATIGUE SO THAT'S THE ONLY OTHER LITTOOK COMPONIT I WANTED TO THROWIN HERE IF WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT OUS SIT ABOUT FERING WHICH IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE IS NOT A PROBINY THE TIME DOMAIN IS LONG AND SLOW EARTH SO WE HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO USE FAT AS A FEEL WE ALLSO PLENTY OF TIME TO USE ANAROBIC AND AROBIC LIKE CALLS US AND CLEAR OUT WASTE PRODUCTS SO WE DON'T REALLY SEE P GE BEING A PROBLEM WITH THIS TYPE OF EXERCISE YOU MAY START RUNNING LOW ON LIVERIC LIKE A GEN IF YOU'RE GOING A VERY LONG TIME MUSTO LIKEL ON MAY ST OUR GETTING LOW BUT NOT REALLY THESE FOR HUGE ISSUES YOU'RE GOING TO RUN IN TO MAYBE LITTL BIT TO STROKE VOLUME ISSUE BUT ND INTANS HE'S NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO BECOME A PROBLEM YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO BREAK DOWN POSTRLY OR BREATHING MECHANICS THAN REALLY ANYTHING ELSE UNLESS AGAIN THAT DURATION REALLY GETS GENERALLY PASS TWO HOURS FOR MOST PEOPLE SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS ATER GOING TO LIMIT US SO HOW TO WE IMPROVE IT WHEN WE TRAIN WE WENT THROUGH THE EXERCISE CHOICES YOU ALL SOONG TO MAKE SURE YOUR TRAINING YOU'RE INNERCOSTLES WE NEED BE TRAINING OUR DIAFHRAM IN SOME FASHION AGAIN IT CAN BE THE EXERCISE ITSELF CAN BE YOUR NORMAL TRAINING THE THING YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL OF HERE AND THIS IS ACTLY TRUE FOR ALL THE THINGS WE JUST TALKED ABOUT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT FATIGUE AND WE THINK ABOUT FAILURE OF ENDURANCE WE REALLY NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO TECHNICAL BREAK DOWN THAT IS ALWAYS THE MARKER WE LOOK FOR SO WHEN WE WHEN WE GO THROUGH OURSTELF WITH OUR ATHLETES AND THEY QUOUNCLE FAIL ARE THEY FINISH THAT'S GENERALLY BECAUSE WE SAW A MASS OF TECHNICAL BREAK DOWN YOU'RE DONE LIKE YOU'RE OVER THERE NOT ALWAYS THE CASE DURING ALL YOU'R ROUND THE TRAIN BUT THIS IS SOMETHING TO REALLY PAY ATTENTION TO SO IF YOU'RE ON NOT LIKE IN YOUR FORTY SECOND SIN AND ALL SUDDEN POSTURE SERVINTS FOR HUNCHING OVER I MAYH STOP THE TEST I MAY STOP THE TRAINING SIKE NO WILL WE DECIDED FAILURE WAS AS WHEN YOU LOST YOUR TECHNIQUE TO SOME SUFFICIENT LEVEL I SO YOU WANT TO PAY ATTENTI TO THAT TOO BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO DETERMINE YOUR BILLITY TO PERFORM WELL AS WELL AS MAINTAIN EFFICIENCY WHICH IS A REALLY BIG PROPLEMER TELL ME IF THE PROTOCALLM ABOUT TO DESCRIBE WOULD BE A REASONABLE ONE FOR PEOPLE TO INCORPORATE SIXTY TO A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MINUTES OF LONDRATION WORK PER WEEKE SO ONE WAY TO COMPISH THAT THAT I OFTEN USE IS TO HEAT OUT FOR A WAIT VESTED HEIGHT IT'S NOT A HEAVY WEIGHT TEST MAY BE ITHINK IT'S EIGHT OR TEN POUNDS WHEN THESE THINNER ONES AND IF PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT YOU YOU BACK PACK WITH THE ITEMS IN IT I MEAN IT CAN BE I S NY WEN HA EXTERNAL LOD OU CAN DIS BE YOUR BODY SO GET GREAT AND AND DO SOME HEIGHTING AT IT ITA FAST ENOUGH CLIP THAT BREATHING HARDER THAN I WOULD BE IF I JUSCAN A SHUFFLED ALONG I MIGHT STOP HERE THERE DRINK SOME WATER NO BIG DEAL BUT I CAN CARRY ON A CONVERSATION IF I NEED TO SO IT'S AN HIS OWN TO ISH BUT PROBABLY PUSHING A LITTLE BIT HARDER THAN THAT FOR THAT DURATION YET NOT A LOT OF A DEEP SORENESS OCCURRING AFTER THIS MAY BE A LITTLE BIT OF ACHY NESS IN SOME STABLISATION MUSCLES THAT WERE USED TAT MAY NOT BE USED TO MUCH ESPECIALLY F I'VE BEEN SITTING A LOT DURING THE WEEK I'M CANN REMINDS ME OF HOW MUCH I'VE BEEN SITTING ET A BUT DOING THAT ALL IN ONE LONG AFTERNOON I'M TO PRCLY ON A WEEK AND OR DOING TO SHORTER SECTIONS THROUGHOUT THE WEET MAYE FORTY FIVE MINUTE IN FORTY FIVE MINUTES AND THEN WORKING UP THE PROGRESSION TO LONGER LONGER DURATION SEEMS LIKE THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT MOST PEOPLE I'M SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO ET AND THAT IT WOULD WEAVE IN WELL WITH ANY RESISTANCE TRAINING OR THE AUT IN A ROBIC AND A ROBI OUT PUT CAPACITY WORK THAT WE TALKED ABOUT JUST A MOMENT AGO GREAT THAT'S A FINE VERSION TO DO IT IF YOU WANT TO GO SHORTER AND BRING UP THE INTENSITY A LITTLE BIT SO YOU WANT TO KEEP IT MORE TO THE THORTY TO SIXTY MINUTE RANGE AND GO AND CLOSER AND TO THE I CAN'T HAVE A CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW BUT ITGAT I'M NOT AT A BLISTERING HEARTRAHT I'M THEN YOU COULD PROBABLY GET THAT SAMETHING DONE IN A SMALLER TIME WINDOW IF THAT WAS A CONSIDERATION SO IF YOU WANTED TO BLEND ALL THREE OF THESE TOGETHER YOU HAVE A LOT OF WIGGEROM RIGHT SO YOU COULD DO SOMETHING LIKE ORDER IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS TYPE OF TRAINING YOU COULD DO THIS FIRST AND THEN FINISH WITH EITHER ONE OF THE HIGHER INTENSITY STUFF WE TALKED ABOUT SO OU BE ROPED INTO THE SAME THING IF COULD BE IT'S OWN INDEPENDENT DAY COULD BE YOUR SORT OF ACT IVE RECOVERY DA TENDS TO BE FAIRLY RESTORATIVE AS YOU ALLUDED TO A LITTLE BIT THERE SO IT'S NOT THAT BE GOOD DEAL TO DIS ON YOUR Q UNCLE OFFDAY IF YOU'RE THOSE IF YOU'RE THAT TYPE OF PERSON WHO LIKE EVEN ON YOUR OFF TO YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING PHYSICAL THIS IS FINE RIGHT I'M IF YOU WANTED TO DO IT ON A LIFTING DAY SPECIALLY IF IT'S A POWER OF STRENGTH THEY IT'S PROBABLY FINE IF YOU WANTED TO DO IT BEFORE THE WORK OUT OR AFTER IT EITHER WAY YOU'RE PROBABLY O CAKE PROBABLY BEST TO DO AFTER IF THE PRIMARY GOLD IS ONE OF THE STRANGTH RAING AUT OFPATIONE IF IT'S NOT IF THIS IS A PRIME RAGAL DO IT FIRST AMAZING IF YOU WANTED TO DO IT IN THE COMBINATION WITH THE OTHER INDFOL STUFF YOU COULD DO IT FINE THAT YOU COULD DO IT BEFORE OR YOU COULD DO IT AFTERWARDS I ACTUALLY HAVE NO PROBEM DOING AFTERWARDS BECAUSE THAT IN EFFECT ESPECIALLY IF YOU SAY NAZAL ONLY DURING THIS TRAINING WE'LL HELP THE DOWN REGULATION GO AND SO YOU COUL FINISH THAT FAIRLY WELL DOWN REGULATED ACTUALLY SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE A NICE WAY TO GET THOROUGHLY WARMED UP GO REALLY REALLY HARD AND THEN GIVE IT A NICE TWENTY TO THIRTY MINUTE SLO BACK DOWN AND BY THE TIME YOU'VE FINISHED MAYBE EVEN ON A THREE MINUTE WALK NICE SLOW NAZEL FOR SECOND IN HAIL FOR SECOND IN  MAYBE FIVE SE YOU PLAY WITH ANOTHER'S LITTLE BIT THEN MAYBE YO ON'T YOU NEED TO DO THE DOWN REGULATION REATING OFTER YOU'LL BE NY GOOD SPOT YOU W ULDN'T WANT A DO THIS BEFORE DO YOUR INTERVALS FINISH YOUR INTERVALS THROW UP LAY ON THE GROUND SWEAT ALL OVER THE GIM FLOOR GET UP AND GO BACK TO WORK THAT'S PROBING ON OUR BESTRADITY AS PEOPLE ARE HERING THIS ALL THEY MAY BE THINKING WHILE THIS IS A LOT OF WORK TO DO BUT I'VE BEEN KEEPING TRACK OF THE MAT HERE SOME SURE SOM THE AUTHER ARE AS WELL AND WE REALLY TALKING ABOUT TEN MINUTES OF THE OF RUNNING OR SPRINTING ON THE BYY CAROER ONCE A WEEK ERE TUG ABOUT SIX MINUTES OR SO OF THE MUCH HIGHER INTENSITY BUT SHORT BOUTS DIVIDIN DO ROUNDS OF TWENTYTA TWENTY SECONDS TO A MINUTE WITH WITH REST IN BETWEEN AND THEN SOME LONGER DURATION WORK OUT OF THIRTY MINUTES MENIMUM BUT MAY BE AS MUCH AS AN HOUR EVEN TWO HOURS WHICH IN TOTAL DOESN'T REALLY ECQUAITE TO THAT MUCH TIME ESPECIALLY IF ONE CAN ACCESS THESE THINGS RIGHT OUT THEIR FRONT DOOR OR AT HOME AND AS WE POINT OUT YOU DON'T NEED ANY SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT TO DO THAT OH AND I FORGOT THE AM A MUSCULAR ENDURANCE WEI THAT WASN'T TRYING TO CHEAT THERE THAM SOME MUSCULAR ENDURANCE THROWN IN AS WELL SO THAT BRINGS ME TO A QUESTION WHICH IS IF I'M DOING MY TRAINING FOR MUSCULAR ENDURANCE EACH WEEK FOR ANEROBIC CAPACITY AND FOR MAXIMUMMOROBIC OUTPUT AND LONG DURATION AND GIVEN THAT ALL OF THAT AND TAKE ROUGHLY TWO HOURS FOR THE TYPICAL PERSON TOTAL FOR THE ENTIRE WEEK WHICH I WOULD ARGUE IS GOING TO GIVE YOU BACK SO MUCH LIFE ONLAT EARLY IN TERMS OF LUNCHEVITY OR LITERLY AND EARNING BACK YOURS OF YOUR LIFE PRODUCTIVITY BE NAME OFFSETTING ALL SORTS OF A METABOLIC ISSUES AND US ENHANCING YOUR SLEEP AND AND IIMPROVING MOOD AND THEIR SO MUCH DATA SO MUCH DATA POINTING TO ALL THOSE POSITIVE BENEFITS IF I DO ALL OF THESE THINGS AND I'M FAIRLY CONSISTENT ABOUT THEM IN MY GOING TO BE MENABOLICALLY FLEXIBLE AN MY GOING TO HAVE A WELL DEVELOPED FAT BURNING CARBORHYDRATE BURNING SYSTEM AND WILL I BE ESSENTIALLY FIT I MEAN THIS IS NOT LEAVING ASIDE ISSUES OF STRENGTH AND HYPURCHAFOROUAR COVERED IN IN THE PREVIOUS EPISODE WILL I BE FIT I MEAN TO MY MIND A THE ABILITY TO YOU KNOW SPRINT VERY FAST IF ONE NEEDS TO THE ABILITY GO LONGER DURATION IF ONE NEEDS TO AND THE ABILITY DO SOMETHING IN BETWEEN AS WELL AS YOU'NL A HOLD A BOX OVERHEAD IF NECESSARY I'M WELL IN STALLING A SHELL OR SOMETHING LI DON MES OF THE REALITIES OF LIFE AM AND TO ME REPRESENT REAL FUNCTIONAL WORLD FITNESS IF THAT'S THE CASE IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WE WANT TO ADD TO THIS PROGRAMMER WOULD YOU CONSIDER THAT OF FAIRLY COMPREHENSIVE IN COMPLET ENDURANCE TRAINING SYSTEM IF WE REMEMBER THE TARGET WHICH IS I WANT TO HAVE ENERGY I WANT A LOOK A CERTAIN WAY AND YOU OUGT ABABLE TO DO THAT FOR THE DURATION OF YOUR LIFE FOR A VERY LONG LIFE THIS STYLE OF TRAINING WERE YOU INCORPORATE ALLOF THOSE AREAS OF ENDURANCE GIVES YOU ALL THE NECESSARY ADAPTATIONS ONE WOULD NEED TO EXCUTE ALL OF THOSE THINGS REMEMBER FAT LOSS OR WAIT MANAGEMENT IS NOT BEST DONE WITH ANY INDIVIDUAL STYLE O PROTOCOL SO IF YOU DO A LITTLE BIT OF ALL THREE THES YOU'VE CHECKED THAT FAT LOSS BOX YOU DON'T NEED TO GO ON DO ANYTHING SEPARATE FOR IT YOU'VE DONE ALL THE THINGS THEN TO COVERESTHETICS FROM THAT SIDETHE QUATION RIM YOU'VE DONE THE THINGS TO BOTH AN HANDSMIO CONDURY TO ENHANE BLOOD FLOW INCREASE OXYGENATION AND MANAGE FATIGUE AND WASTE DEVELOPMENT BU ENERGIES THERE FATIGUE IS THATE I'M NOT GOING TO GET TIRED OR HAVE TO QUIT OR STOP OR SET DOWN DOING ANY THES ACTIVITIES I WON AT THE SAME TIME IF YOU LOOK AT THE LITERATURE ON MORTALITY ONE OF THESE STRONGEST PREDICTORS OF HOW LONG YOU'RE GOING TO LIVE IS YOUR VEAL TO MACTS SO WEU'VE SET UP A SENARAON WHICH YOU'RE GOING TO GET ALL THREE OF THOSE PRIMARY GULLS BY DOING A COMBINATION OF THIS TRAINING YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MISS ANY PLAUSIBLE ADAPTATION FROM ENDURANCE TRAINING AND YOU SHOULD BE SET FOR REGARDLESS OF YOUR GOAL INCREDIBLE AND AS I UNDERSTAND TOTALLY COMPATIBLE WITH STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHY TRAINING PROVIDED THAT YOUR GOAL IS TO ALSO BE STRONG AND ALSO SELECTIVELY HYPERTROPHE OR GENERALLY HYPERTROPHY YOUR MUSCLES OR MAINTAIN YOUR MUSCLES FOR MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE LISTENING TO THIS I'M GUESSING THAT THEY HAVE AN INTEREST IN BUILDING MORE ENDURANCE BUT NOT JUST THE ABILITY GO FURTHER BUT THE ABILITY TO GO A GIVEN DISTANCE AT A HIGHER SPEED AND TO DO WITH BETTER FORM AND TO BREATHE BETTER AND TO FEEL BETTER BEFORE DURING IT AFTER FOR THOSE FOLKS MAYBE YOU COULD SPELL OUT A PROGRAMM THAT COMBINES THESE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF ENDURANCE AND DOES SO IN A WAY THAT INFORMS HOW FOR INSTANCE ATHE HIGHER INTENSITY SHORT DURATION SPRINCE WOULD BE EXPECTED TO IMPROVE THEIR LONGER DURATION WORK AND HOW PERHAPS THEIR LONGER DURATION WORK OM CAN PROGRESS IF THEY ARE CAREFUL TO INCLUDE I SOMEPLANKS IN SOME WALLSETS AND AND THINGS OF THAT SORT I ASK THIS QUESTION SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE I HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT WHILE THEY'RE PROBABLY AR SOME FOLKS OUT THERE THEIR LOOKING TO MAXIMISE THEIR PLANK FROM WEEK TO WEEK TO WEEK TIPITALLY IT SEEMS THAT PEOPLE FALL INTO THESE CATEGORIES OF EITHER WANT AND GET STRONGER AND GET BIGGER MUSCLES TO VARYING DEGREES OR TO GET BETTER AT ENDURANCE OR TO GET BETTERED EVERYTHING OVER ALL RIGHT NOW I'D REALLY LIKE YOU JIST FOCUS ON WHAT YOU THINK IS A NICE CONTOUR OF A PROGRAMM FOR THE PERSON THAT WANTS TO GET BETTER AT ENDURANCE BUT DO IT WITH MORE SPEED MORE STABILITY ANDJUST FEEL LIKE A STRONG ENDURANCE RUNNER CYCLER SWIMMER OR WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BE THEIR ENDURANCE EVENT O GET GREAT SO LE TISGIF AN EXAMPLE MAYBE YOU ON A RUN YOUR FIRST HALF MARTHON SOMETHING LIKE THAT I I MAY BE DONE A COUPLE TIMES FORBUT YOU'VE WANTO GET BETTER AT THAT TIME I WOULD PROBABLY PUT SOMEWHERE THE EIHBRHOODS SIXTY TO SEVENTY PER CENT OF YOUR IN A MILAGE IN THE MODERATE INTENSITY ISOWN CASS YOU NEED TO ACCUMULATE MILAGE AND YOU NEED TO BEABLE TO HANDLE WHAT WE CALL THE TISSUE TOLERANCE SO IN THIS CASE YOUR FEET NEED TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE THIRTEEN MILES OF POUNDING DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH HIGH HEART RATE TRAINING YOU DO OR YOUR FAT DELIVERABILITY NONE OF THAT MATTERS IF YOUR FEET ARE BLOWN UP BY MILE EIGHT THE CATE SO IN ADDITION WE TALKED ABOUT HOW EVEN TRAINING IN THAT SEVENTY TO EIGHTY FIVE PER CENT HEART RATE ZOWN IS QUITE EFFECTIVE AT OXYGEN DELIVERY FAT UTILIZATION CAPITIZATION ET CETERA SO YOU'RE GOING TO GET A LOT OF DIRECT ENDURANCE BENEFITS FROM THAT WORK YOU'RE ALSO GOING TO BE WORKING ON WHAT'S HONESTY GOING TO BE ONE OF YOUR LIMITING FACTORS WHICH IS THT TISSUE TOLERANCE IN THAT POUNDING CAE IN ADDITION YOU NEED TO BE EFFICIENT WITH YOUR TECHNIQUE AND YOU NEED A LOT OF REPETITIONS FOR MOTOR SCILL DEVELOPMENT SO YOU OAASPEEN MOST YOUR TIME THERE IT'S EASY TO RECOVER FROM ITS NOT EXTREMELY A DEMANDING IN CHALLENGING ALSO THAT LEAVES YOU IN ANOTHER THIRTY OR FORTY PER CENT OF TRAINING I WOULD SPEND TEN PER CENT OF THAT IN THAT LIKE TWENTY SECOND BURST AREA YOU CAN A DRIVE OP FATIGUE EXTREMELY HIGH AND YOU CAN REALLY MAXIMISE YOURBY RECOVER FROM A WASTE PRODUCTION A RIGHT GREAT I WOULD SPEND THE REMAINING AMOUNT OF TIME EITHER ON A LITTLE BIT OF ACTUALLY MAXIMUM SPEED STUFF THAT COULD ACTUALLY BE IN THE TWENTY SECOND BIRST IF YOURE REALLY TRYING TO GO AS FAST AS YOU CAN AT THE BEGINNING OF THAT EXERCISE AND THEN THE REST OF IT I WOULD SPEND IN THAT OTHER ZONE WHICH IS MORE OF LIKE THE FIVE SO FIFTEEN MINUTES BUT YOU'RE PROBLIG AN A WANT O REPEAT THOSE AND THIS IS WHEN THINGS LIKE EIGHT HUNDR METER RUN REST FOR DOUBLE THE TIME AND THEN REPEAT THAT TWO OR THREE TIMES YOU ACTUALLY NEED THAT IN THIS CENAREO BECAUSE YOURE GUN O WUL NEED TO BE ABLE TO BE RUNNING FOR TWO MUST BE PITIN TO HALF MARTHONER MAY BE ROUND TWO HOURS OR SO SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND SO YOU WANT A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT WE CALL REPEATED ENDURANCE RIANT SO BE ABLE TO HANDLE THAT HIGHER HOR RATE COME BACK DOWN DO IT AGAIN AT THE SAME TIME THAT'S ACTUALLY HOW YOU BUMP YOUR MILAGE SO INSTEAD OF HAVING THIS DO MORE OF THESE LONG DURATION DISTANCE RUNS YOU CAN STILL GET MAY BE FIVE OR SIX MILES DONNER TO DAY IF YOU CIN TO DO ONE MILE REPEAT OR WHUTDEVER NUMBER YOUR LOOKING AT SO FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT'S KIND OF HOW I WOULD STRUCTURE IT A'M THAT'S OU ONESEA IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE LAID OUT IN THE PREVIOUS CONVERSATION WHICH IS GETTING THIS IDEA THAT MORE THAN FIFTY PER CENT SHOULD BE BASILY PRACTICE A LITTLA BIT A WORK AT THE VERY TOP AND THI SPECTRO BUT NOT TOO MUCH THEN A LITTLEBE TO WORK AT THE OTHER END AND YOU SHOULD MEIN O GOOD SPOT A MAJOUR MISTAKE ONE WOULD MAKE HERE IS ONLY DOING THE LONG DURATION STEADY STATE STUFF AND THIS SORT OF SAYING I'M GET A RUN FIVE MILE THIS WAS WEEK IN THAN DO SIX MILES NEXT WEEK AND SEVEN AT SAID AT MIGHT WORK FOR YOU IS I THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE AT THIS POINT BOTH IN THIS SCIENTIFIC ROUND AS WELL AS MOST OF THE COACHES I THINK IN THIS SPACE WOULD AGREE WITH ME IS THAT'S E SUBOPTIMOSTRA TIGY SO IT COULD WORK BUT WE CAN DO BETTER IN TERMS OF THE STRUCTURE OF A PROGRAMM LIKE THIS I REALIZE IT THOSE STRUCTURES VERY TREMENDOUSLY DIFFERENT COACH IS AND EVERY LAKSIN TEREIN PROGRAMS AREGON TO SAY OW YOU SHOULD RUN MONEY THROUGH FRIDAY WITH WEEK ENDS OFF FOR EVERY OTHER DAY BUT IN TERMS OF THIS SEVENTY PER CENT OM THIRTY PER CENT DIVIDE WORTH SEVENTY PER CENT IS GOING TOWARD THE SPECIFIC EVENT YOU'RE DOING THE KIND OF WORK THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO DURING THE SPECIFIC EVENT THAT YOU'RE MOST INTERESTED IN CULTIVATING OR INPROVEINCAR AND THE REMAINING THIRTY PER CENT COMING FROM OTHER SORTS OF A  SUPPORTING A WORK HOW SHOULD ONE THING ABOUT DISTRIBUTING THAT OTHER THIRTY PER CENT SHOULD IT BE ALL GEAR TOWARDS MAXIMIZING RECOVERY FOR THE SEVENTY PER CENT OR IN OTHER WORDS I'M COULD I DO ALL THAT THIRTY PER CENT WORK ON ONE DAY I PROBABLY WAS PUT INTO TWO DAYS I THAT'S TRE I OF IT IS SO IF YOU'RE THINKING MAN COACH WANTS ME TO TRAIN SIX DAYS A WEEK MY SKEDS WILS TIGHT I CAN PULL OFF FORTIFIVE OH CAKE GREAT WHAT I MIGHT SAY IS TWO OF THOSE DAYS ARE JUST YOUR YOUR TEMPLE MY THIS WHAT LIKE A RUNNO WOLD CALL US A TEMPLE TRAINING I'M KIND OF IN THAT SPACE REMIND US WIT TEMPLE TRAINING IS TIHE IS LIKE OIN FEEDA EIGHTY PER CEND EFFORT RANE REELECT RUNNING AT PROBABLY THE SAME STRIDE LENGTH AND AND RATE THAT YOU CAN RUN YOUR RACE AT MAY BE LOTTLE BUT LOWER BUT SOMETHING SIMILAR YOURE PRACTICING SKILL YOU'RE CRUING MILE AGE ANDYU'RE GETTING A LITTLE YOU'RE GETTING WORK AND FOR SURE WORK BUT IT'S NOT ABSOLUTELY FASTESS YOU CAN SPRENT AN'S ALSO NOT CONVERSATION SO THIS WOULD BE THE UM WHAT BEFORE WE REFER TO AS THE TEN MINUTES OF OF FAST RUNNING WHAT TEN MINUTES OF FAST RUIN IT THIS IS LOWER INTENSITY  GOT IT THIS IS A THIS IS WORK ACCUMULATION GOT IT THIS IS PRACTISED IM THEN ONE OF THE DAYS A WEEK I WOULD PROBABLY ENTER IN THAT TWENTY SECOND THIRTY SECOND BURST FOR A LITTLE BIT OF SPEED THERE AND THEN ONE OF THE OTHER DAYS AS WHEN I WOULD DO THAT TRUE HIGH INTENSITY AS HARD AS I CAN FOR HITTING O VEAL TO MAC SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO THAT'S PROBABLY HOW I BREAK UP IF I HAD LIKE FOUR DAYS A WEEK IF YOU HAD FIVE YOU CAN MAY BE ADD IN ANOTHER DAY READOU MORE OF THAT A VOLUME ACCUMULATION PRACTICE WORK IBUT THAT'S THAT'S A PRETTY TO SPLIT THIS IS THE POINT IN THE EPISODE WHERE I SAY THANK YOU EVER SO MUCH YOU PROVIDED AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF INCREDIBLY INTERESTING CLEAR INFORMATION THAT'S ALSO ACTIONABLE I DO FEEL AS IF I FAR BETTER UNDERSTAND ENDURANCE IN ITS MANY FORMS AND EVEN THE CELLER UNDER PINNINGS OF THAT AND EVEN SUBSELLER UNDER PINNINGS OF WHAT ENDURANCE ADAPTATIONS ARE AND HOW TO FOSTER THOSE THROUGH SPECIFIC PROTOCALS THINGS THAT NOT ONLY I CAN DO TOMORROW BITH IT I WILL DO TOMORRO AND WHERE I HIT MY PAIN POINTS I'LL UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING AND THE ADAPTATION THAT I'M TRIGGERING WHEN MY LEGS ARE BURNING OR I'M SUCKING PRAYER THROUGH MY MOUTH OR I CAN CALMLY MOVE ALONG JUST THROUGH NAZAL BREATHING I WILL NOW KNOW WHAT'S HAPPE NING IN MY BODY AND THE SPECIFIC ADAPTATIONS THAT I'M TRIGGERING  THEN YOU ALSO HIGHLIT SOMETHING THAT IS VIDEDLY IMPORTANT AND I'V NEVER HEARD IT PHRASED AS CLEARLY AS YOU DID TO DAY WHICH IS THAT IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER HOW ONE SEEKS OUT TO ACHIEVE THAT LOSS PROVIDED CERTAIN CRITERIARE MET EVEN WHILE CERTAIN FORMS OF EXERCISE TAPPEN TO FAT STORES MORE THAN OTHERS AND YOU BEAUTIFULLY ILLUSTRATED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ENERGILIZATION AND BREATHING AND THE FACT THAT WE LITERALLY EXHALE FAT TO SOME EXTENT COURSE SO ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU THANK YOU AND THANK YOU I KNOW I'M NOT ALONE IN ON RECOGNIZING THIS INFORMATION AS INCREDIBLY INTERESTING AND INACTIONABLE AND INDEED I DO PLAN TO PUT IT INTO ACTIONS I HOPE I MANY OF OUR ILLUSTNERS WILL AS WELL YET AGAIN THE PLEASURE IS ACTUALLY ALL MINE AND A I ACTUALLY REALLY APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU LET ME GO SO FAR IN A METABOLISM I PIISTY IS IN HUMAN BY ON ORGETICS SO ANY TIME I CAN GO MANY HOURS IN A METABOLISM I GET VERY EXCITEDG AND I DON'T TYPICALLY GET THAT LEASH I IN THIS FARMASSO  APPRECIATE THAT I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND YOUR ODIANS WIL LOVE THAT HOPEFULLY OH THE THEY'LL LOVE IT AND I THINK THAT THEY'LL ESPECIALLY LOVE IT BECAUSE THEY NDERSTAND THAT IF ONE CAN RAPTER HEAD ROUND EVEN JUST AS SMALL FRACTION OF THE MECHANISMS THAT UNDERLIE GIVEN PROTO CAL IT GIVES BOTH TERMEN IS DEPTH AND MEANING TO THAT PROTOCAL AND MAKES IT SO MUCH MORE FLEXIBLE FOR PEOPLE THAY CAN REALLY THINK ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING AS THEIR ENGAGING AN GIVEN PROTOCAL AND KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY CAN EXPACT IN TERMS OF RESULTS GREAT WE'VE BEEN ON A BIT OF A JOURNEY HERE WEE COVERED A LOT GROUND WITH SPEED DEVELOPMENT AND STRENGTH AND I PERTOPY AND NOW WE WALK THROUGH AN PROBABLY SEVERAL HOURS HERE OF OF ENDURANCE WHAT I WOULD LOVE TO DO NEXT IS TO JUST GIVE YOU AND MORT STRAIGHTFORWARD NOT AS MUCH BACKGROUND NOT AS MUCH METABOLISM NONE OF THE MECHANISMS RIGHT INTO PROTOCALLS FOR SOMEONE WHO SAYS LOOK I WANT TO HIT THOSE MARKS YOU KEEP TALKING ABOUT I WAN LOOK GOOD ON A FEEL GOOD I WANT TO DO THAT ACROSS MY LIFE SPEN HOW WOULD I BUILD ALL THESE THINGS INTO A PROTOCALL THAT ACTUALLY COVERS MAY BE THE ENTIRE YEAR AND HOW WOULD I WOULD BE ABLE TO REPEAT THAT YEAR AFTER YEAR SO I ALMOST HAVE THIS EVER GREEN SUSTAINABLE YEAR LONG PEARITIZATION STRUCTURE THAT COVERS ALL THE KNOS I NEED TO IF I WANT EVERYTHING WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IN THESE NINE ADAPTATIONS IN THIS SHORT SERIS SO HOW WOULD LOVE TO DO THAT OUR NEXT CONVERSATION IF YOUR LEARNING FROM AND OR ENJOYING THIS PODCAST PLEASE SUBSCRIBE TO OUR YOU TO CHANNEL THAT'S A TERRIFIC ZERO COSTWAY TO SUPPORT US IN

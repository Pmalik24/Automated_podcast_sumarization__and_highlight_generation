WITHOUT FURTHER ADO LET'S GET TO ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS AND AS ALWAYS I WILL TRIVE TO BE AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE AS SUCINCT AS POSSIBLE AND AS THOROUGH AS POSSIBLE WHILE STILL ANSWERING AS MANY QUESTIONS PUR A M A EPISODE AS I CAN WITHOUT THESE SESSIONS BECOMING UNREASONABLY LONG I SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT IF YOU ASKED A QUESTION AND IT WAS NOT ANSWERED THIS A M A IT MAY VERY WELL BE ANSWERED IN THE NEXT A M A SO THE FIRST QUESTION WHICH HAD A LOT OF UP BOATS MEANING MANY PEOPLE WANTED THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION CAME FROM JACKSON LIP FORT AND THE QUESTION WAS ABOUT SO CALLED ALTRADIAN RHYTHMS FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH ALTRADIANG RHYTHMS ALTRADIAN RHTHMS ARE ANY RHYTHMS THAT ARE SHORTER THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND TYPICALLY WHEN PEOPLE ASK ABOUT OR TALK ABOUT ALLTRADIN RHYTHMS THEY ARE REFERRING TO NINETY MINUTE RHYTHMS HAVE TALKED ABOUT THESE ON THE PODCAST BEFOR AND JACKSON'S QUESTION WAS HOW DO YOU USE ULTRADIAN RHYTHMS IN YOUR DAILY WORK THEREIS MORE TO THE QUESTION BUT FIRST OFF I DO USE ALTRADIAN RHYTHMS THAT IS I LEVERAGE THE FACT THAT THESE DO EXIST IN ALL OF US AS A WAY TO ENGAGE IN FOCUSED BOUTS OF MENTAL WORK ONCE OR TWICE OR SOMETIMES THREE TIMES PER DAY HOWEVER I USE THEM IN A WAY THAT'S GROUNDED IN THE RESEARCH ON ALTRADIANG RHYTHMS FOR LEARNING AND MEMORY IN A WAY THAT MIGHT NOT BE OBVIOUS JUST FROM THEIR NAME THAT THEY ARE NINETY MINUTE RHYTHMS SOLL GET INTO THE DETAILS OF HOW TO USE ALTRADIN RHYTHMS TO BEST CAPTURE NURO PLASTICITY THAT IS THE BRAINSABILITY TO CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO EXPERIENCE AND IN A WAY THAT SHOULD ALLOW YOU TO GET ONE OR TO OR MAYBEVEN THREE FOCUSD BOUTS OF LEARNING PER DAY WHICH CAN GREATLY ACCELERATE LEARNING OF COGNIM MATERIAL LANGUAGES MATHEMATICS HISTORY FOR SAKE OF SCHOOL OR WORK OR MAYBE JUST A HOBBY OR PERSONAL INTERESTS OF SOME SORT AND FOR SKILL LEARNING IN THE PHYSICAL DOMAIN AS WELL JACKSON THEN WENT ON TO ASK YOU'VE MENTION BEFORE THAT YOU TRY TO INCLUDE AT LEAST ONE NINETY MINUTE FOCUS BLOCK PER DAY AS PART OF YOUR WORK AN OVER ALL MISSION AND INDEED THAT IS TRUE I TRY TO GET AT LEAST ONE OF THESE FOCUSED ULTRADIAN RHYTHM BLOCKS PER DAY THAT IS A PERIOD OF ABOUT NINETY MINUTES WHERE I'M FOCUSED ON LEARNING SOMETHING ARE DOING SOMETHING THAT'S COGNIATIVELY HARD ALTHOUGH TYPICALLY I AIM FOR TWO OF THESE SESTSIONS PER DAY HE THEN GOES ON TO ASK WHAT IS THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF BLOCKS YOU CAN PERFORM SUSTAINABLY THE ANSWER TO THAT IS PROBABLY FOR AND I SAY PROBABLY BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE HAVE SCHEDULES LIFE STYLES IN WHICH FOR NINETY MINUTE BLOCKS OF FOCUS LEARNING IS POSSIBLE PER DAY BUT THAT'S HIGHLY UNUSUAL FOR MOST PEOPLE IT'S GOING TO BE ONE OR TWO MAYBE THREE FOR I WOULD PLACE IN THE REALLY EXTRAORDINARY END OF THINGS MAYBE IF YOU'R CRAMMING FOR EXAMS OR YOU'VE MANAGE TO GO ON A WRITING RETREAT OR A LEARNING RETREAT OF SOME SORT WHERE YOU CAN DEVOTE ESSENTIALLY ALL OF YOUR NON SLEEPING NON EATING TIME TO LEARNING BUT MOST PEOPLE SIMPLY CAN'T ORGANIZE THEIR LIFE THAT WAY SO THE SHORT ANSWER IS FOR ME IT'S ONE OR TWO PER DAY IS THE TARGET AND THREE WOULD BE THE MAXIMUM HE THEN WENT ON TO ASK DO YOU TAKE VACATIONS OR EXTENDED BRAKES FROM THESE ULTRADIAN RHYTHM SESSIONS AND THE SHORT ANSWER IS NO TYPICALLY I TRY AND DO THIS EVERY DAY AND YES EVEN ON THE WEEK ENDS BUT ON THE WEEK END THE ELTRADIAN RHYTHM FOCUSE LEARNING BOUT MIGHT JUST BE READING A BOOK FOR ABOUT NINETY MINUTES OR SO WHICH MIGHT NOT BE AS COGNITIVELY DIFFICULT AS IT IS FOR OTHER SORTS OF WORK THAT I PERFORMD DURING THE WEEK I OCCASIONALLY MISS A DAY ENTIRELY FOR WHATEVER REASON TRAVEL OBLIGATIONS RELATE THO FAMILY CETERA BUT IN GENERALINE TRY AN DO THIS EVERY DAY I DO THINK THAT THE CIRCUITS FOR FOCUS ARE I GUESS THE NON BIOLOGICAL WAY TO PUT IT WOULD BE KEPT WARM BUT ESSENTIALLY THAT ACCESSING THE CIRCUITS FOR FOCUS IS MADE EASIER BY AXISING THEM REGULARLY AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE CIRCUITS FOR FOCUS ARE INDEED THEMSELVES AMENABLE TO NEURAL PLASTICITY IN OTHER WORDS THE MORE YOUV FORCE YOURSELF TO FOCUS THE EASIER FOCUSING GETS I'LL NOW ANSWER THE LAST PART OF THE QUESTION AND THEN I WILL GO THROUGH AND EMPHASIZE SOME TOOLS THAT ANY ONE CAN USE IN ORDER TO LEVERAGE ULTRADIAN RHYTHMS TOWARD LEARNING BOUTS EITHER COGNIVE LEARNING OR PHYSICAL SKILL LEARNING OR A COMMINATION OF THE TWO THE LAST PART OF THE QUESTION JACKSON ASKED WAS IF YOU KNEW YOU NEEDED TO DRASTICALLY INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF FOCS YOU DO DAILY HOW WOULD YOU SCHEDULE THAT FOCUS AND RECOVER FROM IT THAT'S AN EXCELLENT ASPECT TO THIS QUESTION AND I WILL NOW GIVE YOU THE DETAILS OF HOW I WOULD USE AND SCHEDUAL ULTRADING RHTHMS I'LL OFFER YOU A TOOL I'VE NEVER TALKE ABOUT THIS TOOON HUREMAN LABPODCAST AND I WILL DISPEL A COMMON MYTH ABOUT ULTRADIAN RHYTHMS THAT POINTS TO A LEAVER NOT AN EASIER WAY TO LEVERAGE THEM FOR MAXIMUM BENEFIT O CASSO AS I MENTION BEFORE ULTRA DEAN RHYTHMS ARE THESE NINETY MINUTE CYCLES THAT WE GO THROUGH FROM THE TIME THAT WE ARE BORN UN TIL THE TIME WE DIE INDEED EVEN DURING SLEEP WE ARE EXPERIENCING AND MORE LESS GOVERNED BY THESE ALTRADEIN RHYTHMS THIS QUESTION AND THIS ANSWER IS NOT SO MUCH ABOUT SLEEP BUT JUST KNOW THAT WHEN YOU GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT UNTIL YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING EVERY NINETY MINUTES OR SO YOUR PATTERNS OF SLEEP THAT IS THE PERCENTAGE OR RATIO RATHER OF SLOW WAVE SLEEP TO LIGHT SLEEP TO RAPID IVE MOVEMENT SLEEP CHANGES IN A WAY SUCH THAT EACH NINETY MINUTE CYCLE GATES THE NEXT CYCLIS CER FLIPS THE ON SWITCH FOR THE NEXT NINETY MINUTE CYCLE THAN THAT NINETYMUTE CYCLE ENDS FLIPS THE ON SWITCH FOR THE NEXT ONE AND SO ON AND SO FORTH I MENTION ALL THAT BECAUSE DURING THE DAYTIME THE SAME THING IS TRUE BUT MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE NINETY MINUTE ALTRADEAN CYCLES BEGIN BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT YOU COULD WAKE UP ON THE BASIS OF AN ALARM CLOCK OR NOISE IN THE ROOM OR SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU NATURALLY WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ALTRADEAN NINETY MINUTE CYCLE SO DOES THAT MEAN FOR INSTANCE THAT IF YOU WAKE UP SIXTY MINUTES INTO AN ULTRADEAN CYCLE THAT THE NEXT THIRTY MINUTES OF YOUR WAKING RIGHT BECAUSE THAT SIXTY MINUTES NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO NINETY TO COMPLETE O ULTRADEAN CYCLE THAT THE NEXT THIRTY MINUTES AFTER WAKING ARE RELATED TO THE ULTRADEAN CYCLE THAT YOU WERE STILL IN DURING SLEEP OR DOES IT START A NEW ALTRADEAN CYCLE AND THE ANSWER IS THE FORMER THAT ULTRADAN CYCLE CONTINUES EVEN IF YOU WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF IT AND SO A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO LEVERAGALTRADEAN CYCLES FOR LEARNING WSAY WHELL HOW DO I KNOW WHEN TO START ONE DOES IT START WHEN I HIT MY STOP WATCH CAN I JUST SET A CLOCK AND WORK FOR NINETY MINUTES ANDTHE SHORT ANSWER IS NOW AND TAT MIGHT SEEM UNFORTUNATE BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT YOU CAN FIGURE OUT WHEN YOUR FIRST PROPER ULTRADEAN CYCLE OF THE DAY BEGINS SIMPLY BY ASKING YOUR SELF WHEN ARE YOU MOST ALERT AFTER WAKING THAT IS IF YOU WERE SAY TO WAKE UP AT SEVEN A M AND LET' SAY THAT'S THE END OF AN ULTRADEAN CYCLE OR PERHAPS YOURE IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ALTRADEAN CYCLE DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU NEED TO WATCH FOR OR PAY ATTENTION TO FOR A DAY OR SO IS WHEN YOU START TO EXPERIENCE YOURE GREATEST STATE OF MENTAL ALERTNESS IN THE MORNING AND HERE WE CAN DISCARD WITH ALL THE ISSUES AND VARIABLES AROUND CAFFINE OR NO CAFFIN HYDRADING OR NO HYDRADING EXERCISE IS ONE VARIABLE THAT WILL CONSIDER IN A MOMENT BUT HERE'S THE DEAL THESE ULTRADEN CYCLES ARE ACTUALLY TRIGGERED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN THE SO CALL GLUCOCORTICOID SYSTEM THE SYSTEM THAT REGULATES CARTIS ALL RELEASE AND AS SOME OF YOU PROBABLY HEARD ME SAY BEFORE CORTIS ALL EVEN THOUGH IT'S OFTEN DISCUSSED AS A TERRIBLE THING ITS UNOCHRONIC STRESS CORTISAL CORTISAL ET CETERA CORTIS ALL IS ESCENTIAL FOR HEALTH AND EVERY DAY WE GET A RISING CARTIS ALL IN THE MORNING THAT IS ASSOCIATE WITH ENHANCED DE MUN FUNCTION AN HANCED ALERTNESS AN HANCETABILITY TO FOCUS SO ON AND SO FORTH IN FACT THE PROTOCALL THAT I'M ALWAYS BEATING THE DRUM ABOUT THAT PEOPLE SHOULD GET SUNLIGHT IN THEIR EYES AS CLOSE TO WAKING AS POSSIBLE THAT ACTUALLY INHANCES ERE INCREASES THE PEAK LEVEL OF CORTIS ALL THAT'S EXPERIENCED EARLY IN THE DAY AND THAT SETS IN MOTION A NUMBER OF THESE ALLTRADEIN CYCLES SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOU WAKE UP AT SEVEN A M AND YOU FIND THAT FOR THE FIRST HOUR AFTER WAKING YOU TEN TO BE A LITTLE BIT GROGGY OR YOU HAPPEN TO BE GROGGY ON A GIVEN DAY BUT THEN YOU NOTICE THAT YOUR ATTENTION ALERTNESS STARTS TO PEAK SOMEWHERE AROUND NINE THIRTY A M OR TEN A M YOU CAN BE PRETTY SURE THAT THAT FIRST ALL TRADIAN CYCLE FOR LEARNING IS GOING TO BE OPTIMAL TO START AT ABOUT NINE THIRTY OR TEN A M HOW CAN I SAY ABOUT IF IT'S INDEED A NINETY MINUTE CYCLE WELL THIS IS REALLY WHERE THE UNDERLYING NEUROBIOLOGY IN THESE ALTRADIAN CYCLES CONVERGE TO GIVE YOU A SPECIFIC PROTOCOL THE CHANGES IN CARTIS ALL THAT OCCUR THROUGHOUT THE DAY INVOLVE YES A BIG PEAK EARLY IN THE DAY IF YOU'RE GETTING YOUR SUNLIGHT AND CAFFIN AND MAYBE EVEN SOME EXERCISE EARLY IN THE DAY BUT TYPICALLY THAT PEAK COMES EARLY AND THEN ACROSS THE DAY THE BASE LINE GITTERS ALIOBIT IT COMES DOWN BUT ITBOUNCES OGHOUT A LIBIT IT'S NOT A FLAT LINE IF WE WERE TO MEASURE YOUR LUCUCORTICOID LEVELS EACH ONE OF THOSE LITTLE BUMPS CORRESPONDS TO A SHIFT IN THESE ALL TRADEIN CYCLES SO IF YOU FIND THAT YOU ARE MOST ALERT AT NINE THIRTY OR STARTING TO BECOME ALERT AT NINE THIRTY AND THEN TYPICALLY YOU HAVE A PEAK OF FOCUS AND CONCENTRATION AROUND TEN A M THAT IS REALLY VALUABLE TO KNOW BECAUSE THE WAY THAT THE MOLECULES THAT CONTROL NURO PLASTICITY THAT IS THE CHANGES IN NURONS AND OTHER SELLTYPES IN THE BRAIN THAT ALLOW YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM TO LEARN AND LITERALLY FOR NEW CONNECTIONS TO FORM BETWEEN YURONS WHICH IS BASICALLY THE BASIS OF LEARNING THOSE FLUCTUATE ACCORDING TO THESE UL TRADEIN CYCLES WHAT DOES THIS MEAN THIS MEANS IF YOUR PEAK IN ALERTNESS AND FOCUS AND ENERGY COULD EVEN BE EXPERIENCES PHYSICAL ENERGY OCCURS AT ABOUT NINE THIRTY A M I WOULD START YOUR FIRST ALTRADAN CYCLE FOR LEARNING SOMEWHERE AROUND THERE SCERTAINLY NINE THIRTY M WOULD BE IDEAL BUT TEN A M WOULD BE FINE AS WELL AND THEN YOU HAVE ABOUT ONE HOUR TO GET THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF LEARNING AND EVEN WITHIN THAT ALL TRADEIN CYCLE THIS IS WHERE THERE'S A LOTIC CONFUSION OUT THERE PEOPLE THINK OHALL TRADIAN CYCLES ARE NINETY MINUTES THEREFORE WE SHOULD BE IN OUR PEAK LEVEL OF FOCUS THROUGHOUT THAT NINETY MINUTES IN REALITY MOST PEOPLE TAKE ABOUT TEN OR FIFTEEN MINUTES TO BREAK IN TO A REALLY DEEP TRENCH OF FOCUS AND THEN PERIOTICALLY THROUGHOUT THE NEXT HOUR THEY'LL POP OUT OF THAT FOCUS AVE TO DELIBERATELY REFOCUS THIS IS WHY IF POSSIBLE YOU WANT TO TURN OFF WHY FI CONNECTIONS AND PUT YOUR PHONE IN THE OTHER ROOM OR TURN IT OFF IF YOU DO NEED YOUR PHONE OR WHYFI JUST BE AWARE OF HOW DISTRACTING THOSE THINGS CAN BE TO GETTING INTO A DEEP TRENCH OF FOCUS BUT THE POINT IS THIS THESE NINEYMENUTE CYCLES OCCUR PERIODICALLY THROUGHOUT THE DAY BUT THERE IS GOING TO BE ONE PERIOD EARLY IN THE DAY AND HERE I'M REFERRING TO THIS PERIDAS STARTING AT ABOUT NINE THIRTY OR TEN A M AND THEN LIKELY ANOTHER ONE IN THE MID TOLATE AFTERNOON THAT ARE GOING TO BE IDEAL FOR FOCUS LEARNING AND THAT FOCUS LEARNING BOUT SHOULD IDEALLY HAVE YOU SET YOUR CLOCK A STOP WATCH OR SOMETHING TO MEASURE NINETY MINUTES BUT DO ASSUME THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME GITTER AT THE FRONT END WHERE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS AS DEEPLY AS YOU WOULD LIKE THEN YOU'LL GET ABOUT AN HOUR OF DEEP FOCUS AND THEN YOU REALLY START A TRANSITION OUT OF THESE AL TRADIAN CYCLES HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN THE AFTERNOON I'LL TRADIAN CYCL OCURS WELL JUST AS IN THE MORNING IT OCCURS BECAUSE THERE'S AY BRIEF BUT SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE GLUCUCORTICOID SYSTEM IN THE MID TO LATE AFTERNOON I E WISH I COULD TELL YOU IT'S GOING TO BE TWO P M OR ITS GOING TO BE UM  IT'S GOING TO BE THREE P M THAT'S REALLY GOING TO DEPEND ON THE INDIVIDUAL WHEN YOU AN JEST CAFFINE SOME OF THE OTHER DEMANDS OF YOUR DAY BUT YOU CAN LEARN TO RECOGNIZE WHEN THESE TWO PERIODS FOR OPTIMIZE LEARNING WILL OCCUR AND HERE THE KEY PRINCIPLES WATCH FOR A DAY OR TWO MEANING PAY ATTENTION TO WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR PEAK LEVELS OF PHYSICAL AND MENTAL ENERGY IN THE MORNING THAT IS BETWEEN WAKING AND NOON AND THEN AGAIN BETWEEN NOON AND ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN P M ALTHUGH I'M SURE THAT THERE'RE SOME LATE SHIFTED FOCS THAT WILL EXPERIENCE THEIR PEAK AN FOCUS SOMEWHERE AROUND SIXER CSEVEN P M ESPECIL IF THEY'RE WAKING UP AROUND TEN OR ELEVEN A M AS I KNOW SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE ARE ONCE YOU KNOW WHERE THOSE PEAKS IN FOCUS OCCUR ON YOUR SCHEDULE SET A STOP WATCH FOR ONE ALTRADIAN CYCLE IN THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY THIS EXAMPLE I WAS SAYING NINE THIRTY BUT IF YOU CAN'T HOP ON IT UNTIL TEN THAT'S FINE SET IT FOR NINETY MINUTES CONSIDER THAT BLOCK WHOLLY MEANING RULE OUT ALL OTHER DISTRACTIONS BUT ASSUME THAT WITHIN THAT NINETY MINUTE BLOCK YOU ARE ONLY GOING TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS INTENDSLY FOR ABOUT ONE HOUR AND JUST KNOW THAT THE MOLECULES THAT CONTROL NARROPLASTISY AND THESE THINGS HAVE NAMES AND YES BRAIN DRAVENER TROPHIC FACTOR BEDIENT FAS SO OF THE MOST FAMOUS OF THOSE BUT THERE'RE OTHERS AS WELL IN FACT THE VERY RECEPTORS THAT CONTROL SYNAPTIC STRENGTH THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN NURONS SOME OF THE NARROW TRANSMITTERS AND RMODULATORS INVOLVED INE SANAPTIC PLASTISITY THEY UNDERGO REGULATION BY THESE OLD TRADIAN R CHANGES IN GLUCUCORTICOID AND THEN TRYIN CAPTURE A SECOND ALL TRADIAN LEARNING BLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON AGAIN JUST KNOWING THAT THE FIRST TEN OR FIFTEEN MINUTES CONSIDER ITE MENTAL WARM UP AND THN YOU GET ABOUT AN HOUR IT'S NOT EXACTLY SIXTY MINUTES BUT ABOUT AN HOUR TO MAXIMIZE LEARNING SO FOU'RE TRYING TO LEARN SOMETHING REALLY CAPTURE IT DURING THAT PHASE AS WELL NOW IS THERE A THIRD OPPORTUNITY OR A FOURTH OPPORTUNITY THIS RELATES TO JACKSON'S QUESTION DIRECTLY AND THE SHORT ANSWER IS NOT REALLY YOU' UNLESS YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO REQUIRES VERY LITTLE SLEEP WITHIN THE TWELVE OR SIXTEEN HOURS THAT ONE TENDS TO BE AWAKE DURING THE DAY OR EIGHTEEN HOURS THAT ONE TENS TO BE AWAKE THER'RE REALLY ONLY TWO OF THESE MAJOR PEAKS IN THE GLUCUCORTICOID SYSTEM THAT TRIGGER THE ONSET OF THESE CIRCADIAN CYCLES AGAIN THERE'S THERE'S SORVE A RAMPING UP IN A RAMPING DOWN OF GLUCUCORTICODS THROUGHOUT THE DAY BUT THE REAL KEY HERES TO LEARN WHEN YOU TEND TO BE MOST FOCUST BASED ON YOUR REGULAR SLEEP WAKE CYCL CAFIN AN TAKE EXERCISE ET CETERA AND AGAIN THAT'S GOING TO VARY FROM PERSON TO PERSON AND YOU REALLY ONLY HAVE TWO OPPORTUNITIES ORE TWO AL TRADEAN CYCL LS TO CAPTURE IN ORDER TO GET THE MAXIMUM FOCUS CHALLENGING WORK DONE AH A LEARNING SO FOR SOMEBODY THAT WANTS TO LEARN AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL OR WHO HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO CAPTURE ANOTHER ALTRADEAN CYCLE THE OTHER TIME WHERE THAT TENDS TO OCCUR IS ALSO EARLY DAY SO SOME PEOPLE BY WAKING UP EARLY AND USING STIMULANTS LIKE CAFIAN AND HYDRATION OR SOME BRIEF HIGINTENSITY EXERCISES CAN TRIGGER THAT QUARTIS ALL PULSE TO SHIFT A LITTLE BA EARLIER SO THAT THEY CAN CAPTURE A MORNING WORK BLOCK THAT OCCURS SOMEWHERE LET SAY BETWEEN SIX AND SEVEN THIRTY A M SOLITZINK ABOUT OUR TYPICAL PERSON AT LEAST IN MY EXAMPLE THAT'S WAKING UP AROUND SEVEN A M AND THEN I SAID HAS THEIR FIRST ALLTRADIAN WORK CYCLE REALLY FLIP ON CAUSE THAT BUMPING QARTIS ALL ROUND NINE THIRTY OR TEN A M IF THAT PERSON WERE SAY TO SET THEIR ALARM CLOCK FOR FIVE THIRTY A M THEN GET UP GET SOME ARTIFICIAL LIGHT IF THE SUN ISN'T OUT YOU TURN ON BRIGHT OF ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS OR IF THE SUN HAPPENS TO BE UP THAT TIME OF YEAR GET SOME SUNLIGHT IN YOUR EYES BUT IRRESPECTIVE OF SUNLIGHT WERE TO GET A LITTLE BIT OF BRIEF HIGH INTENSITY EXERCISE MAY BE TEN OR FIFTEEN MINUTES OF SKIPPING ROBE OR EVEN JOS JUMPING JACKS ARE GO OUT FOR BRIEF JOG WHAT HAPPENS THEN IS THE QARTIS ALL PUL STARTS TO SHIFT EARLIER AND SO THEN NEXT DAY IN THE FOLLOWING DAY AND SO ON AND SO FORTH PROVIDED THERE STILL DOING THAT EXERCISE FIRST THING AND IDEALLY GETTING SOME LIGHT IN THEIR EYES AS WELL WELL THEN THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CAPTURE AND INCREASE IN QUARTIS ALL THAT IS NOW SHIFTED FROM ABOUT SEVEN A M TO ABOUT EIGHT THIRTY A M SO THEY CAN CAPTURE AN HOUR OF WORK THERE AND THEN THEY WILL ALSO STILL BE WITHIN THAT RISING PHASE OF QUARTIS ALL IN THE NINE THIRTY TO TEN A M BLOCK THAT LASTS UNTIL ABOUT IL ELEVEN THIRTY OR SO IT MIGHT HAVE LUNCH PERHAPS AFTER LUNCH THEY DO A NON SLEEP DEEP REAST MAY BE THEY DON'T MAY BE OUR NAPPER MAY BE OR NOT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER AND THEN IN THE AFTERNOON AND I WOULD SUSPECT IT WOULD NOW BE IN THE EARLIER AFTERNOON SOME TIME AROUND TWO OR TWO THIRTY WOULD BE TYPICAL ALTHOUGH AGAIN THAT THAT EXACT TIME WILL VERY PERSON A PERSON THEN THEY WOULD WANT A SCHEDULE ANOTHER NINETY MENATE WORK BLOCKS SO THAT'S HOW YOU CAN CAPTURE THREE NOW YOU CAN START TO SEE ALSO WHY CAPTURING FOUR ALTRADEAN WORK BLOCKS WOULD BE EXCEEDINGLY RARE IS JUST NOT TYPICAL THAT PEOPLE ARE AWAKE FOR THAT MUCH OF THE DAY YO EFT TO SLEEP AT SOME POINT AND I SHOULD MENTION THAT IF YOU ARE GOING TO FORCE YOURSELF TO WAKE UP EARLIER ON A CONSISTENT BASIS YOU PROBABLY SHOULD BE TRYING TO GET TO SLEEP A LITTLE BIT EARLIER AS WELL BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST THE QUALITY BUT THE DURATION OF QUALITY SLEEP THAT REALLY MATTERS FOR LEARNING AND I SHOULD ALSO REMIND EVERYBODY THAT THE ACTUAL REWIRING OF NURANS DOES NOT OCCUR DURING ANY FOCUST WORK BLOCK AT ACTUA OCCURS DURING DEEP SLEEP THE FOLLOWING NIGHT AND THE FOLLOWING NIGHT ENDURING NON SLEEP DEEP REAST IS WHY NON SLEEP DEEP REAST CAN EXCELERATE LEARNING BECAUSE IT'S IN STATES OF REST THAT THE ACTUAL CONNECTIONS BETWEEN NER ON STRENGTHEN OR WEEKIN OR NEW NERANS ARE ADDED IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS FOR WHAT WE CALL LEARNING O CASE O ONE OR TWO ALTRADAN WORK K BLOCKS PER DAY IS TYPICAL THREE WOULD BE REALLY EXCEPTIONAL AND FOR WOULD BE EXTRAORDINARY LOOK FOR THEM MEANING LOOK TO SEE WHEN YOU ARE FEELING MOST FOCUS AND ALERT TYPICALLY IN THE PERIOD BEFORE WAKING AND NOON AND TYPICALLY IN THE PERIOD BETWEEN NOON AND BEDTIME GIVEN YOUR STANDARD IN TAKE OF CAFFINE AND EXERCISE AND OTHER LIFE EVENTS PLEASE ALSO REMEMBER THAT EVEN THOUGH IT'S AN ALL TRADIAN NINETY MINUTE WORK BLOCK THE NURL PLASTICITY IS GOING TO BE BEST TRIGGERD WITHIN A SIXTY MINUTE PORTION OF THAT AND THERE'S NO WAY TO KNOW EXACTLY WHEN THAT SIXTY MINUTES BEGINS AND ENDS UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY BEGIN THE WORK BLOCK SO THIS IS REALLY DESIGN TO BE EMPIRICAL YOU NEAT ACTUALLY GO DO THIS WHAT YOU'LL NOTICE AGAIN IS THAT IT'S HARD TO FOCUS AT FIRST THAN YOU'LL DROP INTO A STATE OF FOCUS YOU MAY GET DISTRACTED THAT'S PERFECTLY NORMAL YOU REFOCUS GET BACK INTO TRIGGERING LEARNING THAT'S REALY WHAT YOURE DOING YOU'R TRIGGERING LEARNING AND THEN THEY'LL BE SOME TAPER AND THANYOU'LL BE OUT OF THE ALL TRADEN WORK BLOCK NOW IT'S ALSO KEY TO UNDERSTAND THAT MYSELF ANOTHER PEOPLE SHOULD NOT EXPECT THAT THEY'RE ONLY WORKING DURING THESE NINETY MENUTE WORK BLOCKS IT'S JUST THAT A LOT OF THE  SORTS OF DEMANDS OF OUR DAY INCLUDING YOCOOKING AND CHOPPING VEGOCERY IS AND EMAIL AND TEXMESSAGING AND SO CHAL MEDIA LOT OF THOSE THINGS DON'T REQUIRE INTENSE FOCUS OF THE SORT THAT I BELIEVE JACKSON IS ASKING ABOUT MAXIMISING AND THAT I'M REFERRING TO WHEN I TALK ABOUT THESE ULL TRADEIN WORKBLOCKS AND THEN AS A FINAL POINT I'VE BEE TELL GU ABOUT THESE ALL TRADIAN WORK BLOCKS AND FOCUS ET CETERA IN A CONTEXT THAT BRINGS TO MINE IDEAS ABOUT COGNATIVE WORK SO LEARNING A LANGUAGE LEARNING MATH A WRITING OR CREATING DOING  SOMETHING RELATE TO MUSIC ET CETERA BUT THESE NINETY MENUTE ULL TRADING WORK BLOCKS ALSO DIRECTLY RELATE TO PHYSICAL SKILL LEARNING AS WELL AND TO PHYSICAL EXERCISE AS WELL SO IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHOSE REALLY INTERESTED IN IMPROVING YOUR FITNESS AND YOUR FITNESS REQUIRES LOT OF FOCUS ET TENTION SO FOR INSTANCE WHEN I GO OUT FOR A LONG RUN ON SUNDAYS WHICH IS PART OF MY FITNESS ROUTINE I DELIBERATELY NOT THINKING ABOUT MUCH I'M JUST TRYNG TO CRUISE ALONG I MIGHT FOCAS THE LOBIT ON MY PACE AND STRIDE MAY BE AN AUDIO BOOK O'M LISTENING TO OR A PODCAST BUT TYPICALLY I'M JUST CONT OF CRUISING ALONG IT'S IT'S LOW COGNTIVE DEMAND WORK THESE ALL TRATING WORK BLOCKS CAN REALLY BE MAXIMIZED FOR PURE COGNIVE WORK A BOOK TYPE WORK ET CETERA MUSIC ET CETERA OR THEY CAN ALSO BE LEVERAGE TOWARD SKILL LEARNING SO IF YOUARE TRYING TO LEARN HOW TO DANCE OR HOW TO PERFORM O PARTICULAR ATHLETIC MOVE OR YOU'RE TRYING TO GET BETTER AT SOME SKILL THAT REQUIRES A LOT OF FOCUS AND A LINEMENT OF MUSCULAR MOVEMENT AND COGNATIVE DEMANDS ET CETERA WELL THEN THESE ARE ALSO GOING TOL BE IDEAL FOR TRIGGERING NARRO PLASTISY TO GET BETTER IN THE MOTOR SKILL BASE DOMAIN AS IT'S CALLED ET CETERA IF YOU' LIKE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT UL TRADIAN SHIFTS IN NURRO PLASTICITY AND ALL TREATIIN WORKBOUTS IILL CERTAINLY DO MORE ON THIS IN THE STANDARD HUBERMAN LAD PODCAST B UT THE KEYWARDS TO LOOK UP IF YOU WANT TO EXPLORE THIS FURTHER ON LINE ITS NOT SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT IS CALLED ITERATIVE METAPLASTICITY IT'S A VAST LITERATURE AND ONE THAY BE HAPPY TO TEACH YOU IN A STANDARD PODCAST EPISODE BUT IN THE INTEREST OF GETTING TO MORE QUESTIONS FROM YOU ALL AHOPEFULLY THE ANSWER IVE GIVEN YOU NOW HAS BEEN COMPLETE ENOUGH YET CLEAR ENOUGH AND YET SECINCT ENOUGH THAT YOU CAN START TO LEVERAGE THESE REALLY POWERFUL ASPECTS OF ITERATIVE MIT O PLASTICITY AND ALL TRADIAN RHYTHMS FOR LEARNING AND I JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THESE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FOCUST LEARNING THAT OCCUR IN THESE NINETY MINUTE ULTRADIUM CYCLES ARE REALLY TERRIFIC OPPORTUNITIES THEY ARE OFFERED TO YOU AT LEAST TWICE EVERY DAY AND YOU CAN REALLY LEARN TO DETECT WHEN THEY OCCUR AND WHEN THEY ARE LIKELY TO OCCUR YOU CAN CERTAINLY LEARN AT OTHER TIMES IN THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR CYCLE BUT FOR ANYONE WHOS TRIED TO STAY UP LATE AT NIGHT CRAMMING FOR AN EXAM OR FOR SOMEBODY WHOS TRIED TO LEARN DURING THE SLEEPIEST TIME OF THEIR AFTERNOON WE CAN BE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE FACT THAT THERE ARE TIMES OF DAY IN WHICH WE ARE BEST AT LEARNING AND AS I'VE JUST DESCRIBED THERE ARE WAYS TO CAPTURE THOSE MOMENTS AND THEY ARE VALUABLE MOMENTS SO EVEN THOUGH IT'S JUST ABOUT THREE HOURS PER DAY ARE REALLY ONLY TWO HOURS PERDAY CAUSE OF THE SIXTY NINETY MINUTE THING THAT I TALKED ABOUT A FEW MINUTES AGO LEARN TO KNOW WHEN THESE OCCUR AND REALLY TREAT THEM AS VALUABLE MAYB EVEN WHOLLY IN THE SENSE THAT THEY ARE REALLY THE TIMES THAT ARE OFFERED UP TO YOU EACH DAY BY YOUR OWN BIOLOGY IN WAYS THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO GET BETTER PRETTY MUCH AT ANYTHING THANK YOU OR JOINING FOR THE BEGINNING OF THIS ASK ME ANYTHING EPISODE TO HEAR THE

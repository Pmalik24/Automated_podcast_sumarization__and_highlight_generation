WELCOME TO THE HUBERMEN LPOSCIENCE SCIENCE  TO I MAY INDRU HUBERMEN AND O'M A PROFESSOR OF NEUROMOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COST TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS ATH LETIC GREENS IS AN AL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE POD CAST THE REASEN I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS ON THEREASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIGREENS ONCE OR TWICE TO DAY IS THAT HELPS ME COVER ALL OF MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGHT HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH OUR VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GOP MICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WITH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSENTALLY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITHOUT LETIC GREENS I GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I

DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR AE TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLE OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLITES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AND ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOS ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEMS CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLITES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IF HYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOU'RE GETTING THE PROPARATIOES OF ELECTROLITES IF YOU LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO

DO COM SLASH HUBERMAN THIS MONTH ON THE HUBERMEN LAB PODCAST WERE TA KING ALL ABOUT HORMONES THESE INCREDIBLE CHEMICALS THAT CAN IMPACT OUR MOOD OUR BEHAVIOR OUR FEELINGS OF OPTIMISM OR PESSIMISM THE AMAZING THING ABOUT HORMONES IS THAT HORMONES IMPACT ALL THOSE THINGS BUT ALL THOSE THINGS HOW WE FEEL AND WHAT WE DO AND WHAT WE THINK ALSO CAN IMPACT OUR HORMONES AND SO IT'S A REALLY FASCINATING AREA OF BIOLOGY THAT IMPACTS EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US EVERY DAY BOTH IN WAKEFULNESS AND IN SLEEP AND THROUGHOUT THE LIFE SPAN TO DAY WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKIN ABOUT HORMONE OPTIMIZATION AND WE'RE MAINLY GOING TO BE FOCUSING ON ESTROGEN AND TESTASTRONE AND THEIR DERIVATIVES LAST EPISODE OF THE HUBERMAN LAD PODCAST WE TALKED ABOUT SEXUAL DEVELOPMENT THAT IS HOW THE CROMOZONES THE GONADS AND HORMONES IMPACT WHAT WE CALL SECXUAL DEVELOPMENT LEADING ALL THE WAY UP TO PUBERITY TO DAY WE'RE MAINLY GOING TO TALK ABOUT PROCESSES THAT HAPPEN FROM PUBRITY ONWARD ALTHOUGH WE MIGHT TALK A LITLE IT ABOUT DEVELOPMENT AS WELL SO TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK A LOT ABOUT BASIC BIOLOGY BUT WE'RE GOING TO WEAVEN A LOT OF PRACTICAL TOOLS ALONG THE WAY FOR HOW TO OPTIMIZE THESE INCREDIBLY POWERFUL THINGS THAT WE CALL HORMONES BEFORE WE DIVE INTO OUR DISCUSSION ABOUT HORMONE OPTIMIZATION ONE ARAISE WHAT I THINK IS A VERY IMPORTANT POINT THAT AT LEAST I HADN'T HEARD OF UNTIL RECENTLY WHICH IS THE CONCEPT OF SALUTED GENESIS MANY OF US ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE CONCEPT OF PATHEGENESIS THE IDEA THAT THERE ARE ALL THESE SCARY DISEASES LIKE DEMENSIA AND HEART DISEASE AND STROKE AND ALL THESE THINGS THAT AWAIT US IF WE DON'T TAKE GOOD CARE OF OURSELVES AND THAT MIGHT AWAIT US EVEN IF WE DO THAT'S THE PATHAGENIC MODEL SALUT A GENESIS IS SOMETHING I LEARNED ABOUT FROM ONE OF MY STAMPHORED MEDICINE COLLEAGUES WHICH IS A DIFFERENT ORIENTATION TOWARD HEALTH AND WELL BEING WHERE YOU'RE TAKING ON PARTICULAR BEHAVIORS YOU'RE TAKING ON A PARTICULAR STANCS TOWARDS NUTRICION AND EXERCISE SUPPLEMENTATION ET CETERA IN ORDER TO PROMOTE WELL BEING ABOVE WHERE YOU WOULD BE IF YOU WERE NOT DOING THOSE BEHAVIORS OF YOU THINK ABOUT THERE IS TWO THINGS SALUTAGENESIS AND THE PATHEGENIC MODEL ARE REALLY TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN BUT I'LL JUST GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THIS MIGHT AFFECT YOU IN A REAL WAY IF YOU LIKE EXERCISE BECAUSE IT FEELS GOOD GREAT BUT MANY PEOPLE EXERCISE OR EAT WELL FOR THAT MATTER IN ORDER TO AVOID HEART DISEASE OR TO AVOID DEMENSIA TO AVOID OM YOU KNOW NEGATIVE CHANGES IN BODY COMPOSITION AND WHILE THAT'S POWERFUL AND CERTAINLY IS THE CASE THAT EXERCISE WILL HELP YOU MOVE AWAY FROM ALL THOSE THINGS THE SALUTA GENESIS MODEL DIFFERS IN THAT IT INVOLVES A MINDSETTIN AN ORIENTATION TOWARDS DOING THOSE THINGS IN ORDER TO FEEL GOOD IN ORDER TO ENHANCE YOUR LEVEL OF ENERGY IN ORDER TO IMPROVE ENDEGRANE FUNCTION AND METABOLIC FUNCTION SO IT'S REALLY PART OF THE PATHEGENIC MODEL AND YET SALUT A GENESIS IS REALLY MORE OF A MIND SET TOWARD WHY YOU WOULD DO THESE PARTICULAR BEHAVIORS IN REALLY THE MOST POWERFUL MINDS THAT IS GOING TO BE ONE WHERE YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT THE PATHEGENIC MODEL DOING THINGS SO THAT YOU DON'T AND UP SICK ET CETERA AND TO MOVE AWAY FROM SICNESSS AS WELL AS THE SALUTAGENIC MODEL WERE YOU'RE DOING THINGS IN ORDER TO MOVE TOWARDS HELTH AND WELL BEING WE THINK OF HEALTH AND WELLNESS NOWADAYS ORE THE WELLNESS COMMUNITY OR WELL NESS PRACTICES AND IN MANY WAYS THAT IS THE ESENCE OF THE SALUTOGENIC MODEL BUT I FOUND IT VERY INTERESTING TO KNOW THAT WITHIN THE FIELD OF ALAPATHIC MEDICINE THESE TWO MODELS EXIST BUT WE DON'T HERE ABOUT THE SALUTOGENIC MODEL QUITE AS OFTEN SOGUST SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE MIND SET EFFECTS THAT WERE DISCUSSED IN PREVIOUS EPISODES I'M NOT GOING TO GOING TO THESE IN DETAIL AGAIN RIGHT NOW BUT IF YOU MIGHT RECALL FROM THE EPISODE ON FOOD AND MOOD WE TALKED ABOUT SROM THESE INCREDIBLE STUDIES THAT WERE DONE BY A LEOCRUMS GROUP AT STAMFORD AND OTHERS SHOWING THAT IF YOU TELL PEOPLE THAT THE BEHAVIOR THAT THEYARE ABOUT TO DO IN THIS CASE IT WAS PEOPLE CLEANING UP HOTEL ROUMS AS THAT WAS THEIR JOB IF YOU TELL THEM THAT IT'S GOOD FOR THEM THAND YOU SEE MUCH GREATER POSITIVE HELPH EFFECTS THAN IF THEY AREN'T AWARE OF THAT INFORMATION THAT IT'S GOOD FOR THEM SO WE SHOULD REALLY BE THINKING ABOUT NOT JUST MOVING AWAY FROM DISEASE AND NEGATIVE THINGS BUT ALSO WY SERTAIN THINGS ARE GOOD FOR US BECAUSE IT'S WELL ESTABLISHED NOW FROM REALLY GOOD SCIENTIFIC STUDIES THAT KEEPING IN MIND THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF THINGS CAN REALLY HAVE AN OUTSIZED EFFECT ON WELL BEING RIGHT DOWN TO THE LEVER LEVEL OF OUR PHYSIOLOGY SO LET'S TALK ABOUT HORMONOPTIMIZATION TODAY WE'REGOING TO TALK ABOUT HORMONOPTIMIZATION IN REFERENCE TO ESTROGEN AND TESTOSTERONE AND THEIR DERIVATIVES NOW ESTROGEN AND TESTOSTRON AND THEIR DERIVATIVES ARE WHAT WE CALL SEX STEROIDS NOW THE SEX STEROIDS IMMEDIATELY CALL TO MIND SECS FOR OBVIOUS REASONS AND STEROIDS MEANING ANABOLIC STEROIDS BUT I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT ESTROGEN AND TESTSTRON ARE PRESENT IN EVERYBODY IT'S THEIR RATIOS THAT DETERMINE THEIR EFFECTS SO TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW YOU CAN OPTIMIZE THE RATIOS DEPENDING ON YOUR PARTICULAR LIFE GOLES BECAUSE THE RATIO OF ESTROGEN AND TESTOSTERONE IN EVERY INDIVIDUAL HAS PROFOUND INFLUENTS ON FEELINGS OF WELL BEING FEELINGS OF OPTIMISM FEELINGS OF ANXIETY OR LACK OF ANXIETY ON REPRODUCTION ON SEXUAL BEHAVIOR INDEPENDENT OF REPRODUCTION THEY ARE PROFOUNDLY POWERFUL MOLECULES AND WE ALL MAKE THESE MOLECULES TO SOME DEGREE OR ANOTHER BUT THERE ARE ALSO IMPORTANT BEHAVIORAL TOOLS SUPPLEMENTATION TOOLS AS WELL AS PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT CAN IMPACT THE RATIOS OF TESTOSTRON AND ESTROGEN IN REALLY POWERFUL WAYS SO ORDANTO COVER ALL OF THAT I WANT O EMPHASIZE THAT WHEN YOU HEAR SEX STEROIDS OR STEROID HORMONES MOST PEOPLE THINK ABOUT ANABOLIC STEROIDS AND OF COURSE ANABOLIC STEROIDS OR DERIVITIVES OF TESTOSTERONE OR TESTOSTRON ITSELF AND THEY ARE HEAVILY USED AND ABUSED IN THE SPORTS COMMUNITY AS WELL AS OUTSIDE THE SPORTS COMMUNITY BUT THERE OF COURSE ARE MANY STEROIDS THAT ARE NOT ANABOLIC STORIES THAT ARE ALSO ABUSED IN SPORTS TODAY WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT DRUGS AND SPORTS BUT I THINK THAT IT CARRY SUCH A HEAVY WEIGHT WHEN PEOPLE HEAR THE WORD STEROIDS THEY THINK ABOUT ANABOLIC STEROIDS SO WHILE TO DAY'S DISCUSSION WILL CERTAINLY BE RELEVANT TO PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE IN FACT WORK AN A TALK ABOUT HOW SPECIFIC TYPES OF EXERCISE PARTICULAR PATTERNS OF COLD EXPOSURE AS WELL AS PARTICULAR PATTERNS BELIEVE AR NOT OF BREATHING CAN IMPACT SEXTROID HORMONES BOTH ESTROGEN AND TESTOSTRONE THE DISCUSSION ISN'T REALLY GEAR TOWARDS PERFORMANCE IN HANCMEN IN SPORT ALTHOUGH WE WILL DO AN ENTIRE EPISODE PERHAPSYOU VEN ENTIRE MONTH RELATED TO PERFORMANCE AND HANDSMEN IN PHYSICAL ENTERPRISES SO ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS TO UNDERSTAND IF YOU WANT O OPTIMIZE YOUR HORMONES IS WHERE THEY COME FROM THERE ARE LOT OF DIFERENT GLANDS IN THE BODY THAT PRODUCE HORMONES THERE'S THE PINEO GLAND SOME HORMONES ARE MADE IN THE HYPOTHALYMUS HORMONES ARE MADE BY THE GONADS THE OVERIES OR THE TESTES YOU'VE GOT THE THIROID GLAND THERE ARE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT GLANDS THAT MAKE THESE DIFFERENT HORMONES BUT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SEXTROID HORMONEE ESTROGEN AND TESTOSTRONE THE MAJOR SOURCES ARE OVERIES FOR ESTROGEN AND THE TESTES FOR TESTOSTRONE ALTHOUGH THE ADRINOLS CAN ALSO MAKE TESTOSTRONE NOW THERE ALSO SOME ENZIMES ENZIMES ARE THINGS THAT CAN CHANGE CHEMICAL COMPOSITIEN AND THE ENZIMES THAT WERE GAN O TALK ABOUT TODAY ARE THE EROMATASES MAINLY THE AROMATASES CONVERT TESTSTRONE INTESTROGEN SO IN A MALE FOR INSTANCE THAT HAS VERY HYGH TESTOSTRON SOME OF THAT IS GOING TO BE CONVERTED IN TESTROGEN BY EROMATAS AND AROMATASES MADE BY BODY FACT IS ALSO MADE IN THE TESTES THEMSELVES NOT A PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THIS BUT THE TESTES ACTUALLY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO MANUFACTURE ESTROGEN AND AROMATASES I'LL BE IT AT LOW LEVELS BUT THIS TURNS OUT TO BE IMPORTAN FOR OPTIMIZING HORMONE LEVELS IN MALES AT LATER POINTS AND WILL DISCUSS THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THERE'S A HUGE RANGE IN TERMS OF THE LEVELS OF HORMONES TESTOSTRON IN ESTROGEN BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND IT ACTUALLY OCCURS WITHIN INDIVIDUALS ACROSS THE LIFSPIN I'M NOT EN OUG THROUWGHOUT SPECIFIC NUMBERS OF EXPECOGRAMS FOR DESALEADER ET CETERA TO DAY BECAUSE THAT'S CEN O VERY A LOT IT'S GIN A DEPEND ON WITH NOT YOUR MEASURING IN PECAGRAMS OR NANAGRAMS AND THAT SORT OF THING IF YOU WANT TO EXAMINE YOUR HORMONES YOU SHOULD DO THAT IN CONJUNCTION WITH A MEDICAL DOCTOR IDELIAN AND ER CHRONOLOGISTS CAN HELP YOU SORT OUT THAT INFORMATION BUT THE IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW IS THAT PREPUBESSENT FEMALES MAKE VERY LITTLE ESTROGEN AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ESTROGEN WE MAINLY TALK ABOUT ESTRA DIAL WHICH IS THE MOST ACTIVE FORM OF ESTROGEN IN BOTH MALES AND FEMALES SO PRPUBESAND FEMALES VERY LOW LEVELS OF ESTROGEN DURING PUBERITY LEVELS OF ESTROGEN A K ESTRODILE BASICALLY SCYROCKET AND THEN ACROSS THE LIFE SPAN ESTROGEN IS GOING A VERY DEPENDING ON THE STAGE OF THE MENSTRAL CYCLE BUT AS ONE HEADS INTO MENOPAUS WHICH TYPICALLY TAKES PLACE NOWADAYS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN AGE FORTY FIVE AND SIXTY LEVELS OF ESTROGEN ARE GOING TO DROP AND THEN POSTMEN APOS LEVELS OF ESTROGEN ARE VERY LOW AS WELL TESTOSTRON WILL FLUCTUATE ACROSS THE LIESPAN TESTOSTRONES CAN BE RELATIVELY LOW PREPU PREPUBERTY IN MALES DURING PUBRITY IT'S GON A SCY ROCKET AND THEN THAT TURRENT NUMBERS ARE THAT IT DROS OFF AT ABOUT A RATE OF ONE PERSENT PER YEAR ALTHOUGH WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOME DATA THAT SHOW THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY TREMENDOUS VARIATION TESTOSTRON LEVELS JUSTUALLY LOT OF EXAMPLES OF MEN IN THEIR NINETIES THEI'RE NINETIES WHO STILL HAVE TESTOSTRONE LEVELS THAT MIMIC PUBERTAL LEVELS WHICH IS REMARKABLE AND SPEAKS TO THE HUGE VARIATION AN TESTOTRONE LEVELS ACROSS INDIVIDUALS SO LET'S TALK ABOUT OTHER SOURCES OF THESE HORMONES AND THEN IT WILL MAKE CLEAR WHUT AVENUES YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE THESE HORMONES THE OTHER GLANDS AND TISSUES IN THE BODY THAT MAKE THESE HORMONS TESTOSTRN AND ESTROGEN AS I MENTION BRIEFLY ARE THE ADRINALS SO THE ADRENALS RIDEA TOP THE KIDNEYS AND THE RELEASE OF THES STEROID HARMONS FROM THE ADDRENALS IN PARTICULAR TESTOSTRON AND SOME OF ITS RELATED A DERIVITIVES ARE MAINLY ACTIVATED BY COMPETITION SO LET'S TALK ABOUT COMPETITION BECAUSE IT TURNS IT OUT THAT COMPETITION IS A POWERFUL INFLUENCE ONE THE SEXTRORID HORMONES AND THE SEXTROID HARMONS POWERFULLY INFLUENCE COMPETITION SOMOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THIS BUT MOST MALES OF A GIVEN MAMALIAN SPECIES NEVER GET TO REPRODUCE IN FACT THEY NEVER EVEN GET TO HAVE SECTS AT ALL AND WE DON'T OFTEN THINK ABOUT THAT BUT TESTOSTERONE PLAYS A POWERFUL ROLL IND DETERMINING WHICH MEMBERS OF A GIVEN SPECIES WILL GET TO REPRODUCE WHICH ONES OF THAT SPECIES THAT WILL ACTUALLY GET ACCESS TO FEMALES AND SO HERE I'M NOT TALK ABOUT HUMAN SPECIFICALLY BUT IT'S WELL KNOWN IN SPECIES LIKE ELEPHANT SEALS IN SPECIES LIKE ANT LERED ANIMALS AND RAMS FOR INSTANCE THAT THE HIGHER LEVELS OF TESTOSTRONE CORRELATE WITH ACCESS TO FEMALES NOW ONE INTERPRETATION OF THIS IS THAT THE FEMALES ARE DETECTING WHICH MALES HAVE HIGH TESTOSTRONE AND SELECTING THEM THEY'RE MORE RECEPTIVE TO THEM WERE GAN A TALK ABOUT RECEPTIVITY FOR MATING IN A MOMENT BUT IT'S ACTUALLY MORE SO THAT THE MALES THAT HAVE HIGHER TESTOSTRON FORAGE FURTHER AND WILL FIGHT HARDER FOR THE FEMALES AND THIS IS REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE THERE'S VERY GOOD EVIDENCE NOW THAT TESTOSTRONE CAN REDUCE ANXIETY PROMOTE NOVELTY SEEKING AND PROMOTE COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS AND SO BEFORE YOU LEAP TOO FAR WITH THIS IN YOUR MIND AND THINK ABOUT ALL THESE HUMAN BEHAVIORS JUST STAY WITH MECAUSE THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF BIOLOGY HERE THAT MAKES IT ALL MAKE SENSE AND IT TURNS OUT TO BE PRETTY SIMPLE WE HAVE A BRAIN REGION CALL THE EMIGDULA IN LATIN THAT JUST MEANS ALMON BUT THE IMIGULA'S MOST FAMOUS FOR ITS ROLE IN FEAR WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT FEAR AND THE EMIGDULA BUT THAT THE IMIGULAS REALLY INVOLVED IN THREAT DETECTION IT SETS ARE THRESHOLDS FOR ANXIETY AND WHAT WE CONSIDER SCARY OR TOO MUCH TESTOSTRONE SECRETED FROM THE GONADS AND ELSEWHERE IN THE BODY BIND TS TO THE IMIGDULA AND CHANGES THE THRESHOLD FOR STRESS SO I'VE SAID BEFORE ON PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF THIS PODCAST AND ON OTHER PODCAS THAT TESTOSTRONE HAS THIS INCREDIBLE EFFECT OF MAKING EFFORT FEEL GOOD BUT WHAT I WAS REALLY REFERRING TO IS THE FACT THAT TESTOSTRONE LOWER STRESS AND ANXIETY IN PARTICULAR IN MALES OF A GIVEN SPECIES NOW THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE OFTEN THINK OF TESTOSTRON AS CREATING WHATEVER MASCULINIZATION OR ITS YOU KNOW VIRALIZATION OR ALL THESE THESE TERMS ARE THROWN AROUND BUT WHAT'S IT REALLY DOING WHEN IT COMES TO MAKE CHOICE AND COMPETITION WHAT ITS DOING IS ITS REDUCING THE THRESHOLD FOR ANXIETY AND INDOING SO IT SELECTS INDIVIDUALS OF A GIVEN SPECIES TO PUSH FURTHER BEEN WILLING TO YOU KNOW SUFFER MORE OM ALTHOUGH IT ALSO RODUCES PAIN SO MAVE THEY ALSO SUFFER LESS IN PURSUIT OF REPRODUCTION AND FEMALES NOW IT'S WELL KNOWN IN HUMANS THAT BOTH MALES AND FEMALES WHO HAVE ELEVATED LEVELS OF TESTOSTRON WILL ENGAGE IN MORE NOVELTY SEEKING AND I DO WANT A POINT OUT THAT EVEN INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT TESTIES HAVE TESTOSTRON AND PIKES IN TESTSTRON HAVE SIMILAR EFFECTS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT SOME ONE HAS OVERIES OR TESTIES TESTOSTRON INCREASES GENERALLY LEAD TO MORE FORAGING MORE NOVELTY SEEKING INCREASES IN LABIDO AND INCRECES IN DESIRE TO MATE SO IT IS THE CASE THAT INCREASES IN TESTOSTRON PROMOTE COMPETITIVE AND FORGING TYPE BEHAVIORS IN IN HUMANS AND IN NONHUMAN MAMELS BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT COMPETITION ITSELF CAN INCREASE ANDROGEN SUCH AS TESTOSTRON AND REPEAT THAT COMPETITIVE INVIRONMENTS THEMSELVES CAN INCREASE TESTOSTRO NOW SOMEPEOPLE HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IF YOU WIN YOUR TESTOSTRON GOES UP AND IF YOU LOSE YOUR TESTOSTRON GOES DOWN AND TOSOME EXTENT THAT'S TRUE BUT THAT'S NOT A DIRECT EFFECT ON THE GONADS THAT'SASHI MEDIATED BY THE NOROMODULATOR DOPOMIE WE TALKED ABOUT DOPOMINE IN THE EPISODE ON MOTIVATION IN DRIVE AND DOPOMINE IN TESTOSTRONE HAVE A REMARKABLE INTERPLAY IN THE BODY DOPAMNE IS ACTUALLY RELEASED IN THE BRAIN IN WAYS THAT HAS THE PETUITARY THIS GLAND THAT SITS OVER THE ROOF OR YOUR MOUTH RELEASE CERTAIN HORMONES THAT THEN GO ON TO PROMOTE THE RELEASE OF MORE TESTOSTRON AND INDEED WINNING PROMOTES MORE DOPOMINE AND LATER MORE TESTOSTRON HOWEVER IN THE SHORT TERM JUST COMPETING INCRESES TESTOSTRONE INDEPENDENT ON WHETHER OR NOT YOU WIN OR LOSE SO THE SHORTVERSION OF THIS IS THAT COMPETITION INCREASES TESTOSTRO AND THIS MAY BE IN ANCIENT MECHANISM WHEREBY THE ANDROGEN SUCH AS TESTOSTRN ARE FEEDING BACK TO ENCOURAGE MORE COMPETITIVE TYPE BEHAVIORS BECAUSE EVERY SPECIES WHETHER NOT YOUR TIME OUT REPRODUCTION WER OTHER RESORCEALICATION IS INVOLVED IN COMPETITION NOT EVERY INDIVIDUAL OF A SPECIES GETS ACCESS TO THE SAME NUMBER OF MATES OR THE SAME QUALITY OF MATES AND THIS IS TRUE IN BOTH DIRECTIONS FOR MALES AND FEMALES AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN SO JUST ONE TO EMPHASIZE ONCE MORE IN CASE I WENT THROUGH IT TOO QUICKLY THAT INCREASES IN TESTOSTERONE IN FEMALES ARE ALSO GOING TO LEAD TO INCREASE IN REPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOR SEEKING OUT REPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOR THEY INCREASE LIBIDO IN FACT THERE IS A PARTICULAR PHASE OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE WERE TESTOSTERONE PEAKS JUST BEFORE OVULATION THAT ON AVERAGE LEADS FEMALE HUMANS TO SEEK OUT SECS MORE THAN THEY WOULD OTHERWISE DURING THEIR CYCLE AND THIS IS ALL BY SELF REPORT BUT THIS IS ALSO WHILE MEASURING THINGS LIKE TESTOSTERONE ESTROGEN RATIOS AND SO FORTH SO ITS REALLY INTERESTING THAT A SINGLE MOLECULE REGARDLESS OF CROMOSOMO OR GONATO BACKGROUND IS INCREASING SEEKING OF MATES A CROSS INDIVIDUALS INCREASING DESIRE TO COMPETE OR WILLINGNESS TO COMPETE AND LOWERING THE THRESHOLD FOR STRAS AND ANXIETY ITS IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT WHILE INCREASES IN TESTOSTERONE PROMOTE SEEKING OF MATES AND REPRODUCTION IN BOTH MALES AND FEMALES IN FEMALES ITS ACTUALLY INCREASES IN ESTROGEN THAT PROMOTE RECEPTIVITY TO MADEN SO TESTOSTRON IS DRIVING THE SEEKING OF SEX AND ESTROGEN IS PROMOTING THE ACTUAL ACT OF SECTS FROM FEMALE SO CALLED RECEPTIVITY CONCENTUAL RECEPTIVITY IN MALES ITS INTERESTING TO POINT OUT THE TESTOSTRONE IS PROMOTING SEEKING OF SEX BUT ITS ALSO ESTROGEN IN MALES THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR LIBIDO IF ESTROGEN LEVELS ARE BROUGHT TOO LOW THEN MEN WILL COMPLETELY LOSE THEIR LIBIDO THIS IS OFTEN NOT TOSTOSTER OVERLOOKED IN THE DISCUSSION ABOUT TESTOSTRON THEROPY AND PERFORMANCE IN HANCING DRUGS PEOPLE THINK THAT HYPER ANDROGENIZED INDIVIDUALS MANING PEOPLE TO HAVE VERY HIGH LEVELS OF ANDROGEN WILL HAVE VERY HIGH LEVELS OF LIBIDO AND THEY WILL PROVIDED ESTROGEN IS AVAILABLE IN SUFFICIENT RATIOS TO MATCH THAT TESTOSTRON SO ITS NOS SIMPLY THE CASE THAT HIGH LEVELS OF TESTOSTERONE PRODUCE A LOT OF SEXA MATING BEHAVIOR AND LOW LEVELS OF ESTROGEN ARE GOOD ACROSS THE BORD U ACTUALLY NEED BOTH IN BOTH MALES AN FEMALES ITS JUST THAT IN FEMALES THE TESTOSTRON LEVELS ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE LOWER THAN THE ESTROGEN LEVELS AND IN MALES THE ESTROGEN LEVELS ARE ALWAYS CAN BE LOWER THAN TESTOSTRONE LEVELS SO TESTOSTRON PROMOTES SEX SEEKING BEHAVIOR AND THE REAL QUESTION THEN IS THE SEX ITSELF PROMOTE TESTOSTRON AND THE ANSWER IS SOMEWHAT COMPLICATED BUT THE SHORT VERSIEN IS YES AND AS YOU RECALL SEX HAS MULTIPLE STAGES SO THEREIS THE PHYSICAL ACT OF SECS THEREIS THE SEEKING OF SEX AND THEN THEIRS ORGASM AN EJACULATION NOW ITS IMPORTANT TI DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THESE BECAUSE WHETHER OR NOT SEXS ITSELF INCREASES TESTOSTERONE DEPENDS ON WHETHER OR NOT THE MALE EJACULATES AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND BECAUSE ON A PREVIOUS EPISODE I MENTION HOW DOBOMINE INCREASES WITH SEXUALA CTIVITY REMEMBER DOPEMING IN TESTOSTRONE TEND TO INCREASE LINEARILY WITH ONE ANOTHER BUT THEN AFTER EJACULATION THERE IS A RELEASE OF PROLACT AND IN PROLACED AN ACTUALLY SETS THE REFRACTORY PERIOD IN MALES DURING WHICH HE CAN'T HAVE SEX AGAIN AND THE DURATION OF THE REFRACTORY PERIOD WILL VERY TREMENDOUSLY DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH AND HOW LONG THAT PROLACT AN RELEASE OCCURS I ALSO DESCRIBED IN A PREVIOUS EPISODE HOW SOME PEOPLE TAKE VITEM AND BE SEX ON NOT SUGGESSN ANYONE DO THIS BUT TAKE VITEM AND BE SIX IN ORDER TO REDUCE PROLACT IN LEVELS AND THEREBY REDUCED THE DURATION OF THE REFRACTORY PERIOD BUT GETTING AT THIS QUESTION ABOUT TESTOSTRONE AND SEXTUAL BEHAVIOR IT'S IMPORTANT TO DISTINGUISHE BETWEEN THESE DIFFERENT PHASES OF REPRODUCTION OR REPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIORS SO THERE ARE STUDY SHOWING THAT SEXUAL BEHAVIOR ITSELF CAN INCREASE TESTOSTRONE THERE WAS A STUDY PULPSHION TWO THAS AN ELEVEN FROM ESTOSA AT ALL E S C A S A THIS IS THE STUFF OF TEXBOXES IS ON POBMED THESE ARE QUALITY STUDIES SHOWING THAT MEN WHO OBSERVE SEX SO I GESS THIS WOULD BE OBSERVING PORNOGRAPHY WILL HAVE SLIGHT INCREASES IN TESTSTRONE DURING THE OBSERVATION THESE YULACTUAY WERE WERE WILLING TO HAVE BLOOD DRAWS TAKEN WHILE WATCHING PORNOGRAPHY THEY HAD INCREASES IN TESTSTROE THAT WERE VERY MODEST OF ABOUT TEN PER SENT WHEREAS WHEN PEOPLE PARTICIPATED IN SEC THEY ACTUALLY DID THIS STUDY WHERE PEOPLE HAD BLOOD DRAWS AND THEY HAD REAL SEC WITH THEIR PARTNERS AND THEY HAD SEVENTY PER CENT INCREASES IN TOSTOSTRONE SO THERE ARE INCREASES IN TESTOSTRONE THAT ARE QUITE SIGNIFICAN DURING THE PHYSICAL ACT OF SEC AND FAR LESS SO DURING OBSERVING SEC NOW THE QUESTION THAT I OFTEN GET IN FACT AS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS HIT GET MOST OPEN IN THE COMMENTS ON YOU DO I DON'T KNOW WHY THAT IS IS WHETHER OR NOT EJACULATION A JUST TESTOSTRONE LEVELS AND IT TURNS OUT THERE TWO STUDIES THAT I COULD FIND THAT WERE QUALITY STUDIES ON POMED THAT ADDRESS THIS THAT SEXON EJACULATION ITSELF DOES NOT REDUCE TOSTSTRONE LEVELS ALTHOUGH IT WILL INCREASE PROLACTIN LEVELS FOR THE REASONS THI DESCRIBED A MOMENT AGO HOWEVER ABSTINENCE WOR SEX WITHOUT EJACULATION FOR A WEAK OR MORE WILL INCREASE TESTOSTRONE LEVELS UP TO FOUR HUNDRED PER SENT SO THE ANSWER IS ACTUALLY COMPLICATED IT'S NOT STRAIGHTFORWARD WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT SEX ITSELF INCREASES TESTOSTRONE HOWEVER ABSTINENCE ALSO INCREASES TESTOSTRONE EVEN FURTHER SO ITS A NEUW WANTS ANSWER AND I HOPE THIS IS SATISFACTORY NOPON INTENDED TO THOSE OF YOU THAT HAVE BEEN ASKING ME WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SEXON EJACULATION IN TOSTOSTRONE AND DOPOMIN IT IS NUWWANTS AND YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT NEW ANTS IF YOU WANT UNDERSTAND HOW CERTAIN BEHAVIORS IMPACT HORMONES AND HOW HORMONES IMPACT THOSE BEHAVIORS AS I MENTION BEFORE IN FEMALES TESTOSTRONE ALSO PRIMES THE MOTIVATION TO SEEK OUT SEC AND SEXS ITSELF ALSO INCREASES TESTOSTERON BUT IT ALSO INCREASES PROLACTIN SO IN BOTH MEN AND WOMEN SEC INCREASES PROLACTIN POST SEX IT'S JUST THE WAY THAT THE SYSTEM WORKS ITS THAT TESTOSTRONE AND DOPOM IN INCREASE IN THE SEEKING OUT AND THE BEHAVIOR OF SEXS AND THAN AFTER SEX PROLACTIN LEVELS GO UP THERE'S KIND OF A QUIESCENCE THE WHOLE NERVOUS SYSTEM IS PROMOTED TOWARDS CALM AND THIS MAY ACTUALLY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH PERBONDING AND THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF INDIVIDUALS TO SPEND MORE TIME TOGETHER TO EXCHANGE DIFFERENT SMELLS AND HORMONS AND MAY BE EVEN FARMONES WHERE YOU TALK ABOUT FERMONES IN A MOMENT A FEW YEARS AGO THERE WAS A LOT OF EXCITEMENT ABOUT THE HORMONE D H E A WHICH IS MAINLY MADE BY THE ADRENALS D  C A HAS BEEN PROMOTED AS KIND OF A CACHALL FOR INCREASING TESTOSTRONE IN ESTROGEN IN MALES AND FEMALES AND INDEED D  C A WILL INCREASE BOTH TESTOSTRON AND ESTROGEN THIS IS SOMETHING BE MINDFUL OF IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT TAKING D   A OR YOUR TAKING D H   A ALREADY D  C A WILL INCREASE BOTH TESTOSTRON AND ESTROGEN AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT INCREASES ONE OR THE OTHER WILL DEPEND ON WHETHER NOT YOUR STARTING OFF WITH MORE ESTROGEN THAN TESTOSTERON OR WHETHER NOT YOU STARTING OUT FOR THE MORE TESTOSTERON THAN ESTROGEN AND WHETHER NOT YOU HVE A LOT OF OROMATACE SO FOR INDIVIDUALS TAT HAVE A LOT OF A ROMATASE BEING MADE BY THE TESTIES OR A BODY FACT IF YOU TAKE D  C A THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT A FAIR PORTION OF THAT AS CAN BE SHUTTLED TOWARDS ESTROGEN PRODUCTION AND NOT TOWARDS TESTOSTERON PRODUCTION WHEREAS IN INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE LOW LEVELS OF TESTOSTRONE TO BEGIN WITH HIGH LEVELS OF ESTROGEN THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT THE D   IS GOING TO PROMOTE MAINLY ESTROGEN PRODUCTION LEAST THAT'S WHAT I COULD FIND FROM THE RESEARCH STUDIES THAT I EXAMINED SO THE WAY TO THING ABOUT D  C A IT'S A KIND OF GLOBAL A PROMOTER OF THE SEXTROID HORMONES AND ITS SPECIFIC EFFECTS ARE GOING TOAND A LITTLE BIT ON WHERE YOU STARTEN WHEN THEY ARE NOT YOU HAVE OVERES OR TESTIES SO JUST AS THERE ARE BEHAVIORS THAT CAN INCREASE TESTOSTERON THEIR BEHAVIORS THAT CAN DECREASE TESTOSTERONE AND ONE OF THE MOST WELL CHARACTERIZED ONES INHUMANS IS BECOMING APPARENT SO EXPECTING FATHERS HAVE IN ALMOST FIFTY PER CENT DECREASE IN TESTOSTERON LEVELS BOTH FREE AND BOUND TESTOSTERON AS WELL THEIR CORTISAL LEVELS A STRESTHORMONE DROP BY ALMOST THREFOL WHICH IS INCREDIBL AND THEIR ESTRODILE LEVELS DOUBL SO THERE ESTROGEN LEVELS DOUBEL SO EXPECTING FATHERS MANY PEOPLE HAVE KNOWN PUT ON ADDITIONAL BODY WA EVER ONE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT IT'S BECAUSE THEIR EATING IN PARALLEL WITH THEIR PREGNANT WIFE BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT THESE EFFECTS OF REDUCE TESTOSTRON INCREASE ESTRODIL AND REDUCE CORTIZAL CAN ALL BE EXPLAINED BY N INCREASE IN PROLACTIN SO NOT JUST IN HUMANS BUT IN OTHER SPECIES IS WELL WHEND THE MALE AND FEMALE THAT SPECIES ARE EXPECTING YOUNG THEY LAY DOWN MORE BODY FAT THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT THIS IS TO PREPARE FOR LONG NIGHTS OF NO SLEEP WHICH OCCURS IN MANY SPECIES NOT JUST IN HUMANS THOT'S REALLY INTERESTING THAT THIS HORMON PROLACTIN CAN START SUPPRESSING WHOLE CATEGORIES OF HORMON SEXTROID HORMONES AND CAN START INCREASING WHOLE CATEGORIES OF OTHER ONES SO WE HEARE ABOUT THE DAD BOD THEIR LOT OF EXPLANATIONS FOR THE DADBOD UM THAT EXTEND WELL BEYOND THIS PODCAST EPISODE BUT IT IS A WELL KNOWN PHENOMENON THAT TESTOSTRON IS GUN A DROP PROLACTONS CAN INCREASE ESTRADILES CAN INCREASE IN MALES AND FEMALES THAT ARE EXPECTING CHILDREN NOW HOW LONG THAT LASS IS VERY INTERESTING ACTUALLY HAS TO DO WITH HOW MUCH CONTACT AND HOW MUCH CONTACT WITH THE SMELLS OF THE BABY OF THE OFFSPRING THE FATHER HAPPENS TO HAVE SO HOW AVAILABLE OR UNAVAILABLE HE IS WILL ACTUALLY IMPACT HIS LEVEL OF HORMONS NOW I AM DEFILY NOT PROMOTING THE IDEA THAT FATHERS OR MOTHERS TAKE TIME AWAY FROM THEIR OFFSPRING IN ORDER TO KEEP THEIR TESTSTRONE LEVELS HIGHOR TO RESTORE THEM NOT ON I' SAYING AT ALL IT'S JUST INTERESTING TO POINT OUT THAT THESE EVOLUTIONARY MECHANISMS PUSHAS TOWARD OR BIASIS TOWARD PARTICULAR CATEGORIES OF BEHAVIORS BY INFLUENCING OUR HORMONES WHICH THEN FEED BACK AND PROMOTE MORE OF THAT PARTICULAR BEHAVIOR BECAUSE AS I MENTION BEFORE PEAKS AND TESTAOSTRONE IN MALES AND FEMALES CAUSE INDIVIDUALS TO SEEK SEX NOT PROMOTE PARENTING WHEREAS REDUCTIONS IN TESTOSTRONE INCREASES IN PROLACTAN AND DECREASES IN CORTUS ALL MOVE INDIVIDUALS OF BOTH SEXES TORD PARENTING BEHAVIOR AND LESS TOWARD REPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOR THE OTHER BEHAVIOR THAT MARKEDLY REDUCES TESTOSTRONE IN BOTH MALES AND FEMALES AND MARKEDLY REDUCES THE DESIRE FOR SEEKING SEX AND SEX ITSELF IS ILLNESS AND MANY OF YOU MIGHT SAY WELL DO WHEN PEOPLE FEEL SICK THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE SEEKING OUT MATES THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE HAVING SEX BUT HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHY THAT ACTUALLY IS WHAT TURNS OUT THAT IT CAN BE EXPLAINED BY THE RELEASE OF WHAT ARE CALLED IN FLAMMATORY SIDAKINDS SO SIDAKHINDS ARE RELATED TO THE IMUNE SYSTEM THEY TRAVEL IN THE LIMPHON IN THE BLOOD AND THEY ATTACK INVADOR CELLS LIKE BACTERIAN VIRASES AND UNDER CONDITIONS OF ILLNESS WE MAKE A LOT OF DIFFERENT SIDAKINDS SOME OF THEM ARE ANTI IN FLAMMATORY BUT SOME OF THEM ARE PRO IN FLAMMATORY AND THE BEST KNOWN EXAMPLE OF AR PRO INFLAMMATORY SIDAKINE IS ILE SEX AND IT'S KNOWN THAT ILE SIX WHEN INJECTED INTO INDIVIDUALS WILL DECREASE THE DESIRE FOR SEXC AND EVENTUALLY WILL REDUCE LEVELS OF TESTOSTRONE AND ESTROGEN INDEPENDENT OF FEELING LOUSY SO THE REASON WHY PEOPLE DON'T WANT SEX WHEN THEYARE SIC IS BECAUSE LEVELS OF ISLE SEX ARE INCREASE NOW THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS WE START TO THINK ABOUT THE DIFFERENT WAYS TO MODULATE THE SEX STORID HORMONES SO CALL OPTIMIZE THE HORMONES KEEPING LEVELS OF ISLE SEX LO IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO EXERT THEIR EFFEC NOW ILE SEX OSN JUST TRAVEL TO THE GONADS AND SHUT DOWN THE GONADS IT ACTUALLY HAS WAYS TO INTERACT WITH SOME OF THE RECEPTERS THAT THE STEROID HORMONES ESTROGEN INTO SOSTROM BIND TO AND IMPACT THOSE RECEPTORS SO THAT THE SEXTROID HORMONS CAN'T HAVE THEIR EFFECT IN SHORT AND PUT SIMPLY IN FLAMATORY SIDACINES LIKE ILE SIX ARE BAD FOR SEXTORID HORMONES AND SO ORGAN TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO MODULAT ISLE SEXS IN THE DIRECTION THAT YOU WOULD WANT AND HOW TO INCREASE ANOTHER SIDE A KIND CALLED ILE TEN WHICH IS ANTI IN FLAMATORY IN WAYS THAT CAN HELP PROMOTE OR AT LEAST SUPPORT THE SEXTORED HORMONES SO AS WE MOVE FORWARD WERE GOING TO NOW START TO CONSIDER WHAT SORTS OF BEHAVIORAL PRACTICES AS WELL AS OTHER THINGS CAN MODULATE THE SEXTORID HORMONES IN THE DIRECTIONS THAT YOU WANT THEM TO GO BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT AND IN ORDER TO STET THE STAGE FOR THAT YOU SHOULD BE ASKING YOURSELF HOW IS IT OR WHY IS IT AT A MECHANISTIC LEVEL THAT BEHAVIORS CAN MODULATE HORMONES AT ALL IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IT'S KIND OF STRANGE THAT JUST THE MERE ACT OF BEING APPARENT OR PARENTING CAN CHANGE TO STOSTRONE LEVEL SO DRAMATICALLY OR ESTRADIL LEVELS SO DRAMATICALLY WHAT IS IT IS IT THE SWEAT OF THE BAB IS IT THEIR SALIVA IS IT THE SIHT OF THE BABY IS IT HOLDING THE BABY OR IS IT ALL THOSE THINGS IT TURNS OUT THAT MANY OF THOSE EFFECTS ARE BECAUSE OF SMELL OR IN SOME CASES EVEN POSSIBLY FERMONES NOW TALK ABOUT HORMONES HORMONES AGAIN OUR CHEMICAL TRAVELS IN THE BODY IMPACTS TISSUES THEMSELVES ELVES WHERE IN THE BODY A FERMON IS A CHEMICAL THAT'S RELEASED BY ONE MEMBER OF A SPECIES THAT GOES AND IMPACTS MEMBERS ELSEWHERE BUT OF THE SAME SPECIES OR EVEN OF OTHER SPECIES NOW FERMON EFFECTS ARE ABSOLUTELY WELL ESTABLISHED IN LOTS OF ANIMAL SPECIES BUT THEY ARE VERY CONTROVERSIAL IN HUMANS TO DAY I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE WELL ESTABLISH ONES IN ANIMALS I'VE MENTION ONE OR TWO OF THESE BEFORE ON PREVIOUS PODCASS BUT HAVEN'T MENTIONED SEVERAL OF THEM AND I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE EVIDENCE FOR FAIRMONES AN HUMANS THAT ARE WELL ESTABLISHED SO THE MAIN ONES AND ANIMALS THAT ARE DISCUSSED ARE CALLED THE LEBOOTS EFFECT THE WITNAN EFFECT THE BRUCIFFECT IN THE VANDANBURG EFFECT NAMED AFTER THE PEOPLE THAT DISCOVERED THEM THE LEBOOT EFFECT IS WHEN YOU HOWSE FEMALES OF A GIVEN SPECIES TOGETHER WITH NO MALES THEY START DISPLAYING LONGER WHAT ARE CALLED ESTRA CYCLES IN MANY SPECIES THEY DON'T HAV MENSTRAL CYCLS WHICH ARE TWENTY EIGHT DAYS THEY HAVE ESTRA CYCLS WHICH CAN BE FOUR DAYS OR SOME VARIANT THEREOF IT'S AN INTERESTING PHENOMENON BECAUSE WHAT IT MEANS S THAT THE PRESENCE OF THE MALE ITSELF IS CHANGING THE OVULATION CYCL NOW MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE MAGINE MOSTLY THE PEOPLE THAT ARE OVULATING OUT THERE WILL SAY OF COURSE I NOTICE IOVULATE DIFFERENTLY OR MY CYCL CHANGES WHEN I'M IN THE PRESENCE OF MY PARTNER OR I'M NOT BUT THE FERMON EFFECT THAT MIRRORS THIS LEBOOT EFFECT IN HUMANS HAS STILL NOT REALLY BEEN IDENTIFY NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THE EXACT CHEMICAL IS BUT NONE THE LESS THIS IS A STRONG EFFECT IN SOME ANIMALS THE OTHER ONE IS THE BRUSE EFFECT AND THIS IS A VERY DRAMATIC EFFECT WHEREBY APPREGNANT ANIMAL WILL ABORT OR REABSORB HER FEDAS IF THE DAD OF THOSE ANIMALS THE THE FATHER THAT SIRED THE LITTER OR CAUSE THESE ARE ANIMALS THEIR LITTERS IS REMOVED AND A NOVEL MALE IS PLACED IN HER VICINITY FOR ABOUT FORTY EIGHT HOURS AND WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THE WAY THAT THIS HAPPENS IS A FAERMONE THAT COMES FROM MALE URINE ACTIVATES THE GANATATROPE AND RELEASING HORMONE SYSTEM AND CAUSES A REINTRODUCTION OF THE ESTRACYCLE AND A SPONTANEOUS ABORTION OF THE PEDUS NOW LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE TAKKEN THE BRUSE EFFECT KIND OF TO ITS EXTREME AND ASKED WHETHER NOT INHUMANS MISCARRIAGES ARE CAUSED BY DETECTING THE FERMONES OR ODORS OF NOVEL MALES MEANING THE NON DAD MALE ND THAT STILL AN OPEN QUESTION NOBODY KNOWS IF THATS TRUE OR NOT SO ONE EMPHASIZED THAT THE OTHER ONE IS THE VANDONBERG EFFECT AND THIS IS ONE I ALLUDED TO IN A PREVIOUS EPISODEOF THE PODCAST WHICH IS THAT PUBERTY IN FEMALES CAN BE ACCELERATED BY PLACING A NOVEL SECTUALLY COMPETENT MALE IN WITH A YOUNG FEMALE WHO HAS NOT UNDERGONE PUBERTY THERE'S ALSO AVERSION OF THIS WHICH I HAVEN'T DESCRIBED WHICH IS DELAY OF PUBERTY WHERE YOU TAKE JUVENILE FEMALE ANIMALS THAT HAVE NOT UNDERGONE PUBERTY AND YOU PUT THEM WITH MORE MATURE FEMALES OF THE SAME SPECIES AND THAT INTRODUCTION OF MORE FEMALES WILL CAUSE A DELAY A SIGNIFICANT DELAY IN THE ONE SET OF PUBERTY SO THESE ARE ALL FAERMON EFFECTS AND WE KNOW THEIR FAERMON EFFECTS BECAUSE THERE NOT CONSCIOUS THERE ALSO DON'T REQUIRE ACTUAL CONTACT WITH THE OTHER MEMBERS OF A GIVEN SPECIES THESE ARE ALL EFFECTS THAT CAN BE MEDIATED BY THE URINE FROM A GIVEN SPECIES ORE BY THE SWEAT OF A GIVEN SPECIES AND SPEAKING OF SWEAT THE ONE FARMON EFFECT THAT IM VERY AWARE OF FROM THE PUBLISHED LITERATURE IS A PAPER THAT WAS A PUBLISHIN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT BY STERN AN MC LINTOCK WHICH WAS GETTING AT THIS QUESTION OF CYNCHRANIZATION OF MENSTRUAL CYCLES NOW THE WHOLE IDEA OF SYNCRNIZATION OF MENSTRUAL CYCLES IS PRETTY CONTROVERSIAL FOR A LONG TIME PEOPLES THAT O THIS IS ABSOLUTELY A WELL CHARACTERIZED PHENOMENON PEOPLE LIVING IN DORMITORIES THEIR S OF THEIR MENSTRUAL CYCLES WOULD SYNCRANIZE PEOPLE LIVING IN ENVIRONMENTS TOGETHER WITH THEIR MENSTRUAL CYCLES WOULD SYNCRANIZED AND THEN SOME STUDIES CAME OUT THAT KIND OF UNDERCUT THOSE DATA AND SAID NO THIS ACTULY DOESN'T HAPPEN AND IT WAS KIND OF CONTROVERSIAL BUT THERE IS A VERY CLEAR EFFACT THAT WAS DESCRIBED BY STERN MC LINTOC WHAT THEY DID ACTUALLY WAS THEY TOOK FEMALES THEY CHARTED THEIR CYCLES AND THEN THEY HAD OTHER FEMALES WERE PADS IN THEIR ARMPITS AND THEY COLLECTED SWEAT FROM THOSE FEMALES AND THEN THEY TOOK THE SWEAT FROM THOSE PADS IN THOSE FEMALES ARMPITS AND THEY INTRODUCE THEM TO WOMEN WHO HAD NEVER HAD CONTACT WITH THE PEOPLE WHO HAD SWEATED THEY ONLY HAD CON TACT WITH THEIR SWEAT IN FACT THEY SWABBED IT UNDERNEATH THEIR NOSE BUT IF THAT SOUNDS GROSS THEY DILUDEIT IN ALCOHOL SO MUCH SO THAT THEY CAN'T ACTUALLY DETECT THE ODOR OF THE SWEAT HIT'S ICTUALLY VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE THE SMELL IT'S THE FARMON CHEMICAL ITSELF AND IT TURNS OUT THE FARMON CEMICAL ITSELF CAN MODULATE THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE ALTHOUGH IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY SYNCHRNIZE IT WITH THE SWEATER WHAT IT DOES IS IT CHANGES THE DURATION AND THE PATTERN OF OVULATION RELATIVES AS SO CALLD FILICULAR FASE LONG AN SHORET OF THIS IS THAT THE SWEAT AND FARMONDS OF FEMALES CAN MODULATE THE MENSTRUAL CYCHEL PATTERNS OF OTHER ADULT FEMALES ITS JUST THE QUESTION OF WHETHER NOT THEY SINCHRONIZE AND IF YOU ARE KIND OF ROLLING YOUR EYES DOWN SAYING WELL OF COURSE THEY DO AND THIS IS REALLY DEETELL THIS IS HOW THE SCIENCE IS DONE AND THE REASON WHY PEOPLE ARE SO SCEPTICAL ABOUT THE PRESENCE OF FARMON EFFECTS IN HUMANS IS THAT THERE'S NO WELL IDENTIFIED FARMON ORGAN YOU KNOW WE HAVE AN AREA OF OUR NOSE THAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR SMELLING THAT'S WELL ESTABLISH ITS BEEN OBSERVED IN EMOUREYES MANY MANY TIMES IN CONDAVERS MANY MANTIMES IN PRETTY MUCH ALL INDIVIDUALS BUT THE WOMERONASAL ORGAN WHICH IS THE FARMON DETECTING ORGAN HASN'T REALLY BEEN FOUND IN HUMANS THERE SOMETHING ALL JACOBSOMS ORGAN WHICH IS THOUGHT TO BE THE TE ORGAN IN THE NOSE IS ACTILY ON THE TOP OF THE ROOF OF THE MOUTH AND IN THE BEKIND OF BACK OF THE NOSE IS FORFOU O WINE TASTERS I NEVER CAN PRONOUNCES WHAT ARE THEY CALLD SULMIER SULENLY WHATEVERS THE PEOPLE THAT ARE EXCELLENT AT DRINKING WHEN A DETECTING THE ESSENCE IS OF WINE THAT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUHALL THESE TESTS IN ORDER TO GET CERTIFIED AS ONE OF THEM SOMEBODY TELL ME A THEY ARE USING PROBABLY A SIMILAR MECHANISM OF MIXING TASTE AND SMELL AND JACOBSNS ORGAN IF IT EXISTS THE WOMERNAZEL EQUIVALENT IN HUMANS IS THOUGHT TO BE A COMMINATION OR SMELL AND TASTE NOW IT GETS EVEN WEIRDER AND COOLER WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT A GIVEN STUDY THAT WAS DONE IN HUMANS WHERE IF YOU TAKE HUNDREDS OF TEASHIRTS FROM BOY FRIENDS KEEP THEM SEPARATE YOU TAKE THE THOSE TEA SHIRTS YOU WASH THEM MANY TIMES SEPARATELY AND THEN YOU OFFER THEM TO THE GIRL FRIENDS THE LONG TIME PARTNERS OF THOSE GUYES AND WHAT YOU'LLFIND IS THAT THE E THE GIRL FRIEND CAN PICK OUT HER BOYFRIENDS TEASHIRT AMONG HUNDREDS OF OTHER TEASHIRTS NOT BECAUSE IT SMELLS DIFFERENT BUT BECAUSE SOMETHING ABOUT IT SEEMS DIFFERENT IT MIGHT SMELL DIFFERENT TO HER IN SOME WAY THAT'S KIND OF IMPERCEPTIBLE EVEN TO HER AND THE LEVEL OF ACCURACY IN DETECTING THAT TEA SHIRT HER PARTNERS TEASHIRT IS WAY ABOVE STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANT THRESHOLDS SO MUCH SO THAT YOU ALMOST HAVE TO SAY THEIRE SOMETHING ABOUT THESE EFFECTS THAT ARE REAL FARMONEFFECTS ALTHOUGH PEOPLE STILL ARGUE THAT THEIRE NO FARMON EFFECTS IN HUMANS THAT IT'S ALL THROUGH OLL FACTION I THINK THESE ARE INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT A LOT OFTHINGS COMING THROUGH OUR NOSE WHETHER NOT FARMONS OR SMELLS ARE IMPACTING HORMONES AND OUR ABILITY TO ATTACH MEMORIES AND KIND OF RECOGNITION OF MATES AND OTHER PEOPLE INCLUDING OUR CHILDREN NOCISTORMATES ND OF COURSE PERFUME MANUFACTURES HAVE REALLY PICKED UP ON THE IDEA OF FAIRMONES AND HAVE ENTIRE LABORATORYS SET UP TO BUILD CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS IN TE PERFUMES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ATTRACT OTHEIR MATES THIS IS A WELL ESTABLISHED AND WELL DOCUMENTED PHENOMENON AND THE LAST POINT I'LL MAKE ABOUT FAIRMONS IS THAT THIS COMMINATION OF TASTE AND SMELL IS SUCH A REAL THING IN THE ANIMAL WORLD THAT THERE SOMETHING CALLED THE FLEMIN RESPONSE DURING THE MADING SEASON FOR DIFFERENT ANIMALS A YOU CANNOT SH EVEN SEE THIS AND HORSES BUT FOR ANIMALS THAT ARE SEASONAL MATERS THEY'LL DO SOMETHING CALLE THE FLEMIN RESPONSE WILL THEY ASHLY OPEN THEIR LIPS AND THEIR MOUTH AND THEY EXPOSE THEIR GUMS SO THAT THEY CAN CAPTURE FAIR FAIRMONES THAT ARE FLOATING IN THE WIND AND THE ENVIRONMENT DASHLY ARE LOOKING FOR MATES USING THEIR MOUTH AND KIND OF SNIFFING AROUND IF YOU OWN'T A DOG AN YOU WATCH THE WAY THAT THE DOG WILL SNIFF AROUND SELECTING WHERE THEY WANT A URNATE MALES AND FEMALES THERE'S OFTEN A THEIRE BRINGING MOLECULES INTO THEIR NOSE I KNOW IT SOUNDS KIND OF GROWS SNIFFING URAN BUT THEIR A LOT OF FARMONS IN URANE OF ANIMALS A LOT OF FARMONS AR TRAVELING IN THE WIND AGAIND WHETHERE NOT THIS IS HAPPENING HUMANS I DON'T KNOW BUT THEANYTHING ABOUT THE PERFUME THING AND HERE PEOPLE ARE PUTTING THESE SENSE ON THEMSELVES THAT CONTAIN PUDATIVE FRMONES HUMAN FAIRMONS AND WALKING AROUND HOPING THAT THEIR SENSE ARE GOING TO EVOKE A MEATE SEEKING BEHAVIOR FROM OTHER INDIVIDUALS OF THE SAME HUMAN SPECIES SO WE ARE AMONG THE ANIMALS IN THIS BEHAVIOR INDEPENDENT OF WHETHER NOT YOU BELIEVE FRMON EFFECTS EXIST SO LET'S GET BACK TO BEHAVIORS THAT CAN HELP OPTIMIZE HORMONE LEVELS ONE OF THE MAIN BEHAVIORS THAT'S BEEN SHOWN TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH POOR LEVELS OF ESTROGEN RELATIVE TO AGE MATCH CONTROLS FOR PEOPL WITH OVERIES OR LOWER LEVELS OF TESTASTERON COMPARED TO AGE MATCH CONTROLS FOR PEOPLE WITH TESTIES IS APNIA APHNIA HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH UNDERBREATHING AND THE BUILD UP OF TOO MUCH CARBONDIOXIDE IN THE BODY THEIRE OTHER EFFECTS OF APNA AS WELL BUT IF THERE'S A CONSISTENT LITERATURE IN THIS WHOLE STORY ABOUT AGING AND REDUCTIONS AND HORMONES AND GENERAL HEALTH AND REDUCTIONS AND HORMONS IT'S APHNIA I WENT DEEPINTO THE LITERATURE ON ADVANCED MENOPAS OR WHEN MEN APOUZLE SYMPTOMS ARE EXASCERBATED AND I WENT INTO THE LITERATURE ON ANDROPAUS OR EARLY ON SET ANDROPAUS LEVELS OF TESTACERUM THAT ARE FAR LOWER THAN THEY SHOULD BE FOR A GIVEN AGE AND IN EVERY CASE YOU COULD FIND MULTIPLE PAPERS THAT SHOWED THAT APHNIA OR POOR EFFICIENCY OF BREATHING AND BUILD UP OF TOO MUCH CARBONDOXIDE IN THE BODY WAS A PROBLEM MOSTLY SLEEP APHNIA ALTHOUGH APNIA IN GENERAL WAS SHOWN TO BE IN ISSUE NEGATIVELY IMPACTING HORMONES NOW THE DIRECTIONALITY OF THIS EFFECT ISN'T ENTIRELY CLEAR IT COULD BE THAT REDUCTIONS IN ESTROGEN CAUSE APNIA AND ACTUALLY THERE SOME REASON TO BELIEVE THAT MIGHT BE THE CASE I FOUND AT LEAST ONE PAPER SHOWING THAT THERE ARE ESTROGEN RECEPTERS ON SOME OF THEEP NURONS THAT ACTUALLY INERVATE THE LUNGS AND ALLOW FOR THE PERCEPTION OF HOW FULL OR EMPTY THE LUNGS ARE IN OTHER WORDS REDUCTIONS IN ESTROGEN MAY ADJUST BREATHING BY CHANGING OUR SENSITIVITY TO OUR OWN LUNGS NOW THOW IS TRUE FOR MALES AND FEMALES REMEMBER ESTROGEN N BOTH MALES AND FEMALES BUT AS WELL I FOUND PAPERS IN WHICH TESTOSTERONE REDUCTIONS WHERE ASSOCIATED WITH APNIA AND TESTOSTRONE RECEPTERS ARE ALSO FOUND ON A LOT OF A SELLS IN THE SO CALLED VISERA INCLUDING THE LUNGS SO AGAIN THE DIRECTIONALITY THE EFFECT IS IN CLEAR BUT WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING IS THAT THERE ARE VERY CLEAR WAYS IN WHICH PATTERNS OF BREATHING ESPECIALLY PATTERNS OF BREATHING IN SLEEP CAN MODULATE HORMONES IN WAYS THAT ARE IMMEDIATELY ACTIONABLE AND CAN SERVE TO OPTIMIZE BOTH ESTROGEN AND TESTOSTERONE REGARDLESS OF WHETHE R NOT YOUHAVE OVERIES OR TESTIES SO WHAT IS APNIA APNIA IS UNDERBREATHING OR MAINLY CESSATION OF BREATHING DURING SLEEP SO PEOPLE ARE HOLDING THEIR BREATH AD THEN THE THEY'LL SUDDENLY WAKE UP I SHULD HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIE ON PREVIOUS EPISODES OF THIS PODCAST OF THIS PATTERN OF DOUBLE IN HALES FOLLOWED BY EXAILES THAT ONE CAN DO CONSCIOUSLY TO REDUCE STRAS AND ANXIETY AND OFLO CARBONIOXIDE THAT PATTERN OF BREATHING IS ACTALLY WHAT KICKS IN SPONTANEOUS SLY ANY TIME WE HAVE AN APNIA EPISODE IN SLEEP ALTHOUGH IN MANY PEOPLE OF APNIA THEY DON'T ENGAGE THE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGH PEOPLE WHO ARE DRAMATICALLY OVER WAIGHT ALSO SUFFER A LOT FROM APNIA DURING SLEEP THAES I SHAL A LOT OF BUILD UP OF CARBONDOXIDE IN THE BODY AND THAT CAN LEAD TO EXCESS OF SLEEPINESS DURING THE DAY INABILITY TO ACCESS THE DEEPER PHASES OF SLEEP AND IT'S WELL ESTABLISHED THAT GOING IN TO DEEP SLEEP AND GETTING THE PROPER PATTERNS OF SLOW WAVE SLEEP AND REMSLEEP ARE IMPORTANT FOR HORMONOPTIMIZATION I TALKED ABOUT HOW TO MODULATE SLEEP AND OPTIMIZE SLEEP IN THE FIRST MONTH OF THE HUBERMANLAPODCASTS IPLY CHECK OUT THOSE EPISODES IF YOU HAVE SLEEP ISSUES OR YOU WANT OF WORK ON YOUR SLEEP ALSO CHECK OUT MATWALKERS TERIFIC BOOK WHILE WE SLEEP AND THAT WILL HELP YOU FIND VARIOUS PROTOCALSE TO HLPUOPTIMIZE YOUR SLEEP BUT THE ISSUE OF BREATHING ITSELF CAN BE ADJUSTED IN THE DAYTIME WAKING HOURS IN WAYS THAT CAN POWERFULLY IMPACT BOTH SLEEP REDUCE INCIDENTS OF SLEEP APNIA AND APPARENTLY FROM SOME EMERGING LITERATURE CAN ALSO HELP TO OPTIMIZE VARIOUS HORMONES EVEN JUST BY BREATHING IN PARTICULAR WAYS WHILE AWAP SO HERE'S HOW THIS WORKS THERE'S NOW A LOT OF LITERATURE SHOWING THAT BREATHING THROUGH THE NOSE NOT THROUGH THE MOUTH IS POWERFUL FOR IMPROVING L TS OF THINGS FIRST OF ALL IT IMPROVES COSMETIC FEATURES OF THE JAWN FACE THIS WAS FIRST WELL ESTABLISHED BY MY COLLEAGUES THAT STAMPORD IN BOOK CALLED JAWS THE STORY OF A HIDDEN EPIDEMIC THIS IS BY SANDRI CON AND PALL ERLIC WHO ARE BOTH A FACULTY AT STAMFORD HAS A FORWARD BY ROBERT SUPULSKY THE GREAT ROBERT SUFPULSKY AND IT ALSO HAS A HEAVY ENDORSEMENT UP FRONT A BY GERROD DIAMOND THE AUTHOR OF A GUNS GERMS AND STEAL THE PULLITSOR WINNER SO A LOT OF HEAVY HITTERS ON THIS BOOK JAWS IT'S NOT A BOOK THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT UNFORTUNATELY BUT IT REALLY DESCRIBES THE BENEFITS OF NASAL BREATHING AND THE TERRIBLE THINGS THAT HAPPEN WHEN PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR CHILDREN BUT IT ALS ALSO ARE HEAVY MOUTH BREATHERS SO MOUTH BREATHERS HAVE CHANGES IN THE COSMATICS OF THEIR FACE AND JAW THAT ARE REALLY BAD A IN TERMS OF A ATTRACTIVENESS AND THIS WAS DONE IN TWIN STUDIES YOU CAN LOOK IN THE BOOK AND SEESOMELIS ITS REALLY DRAMATIC HOW BEING A MOUTH BREATHER TENDS TO MAKE THE CHIN DROP BACK BE BEHIND THE UPPER MANDABLE THERE'S A LENGTHENING IN THE FACE A DROOPING OF THE EYES IT CAN BE QUITE DRAMATIC OR MODIS DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH MOUTH BREATHING NOW SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO BREATHED WITH OUR MOUTHS BUT THERE'IS ALSO A LOT OF DATA AND STUDIES TO SCRIBED IN THIS BOOK JAWS THAT DESCRIBE HOW NOS BREATHING IN WAKEFULNESS AND IN SLEEP PROMOTES ALL SORTS OF POSITIVE THINGS RELATED TO NOT JUST COSMETICS BUT ALSO THE IMPROVEMENT OF GAS EXCHANGE OF CARMODOX AT AN OXYGEN IN THE BODY AND AS WELL IT CAN MODIFY LEVELS OF DIFFERENT NAUROW TRANSMITTERS IN NAUROMODULATORS IN WAYS THAT POSIVELY CAN IMPACT HORMONES SO BELIEVE IT OR NOT BEING A NASAL BREATHER AND AVOIDING BEING A MOUTH BREATHER CAN ACTUALLY POSIVELY IMPACT HORMONES AND IN PARTICULAR THE HORMONES TESTSTERONE AND ESTROGEN ALTHOUGH THE WAY THAT IT DOES THAT IS BY MAKING YOU A BETTER SLEEPER WHICH A LOWS YOU TO PRODUCE MORE TESTOSTERONE AND THE APPROPRIATE MOUNTS OF TESTOSTRONE AND ESTROGEN BUT IT DOES THAT IN PART THROUGH INDIRECT MECHANISMS BECAUSE DEEP SLEEP SUPPORTS THE GONATS THE OVEREASON AND THE TESTACLES AND THER TURNOVER OF CELLS AN THE PRODUCTION OF CELLS REMEMBER IN IN THE OVERY PARTICULAR CELLS AND THE EGFALICALS THEMSELVES MAKE ESTROGEN AND IN THE IN THE TEIN THE TESTICLE THAT THE SERTOLY CELLS AND THE LIGTIC CELLS ARE IMPORTANT FOR THE FORMATION OF SPERMAN FOR TESTOSTERONE RESPECTIVELY SO WHAT DOES TUS ALL MEAN THIS MEANS WE HAVE TO BE BREATHING PROPERLY IT ALMOST SOUNDS KIND OF A IN A A LIKE ON A NEW AGE LIKE HAT WE HAVE TO BREATHE PROPERLY GET YOUR HORMONES RIGHT BUT NO YET TO BREATHE PROPERLY TO GET YOUR BREATHING AND SLEEP RIGHT SO THAT YOUR SLEEP CAN ACTUALLY BE DEEP ENOUGH IN YOUR NOT ENTERING APNEOS STATES AND THEN THAT WILL SUPPORT GONAD FUNCTION AND I WOULD'T BE PUTTING THESOUT AS ONE OF THE MAIN BEHAVIORAL TOOLS UP FRONT IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE FACT THAT THE EFFECTS OF APNEA ON THESE HORMONES ARE DRAMATIC AND TERRIBLE AND THE POSIVE EFFECTS OF GETTING BREATHING RIGHT ON THESE HORMONES TESTOSTERON AND ESTROGEN ARE DRAMATIC AND WONDERFUL SO LET'S T K ABOUT A FEW OF THOSE STUDIES BRIEFLY SO I CAN UNDER SCORE THE VALUE OF PROPER BREATHING IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE HORMONES SO I WAS ABLE TO FIND AT LEAST FOUR QUALITIE STUDIES SHOWING THAT WHEN APNEA IS REDUCED IN SLEEP OR ELIMINATED THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN TESTOSTRON AND MALES AND IN PROPER ESTROGEN TO TESTOSTRON RATIOS AND FEMALES AND THE WAY THAT IT WORKS IS VERY INTERESTING APPARENTLY IT WORKS BY REDUCTIONS IN CARESALL NOW CORTIS ALL DISTRESS HORMONE THAT IS RELEASED EARLY IN THE DAY AS WE WAKE UP AND SERVES HEALTHY ROLLS IN PROTECTING US AGAINST INFECTION REDUCING INFLAMMATION ET CETERA BUT YOU DON'T WANT CUARTERS ALL TO BE TOO HIGH AND YOU CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO ELEVATED TOO LONG THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND NIGHT AND SO WE ALL KNOW BECAUSE NOW WE'VE BEEN TOLD A LOT IN THE LAST DECATE OR SO THAT GETTING PROPER SLEEP IS IMPORTANT OR ALL THESE ASPECTS OF HEALTH GETTING PROPER SLEEP CAN A REALLY OFFSET ALL THE REDUCTIONS IN TESTOSTRON AND ESTROGEN AND REDUCTIONS AND FERTILITY THAT A CURVE WE DN'T GET ENOUGH SLEEP BUT  SELDOM IS IT DISCUSS HOW SLEEP ACTUALLY ADJUST THINGS LIKE TESTOSTRONE AND ESTROGEN AND IT DOES IT BY MODIFYING CARTISALL SO THE MOLECULE COLESTERALL CAN BE CONVERTED INTO TESTOSTRONE OR ESTROGEN BUT THERE'S A COMPETITION WHEREBIGH TO THE COLESTRALL WILL TURN INTO CORTESALL AND NOT TESTOSTRONE OR IT'LL TURN IN TO CORTIS ALL AND NOT ESTROGEN IF STRES LEVELS OR TOO HIGH SO THE SIMPLE VERSION OF THIS IS GETTING YOUR BREATHING RIGHT DURING THE WAKING HOURS MEANING PRIMARILY UNLESS YOUR WORKING OUT REALLY HARD OR THER SOME OTHER REASON WHY YOUR MAY BE EATING OR SPEAKING THAT YOU NEED BE BREATHING THROUGH YOUR MOUTH YOU SHOULD BE AN NOS BREATHER THERE'S REALLY GOOD EVIDENCE FOR THAT NOW AND IN SLEEP YOU ALSO WANT TO BEA NOSE BREATHER BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF OXYGEN THAT YOUR BRING INTO YOUR SYSTEM IN THE AMOUNT OF CARBONDOXIDE THAT YOU'RE OFF LOATING THER'RE OTHER PAUS OFE EFFECTS OF IT AS WELL BUT YOU'RE BASELY REDUCING APNEA BREATH HOLDING IN SLEEP LEADS TO BUILD UP OF CARBONDOXIDE AND LEADS TO INCREASES IN CORTESALL WHICH THEN DECREASE TESTOSTRONE AND DECREASE ESTROGEN IN NEGATIVE WAYS ACROSS ALL SEXES OCI SO THE SIMPLE VERSION OF THIS IS GET YOUR BREATHING RIGHT SO HOW DO YOU DO THAT HOW YOU GET YOUR BREATHING RIGHT WELL FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT HAVE SEVERE SLEEP APNEAM THEY ARE GOING TO NEED THE SEAPAT MACHINE THIS IS A MACHINE THAY AS YOU PUT ON YOUR FACE AN IT HELPS YOU BREATHE PROPERLY IN SLEEP MANY PEOPLE HOWEVER ARE STRYING TO DO THIS THING OF TAPING THEIR MOUTH SHUT NOW THE SOUNDS A LITTLE BIT EXTREME AND YOU CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO I DO THIS IN ANY WAY THAT'S DANGEROUS JAMES NESTER TALKED ABOUT THIS IN HIS BOOK A BREATH THE NEW SCIENCE OF A LOSTART THAT SIMPLY TAPING SHUT THE MOUTH WITH SOME TAPE THAT A WILL  ALLOW YOU TO OPEN YOUR MOUTH IF YOU REALLY NEED TO DURING SLEEP CAN ALLOW PEOPLE TO SHIFT OVER FROM BE MOUTH BREATHERS AND SNORES OT TO NOSE BREATHERS IN THE DAYTIME THE BEST WAY TO GET GOOD AT NASAL BREATHING IS TO DILATE THE NASAL PASSAGES CA ALOPULA HARTIME BREATHING THROUGH THEIR NOSE AND ONE WAY TO DO THIS IS JO JUST BREATH THRO G YOUR NOSE MORE AND ONE WAY TO DO THAT IS THAT WHEN YOU EXERCISE IN PARTICULAR CARTVASCULAR EXERCISE MOST OF THE TIME PROVIDED YOU'RE NOT IN MAXIMUM EFFORT YOU SHOULD BE NAZAL BREATHING NOW FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE NAZAL BREATHING DURING EXERCISES HARD AT FIRST BUT AS YOU DO IT BECAUSE THE SCINESSES HAVE A CAPACITY TO DILATE OVER TIME YOU'LL GET BETTER AT IT THE SCINESS IS O IF YOU HAVENA'T EVER HELD TA SKULL OF FOR BECAUSE MY JOB AS THE NERSINTIS HAVE HELD A LOT OF SKULLS TO E A LOT OF BRAINS AT A LOT OF SKLLS A TEACHNERANATOMY IND DONE THAT FOR GOODNESS A I GOT KNOWS HOW MANY SPECIES HAVE DONE THAT FOR INCLUDING HUMAN BUT WHAT THE SCINESSES ARE THEIRE ACTUALLY WHAT YOU'VE GOT OR GOT THESE LITTLE PORTALS IN THE BONE THAT RUN YOU OW UP HERE AND DOWN HERE BEHIND THE OND THE NOSE AND INTO THE JAW IF YOU EVER HAD A COLD IN YOUR SCINESSES OR STUFFED UP YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE CONGESTION HERE AND HERE AND AROUND YOUR HERES AND IN YOUR CHEEKS IN I YOUR FACE AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE SCNESSES ARE ACTUALLY PORTALS WHERE THE BONES ARE ARE FUSED TOGETHER AN INTERDIGITATE LIKE THIS BUT THEIRE LINED OF COURSE WITH MUCUS MEMBRANES AND AS YOU START TO NAZAL BREATHE MORE THE NASAL PASSAGES WILL TART TO DILATE MORE DON'T OR UNOC CANY A GIANT NOSTRILS BUT WHAT'S CAN END OF HAPPENINGS YOU CAN HAVE AN EASIER TIME BREATHING THROUGH YOUR NOSE JUST FROM WAKING SO MY ADVICE WOULD BE BREATHE THROUGH YOUR NOSE WHILE EXERCISEING UNLESS YOU'RE N MAXIMUM EFFORT PRETTY SOON WHAT YOU'LL FIND AS YOU ACTUALLY CAN CREATE MORE OUTPUT THAN YOU WOULD IF YOU ARE BREATHING THROUGH YOUR MOUTH AND OF COURSE THEIRE EXCEPTIONS TO THIS IF YOUR SWIMMING FOLLOW THAT BREATH PROTOCALL FOR FIGHTERS IN MARTIAL ARTISTS THERE'S REASON TO DO THE KIND OF A EXTAIL BREATHING THROUGH THE MOUTH THE SH KIND OF THING IN OTHER REASONS TO DO THAT SORT OF THING FOR PARTICULAR SPORTS BUT FOR MOST PEOPLE WHO ORK ON RECREATIONAL ATHLETES OR EXERCISERS LEARN TO BE A NAZAL BREATHER HAS PAUSIVE COSMETIC EFFECTS IT REDUCES APNIA IT OLFFLOADS MORE CARBONOXIDE IT INCREASES LONG CAPACITY IT DILATES THE SCINESSES AND IT PREVENTS APNIA IN SLEEP SO UNLESSYOU HAVE SEVERE APNIA AND YOU NEED THE SEA PAP NAZE BECOMING A NAZAL BREATHER CAN HAVE ALL SORTS OF PAUSE OFE EFFECTS BY REDUCING CORTIS ALL REDUCING APNIA AND INDIRECTLY RAISING TOSTOSTRON AND ESTROGEN IN THE PROPER RATIOS SO THIS MIGHT SEEM KIND OF FOUNDATIONAL AND INDIRECT BUT WHEN YOU GO INTO THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE IT COMES THROUGH AS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO THAT IS ZERO COST TAKES A LE EFFORT BUT AT ZERO COST AND IT HAS ALL THESE POSIVE EFFECTS ACROSS THE BOARD YOU KNOW BOTH COSMATIC AND IN SLEEP AND HORMONAL ET CETERA SO THAT'S THE FIRST PIECE OF BEHAVIORAL ADVICE THE SECOND PIECE OF BEHAVIORAL VICE RELATES TO THE VIEWING OF LIGHT AND MANY OF YOU HAVE HEARD ME TALK ABOUT THIS BEFORE AND I'M NOT IN A BELABOR THE POINT THAT VIEWING BRIGHT LIGHT WITHIN THE FIRST HOUR OF WAKING WHETHER NOTS FROM ARTIFICIAL LIGHT OR IDEALLY FROM SUNLIGHT HAS THESE POWERFUL EFFECTS ON SLEEP AND WAKEFULNESS BUT WE HAVE TO RETURN TO THIS IF YOU WANT O UNDERSTAND HOW LIGHT CAN IMPACT HORMONES BECAUSE HORMONES LIGHT AND DOPAMINE HAVE A VERY CLOSE IN IT RELATIONSHIP SO MUCH SO THAT YOUR LIGHT VIEWING BEHAVIOR CAN ACTUALLY HAVE A DIRECT EFFECT ON HORMON LEVELS AND FERTILITY IT CAN HAVE A DIRECT EFFECT ON HORMON LEVELS AND LEBIDO IT CAN HAVE A DIRECT EFFECT ON HORMON LEVELS AND YOUR ABILITY TO HEAL QUICKLY AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT SHINING LIGHT ON PARTICULAR INJURIES THAT MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE PASIVE EFFECTS AM YOU KNOW IF WE CAN ARGUE ABOUT THAT ON A PREON A SUBSEQUENT EPISODE IT MAY BUT WHAT I'M TYING ABOUT IS VIEWING LIGHT WITH YOUR EYES SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT NOW BECAUSE THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE ON THIS ARE ROBUST AND THEY EXTEND BACK SEVERAL DECADES AND YET I THINK MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW POWERFUL THIS RELATIONSHIP IS BETWEEN LIGHT DOPAMINE HORMONES AND ALL THE GREAT THINGS THAT THE SEXTORID HORMONS DO WHEN THEIR AVAILABLE IN YOUR BODY IN THE PROPER RATIOS IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE POWERFUL EFFECTS THAT LIGHT CAN HAVE ON THE SEXTEROD HORMONES WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND SEASONAL BREEDING ANIMALS NOW HUMANS ARE NOT SEASONAL BREEDERS BUT IF YOU UNDERSTAND THE BIOLOGY OF HOW LIGHT IMPACTS VARIOUS NOR TRANSMITTERS AND HORMONES YOU'LL SET YOURSELF UP FOR A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT YOU SHOULD DO WITH YOUR LIGHT VIEWING BEHAVIOR SO SEVERAL SPECIES OF ANIMALS MANY SPECIES OF ANIMALS IN FACT LIKE RABBITS AND FOX AND VARIOUS MUSTOLIDS LIKE FERRETS AND ERMINES CHANGE THEIR PELLAGE COLOR ACROSS THE SEASONS THIS MIGHT BE KIND OF A DU BUT FOX IN WINTER ARE OFF IN WHIT OR LIGHT GRAY AND THOSE SAME ANIMALS WILL BE BROWN OR DARKER COLORED IN THE SUMMER TIME IND SPRING MONTHS NOW THOE SAME ANIMALS BREED IN THE SPRING AND THEY SHUT DOWN BREEDING THEY ACTUALLY SHUT DOWN OVULATION THEY OFTEN SHUT DOWN TESTOSTERON PRODUCTION IN THE WINTERMONTHS SOS RIGHT NOW I'M JUST CORRELATING COLOR OF FUR WITH TENDENCY TO BREED TENDENCY TO BREED AS WE KNOW IS GOING TO BE RELATED TO LEVELS OF SEXTROID HORMONS ESTRGEN INTO STOSTRON NOW WHY WOULD THESE TWO THINGS BE LINKED WILL IT TURNS OUT THAT DOPAMINE IS THE LINK BETWEEN THEM SO DOPAMINE HAS A PRECURSER THAT PRECURSOR IS TYROSENE WHICH COME WHICH IS A MENOACID COMES FROM FOOD AND WHEN DOPAMINE LEVELS ARE HIGH AS I MENTION BEFORE THERE'S A TENDENCY FOR MORE CAN ADDATROP AND RELEASING HORMON LUTINIZING HORMON PHOLICAL STIMULATING HORMON ALL THE HORMONS THAT COME FROM THE HYP WITH THELAMIC PETUITARY AXIS AND STIMULATE ESTROGEN AND TESTOSTERON RELEASE FROM THE OVERY AND TESTIS DOPAMINE BASILY INCREASES ALL OF THAT THE PRECURSER TO DOPAMINE IS TYROSINE BUT THE PRECURSOR TO A LOT OF THE MELONIN PRODUCING ELEMENTS OF CELLS THAT GIVE PIGMENTATION INCLUDING FOR THE HAIR IS TYROSINE AND TYROSENASE AND ENZON SO YES THE SAME AMINOACID BASED PATHWAY AND MANY OF THE SAME ENZIMS THAT ARE DEVOTED TO DOPAMINE AND DOPAMINE IN CREASING THE SEXSTORID HORMONES ARE DEVOTED TO GIVING PIGMENTATION TO THE HAIR AN SKIN AND THIS IS WHY IN THE SUMMER MONTHS WHEN DAYS ARE LONGER ANIMALS ARE BREEDING MORE AND THIS IS ALSO WHY IN THE WINTER MONTHS WHEN DAYS ARE SHORTER ANIMALS ARE BREEDING LESS THIS IS ALSO WHY IN HUMANS MANY PEOPLE NOT ALL FEEL AN ELEVATION AND MOOD IN THE SPRING AND SUMMER MONTHS BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF SUNLIGHT THEIR GETTING IS INCREASED RELATIVE TO THE WINTER MONTHS AW SOME OF YOU MAY BE SAING I LOVE THE FALL I LOVE THE WINTER SENSITIVITY TO LIGHT IN THESE DOPOMING SYSTEMS HAS A STRONG GENETIC COMPONENT SO YOU GO TO SUM AREAS THE WORLD I'VE RELATIVES A WHO ARE SCANNINAVIAN AND IN SUM AREAS OF SKANANAVIA PEOPLE KNOW THAT THERE IS A KIND OF SEASONABLE EFFECT TO DISORDER THIS KIND OF A SEASONAL DEPRESSION AND PE WILL GET SADDER AND MORE QUIECENT IN THE WINTER THERE'S ACTUALLY ALESS GOING OUT AND THEREFORE THERE'S LESS A SEXUAL BEHAVIOR THERE'S LESS OF A PARTYING IND THINGS OF THAT SORT BUT OTHER PEOPLE WILL SAY NO DURING THE WINTER MONTHS I FEEL GREAT AND I LOVE THE HOLIDAYS AROUND WINTER ET CETERA S THERE'S A LOT OF VARIATION BUT IN GENERAL THE PATHWAY IS THE FOLLOWING INCREASED VIEWING OF SUNLIGHT AND IT HAS TO BE TO THE EYES IT'S NOT TO THE SKIN INCREASE VIEWING OF SUNLIGHT INCREASES DOPOMING LEVELS IN THE BRAIN INCREASE DOPOMING LEVELS IN ANIMALS AND HUMANS INCREASES THE AMOUNT OF THESE MALANICITES AND THE ACTIVITY OF THESE MELON AND PRODUCING CELLS WHICH GIVE PIGMENTATION TO THE SKIN AND HAIR AND INDIRECTLY INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF TESTOSTRON AND ESTROGEN AND THEREBY REPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOR FEELINGS O WELL BEING SOCIAL INTERACTIONS REDUCTIONS ANXIETY ET CETERA ALL OF WHICH SHOULD MAKE SENSE BASED ON WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT ALREADY IN TERMS OF THE BIOLOGY AND THE IMPACT OF THESE A STERID HORMONES ON VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE MIND AND BODY SO HOW DOES THIS TRANSLATE TO A PROTOCAL THIS TRANSLATES TO THE PROTOCAL OF IF YOU WANT TO OPTIMIZE TESTSTRON AN ESTROGEN YOU NEED TO GET YOUR LIGHT VIEWING BEHAVIOR CORRECT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT OPTIMIZING YOUR SLEEP WHICH IS ALSO IMPORTANT IT'S ABOUT GETTING SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF LIGHT IN YOUR EYES SO YOU HAVE SUFFICIENT LEVELS OF DOPOMI SO THE SIMPLE PROTOCLS FOR THAT I'VE REVIEWED BEFORE BUT IT MEANS GETTING ANYWHERE FROM TWO TO TEN MINUTES OF BRIGHT LIGHT EXPOSURE IN YOUR EYES EARLY IN THE DAY IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO DO THIS WITH SUNGLASSES UNLESS YOUHAVE TO DO THAT FOR SAFETY REASONS IT'S FINE TO WHERE PRESCRIPTION LENDSES AND CONTACTS IF YOU CAN'T GET SUNLIGHT FOR WHATEVER REASON YOU WANT TO USE BRIGHT ARTIFICIAL LIGHT BUT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL FOR TIMING THE QUARTERS ALL RELEASE PROPERLY LIMITING QUARTERS ALL RELEASE TO THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY GETTING INCREASES IN DOPOMING THAT ARE GOING TO PROMOTE THE PRODUCTION OF TESTASTRON AND ESTROGEN TO HEALTHY LEVELS THE OTHER ASPECT OF LIGHT VIEW IN BEHAVIOR THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IS TO AVOID BRIGHT LIGHT EXPOSURE TO YOUR EYES IN THE MIDDLE F THE NIGHT IF YOUR VIEWING BRIGHT LIGHT I THE MIDDLE THE NIGHT YOU ARE SUPPRESSING DOPOMINE RELEASE IF YOUR SUPPRESSING DOP OMIN RELEASE YOU ARE SUPPRESSING TESTASTRON LEVELS SO MUCH SO THAT I WOULD WAGER THAT A MAJOR EFFECT OF SLEEP DEPROVATION ON REDUSING TESTASTRONE AND ESTROGEN IS NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF SLEEP PER SEY IT'S BECAUSE USUALLY WHEN PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING ENOUGH SLEEP THEY'RE GETTING TOO MUCH LIGHT IN THEIR EYES IN THE MILL THE NIGHT AS WELL A STUDY ON THIS HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETED YET BUT THERE ARE TWO STUDIES PUBLISHED IN SELL AND NURON BOSELPRESTOURNALS EXCELLENT JOURNALS SHOWING THAT VIEWING BRIGHT LIGHT WITH THE EYES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CIRCADIAN NIGHT HAS A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON DOPOMINE AND THEREFORE HAS A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON THINGS LIKE TESTOSTRNE AND ESTROGEN SO YOU CANNY BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT SUPPLEMENTS AND OTHER WAYS TO OPTIMIZE TESTOSTRON DIETANTS EFFECTS ON TESTOSTRON AND ESTROGEN AND FERTILITY AND REPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOR ET CETERA UNTIL YOU GET YOUR BREATHING RIGHT UNTIL YOU GET THINGS LIKE YOUR LIGHT VIEWING BEHAVIOR RIGHT SO BRIGHT LIGHT EARLY IN THE DAY AND THROUGHOUT THE DAY IS GREAT VIEW AS MUCH BRIGHT LIGHT IDEALLY SUNLIGHT AS YOU CAN AS MUCH AS YOU SAFELY CAN YU OVISIDOWANTO BURN YOUR RETNAS OR DAMAGE YOURETNA SO NEVER LOOK AT ANY LIGHT THAT SO BRIGHT ITS PAINFUL LOOK AT BUT GETTING A LOT OF LIGHT IN YOUR EYES IS NOT JUST ABOUT ADJUSTING YOUR SLEEP WAKE RHYTHMS IT'S ALSO ABOUT OPTIMIZING YOUR SEXTORID HORMONTS AND AVOIDING BRIGHT LIGHT IN MILL THE NIGHT IS NOT JUST ABOUT NOT DISRRUPTING YOUR SLEEP IT'S ALSO ABOUT OPTIMIZING THE SEXTORID HORMONTS AND NOW THAT YOU UNDERSTAND A BIT OF HOW THIS EXTROID HORMON'S WORK AND HOW POWERFUL THEY ARE FOR REDUCING ANXIETY IN ALL THESE OTHER EFFECTS THIS SHOULD BE STRAIGHTFORWARD TO DO OR HOPEFULLY IT'S INSPIRED YOU TO GET YOUR LIGHT VIEWING BEHAVIOR AND YOUR BREATHING BEHAVIOR CORRECT IN FACT IN THINKING ABOUT TOOLS FOR MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE SUFFERING FROM LOW LEVELS OF ESTROGEN IF THEY WANT HIGHER LEVELS OR LOW LEVELS OF TESTASRON THEY WANT HIGHER LEVELS JUST GETTING THE BREATHING AND LIGHT VIEWING BEHAVIOR WHICH WILL INDIRECTLY SUPPORT SLEEP BEHAVIOR CAN BE A HUGE AND POSITIVE EFFECT ON LEVELS OF SEXTORID HORMONTS I CAN ALREADY ANTICIPATE THAT IN HEARING THIS YOU MIGHT WONDER WHETHER NOT VIEWING LIGHT IS GOING TO FOR INSTANCE INCREASE YOUR TESTAOSTRONAL LOT WHEN IN FACT YOU WANT YOUR ESTROGEN INCREASED TORY ITS GOING TO INCREASE YOUR ESTROGEN LLOT WHEN YOU WANT YOUR TESTOSTRONE INCREASED EVERYTHING I'M DESCRIBING HERE IS FOR PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF CROMAZOMOL OR GONATTLE BACKGROUND SO I'M TRYING TO BASICALLY OFFER ALL THIS INFORMATION IN ONES IN ONE SWOOP BUT BASICALLY IF YOUR SOMEBODY WHO NATURALLY HAS OVERIES AND HAS HIGHER LEVELS OF ESTROGEN THAN TESTASTRON THEN VIEWING BRIGHT LIGHT EARLY IN THE DAY BECAUSE OF DOPAMENS EFFECTS ARE IS GOING TO PROMOTE MORE ESTROGEN AND SUBTLE INCREASES IN TESTSTRONE WHEREAS IF YOUARE SOMEBODY WHO STARTSOFF WITH MORE TESTOSTRONE AND LOWER ESTROGEN SO SOMEBODY PRESUMABLY WHO HAS TESTES OR MAY BE YOUR SUPPLEMENTING WITH TESTASTRN THROUGHOTHER SOURCES FOR WHATEVER REASON BRIGHT LIGHT VIEWING IS GOING TO INCREASE TESTOSTRONE AND ESTROGEN IN PARALLEL BUT YOU'RE STILL GEN A MAINTAIN THE RATIO OF TESTOSTRONE VESTROGEN IN SHORT YOU N'T HAVE TO WORRY THAT OU CAN INCREASE THE WRONG HORMONE THIS IS ALL ABOUT OPTIMIZING THE RATIOS OF HORMONES THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE OCASE AT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BREATHING WE'VE TALKED ABOUT LIGHT LET'S TALK ABOUT A THIRD ELEMENT THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME EXCITEMENT ABOUT LATELY A FOR OTHER REASONS BUT THAT CAN ACTUALLY HAVE SOME PRETTY PROFOUND INFLUENCES ON HORMONE LEVELS AND THAT'S HEAT AND COLD SO AS ALWAYS RATHER THAN JUST OFFER A TOOL I'M GOING TO TELL YOU THE UNDERLYING SCIENCE AS IT RELATES TO NATURALLY OCCURRING PHENOMENO BECAUSE IN UNDERSTANDING THAT AND UNDERSTANDING THE MECHANISM YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN A FAR BETTER POSITION TO UNDERSTAND THE TOOLS AND MECHANISMS AND HOW YOU MIGHT WANT A JOST THEM FOR YOUR OWN LIFE SO NOW YOU UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LIGHT DAYLENGTH DOPAMINE AND HORMONE LEVELS AND EVERYONE SHOULD REALIZE THAT TEMPERATURE AND DAYLENGTH ARE LENKED AND I'M SURE AS HI SAY THAT YOUREBOLLY THINKING ON OF COURSE IN SUMMER WHEN THERE'S MORE SUN LIGHT DAYS ARE LONGER NIGHTS ARE SHORTER IN GENERAL TENDS TO BE WARMER OUT AND IN WINTER WHEN NIGHTS ARE LONGER DAYS ARE SHORTER IT TENDS TO BE COLDER OUT ND IN THE WINTER MONTHS TES TOSTRON AND ESTROGEN TEND TO BE LOWER IN MANY ANIMALS AND IN HUMANS AND IN THE SUMMER MONTHS BECAUSE OF THE ROLL OF DOPAMINE IN PROMOTING THES EXTRID HORMONS WHEN DAYS ARE LONGER AND ITS WARMER HUMANS TEND TO MAKE MORE ESTROGEN AND TESTOTRON RELATIVE TO THE OTHER MONTHS OF THE YEAR NOW THESE EFFECTS CAN BE SOMEWHAT WEAK AND MODULATED AS OPPOSED TO IN SEASONLY BREATHING ANIMALS WHERE THE REALLY DRAMATIC I BUT THE POINT IS THAT TEMPERATURE AND DAYLENGTH AND SUNLIGHT THOSE ARE ALL INTIMATELY RELATED BECAUSE OF THE SYSTEMS THAT WE EVOLVED IN RIGHT SO BEFORE WE HAD ARTIFICIAL LIGHT AND ARTIFICIAL HEATING AND ARTIFICIAL COOLING ARE BIOLOGY EVOLVED UNDER SYSTEMS WHERE TEMPERATURE DAYLENGTH AND THE HORMONES WERE CORRELATED WITH ONE ANOTHER SO NOWADAYS THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST IN USING COLD AS A WAY TO STIMULATE TOSTOSTRONE THIS IS MAINLY BECAUSE IN THE YOU KNOW IN THE SPORTS COMMUNITY IN PARTICULAR IN THE BODY BUILDING COMMUN THEY ARE ALWAYS SEEKING WAYS TO MAXIMIZE TESTOSTRONE DIHOGER TESTOSTRONE KEEP ESTROGEN TOITS MINIMUM REQUIRE TO STILL HAVE LEBIDO AND STILL HAVE U NOSKIN ELASTICITY BUT ALSO WALK AROUND WITH SERANRAPSKIN THAN ALL THITS KIND OF EXTREME STUFF THAT HAPPENS THERE HAS LED TO A RECENT MOVEMENT WHERE BELIEVE ORE NOT I HEARD THIS AND I I CAN BELIEVE I WENT AN CHECKED BUT THOUGH IT DIDN'T BUY THEM THAT ON AMAZON YOU CAN ACTUALLY FIND AT PEOPLE HAVE THEIR LITERALLY UNDERWARE THAT HAVE ICE PACKS ARE THING THEIR ICE PACK UNDERWARES SO THAT PEOPLE ARE MAKING THEMSELVES COLD AT THE LEVEL OF THE GONADS IN ORDER TO TRY AN INCREASE TESTOSTERONE AND LEBITO SOUNDS PRETTY CRAZY BUT BELIEVE IT ORE NOT THAT AND THINGS LIKE ICE BAS AND COLD SHOWERS CAN HAVE POSITIVE EFFAC CTS ON THE SEXSTOROID HORMONS BOTH TESTASTRON MAINLY AND MALES AND ESTROGEN MAINLY IN FEMALES AND YOU MIGHT SAY WEIGHT I THOUGHT COLD MAKES THE REPRODUCTIVE AXIS KIND OF SHUT DOWN AF BIT ARE REDUCES TO STOSTRON AND ESTROGEN BUT IT TURNS OUT ITS NOT ACTUALLY THE COLD THAT'S HAVING THESE EFFECTS IN PEOPLE THINGS LIKE THE ICE BATH COLD SHOWERS COLD WATER SWIMS THESE A ICE UNDERHER WHATEVERTHEY ARE CAN BELIEVE AT THESE ASH EXIST BUT OM THEY DO EXIST WHAT HAPPENS IS THERE'S A REBOUND INVAO DILATION AFTER COOLING SO COOLING CAUSES VASO CONSTRICTION AND THEN AFTER THE COOLING THERE'S A REBOUND VAZO DILATION AND THERE'S MORE INFUSION OF BLOOD INTO THE GONADS THERE'S ALSO AN EFFECT THAT'S NURAL SELEMMI EXPLAIN HOW THIS WORKS BECAUSE THEREARE ONLY A FEW STUDIES ON THIS NONE OF WHICH LOOKING AT THE FROZEN UNDERWHERE BUT THAT HAVE LOOKED AT COLD EXPOSURE AND LEVELS OF ANDROGENS AND ESTROGENS AS CONEOF INTERESTING SO YO EVE TO REMEMBER THAT THE GONAD THE OVERIES AN THE TESTIS ARE HEAVILY VASCULARIZED REMEMBER EVEN AT THE LEVEL OF THE BRAIN GENOR H CANATITROPAN RELEASING HORMON COMES FROM NURONS THAT BELIEVE ARE NOT START OFF IN YOUR NOSE EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT MIGRATE INTO THE HYPOTHALEMIS AN NOT MAKING THAT OUP THEY TARTED OFF IN YOUR NOSE MIGRATING TE HYPOTHALMAS THOSE NURONS EXTEND PROCESSES WE CALL THEM ACTS ONS INTO THE PETUITARY AND RELEASE GEAN OUR H INTO THE POTUITARY THERE'S A LOT OF ASCULARZATION WITHIN THE POTUITARY SO NOW THOSE HORMONS OR GEANOR AH CAN THOSE CAN STIMULATE PHOLICAL STIMULATING HORMON LUTINIZING HORMON WHICH THEN ARE RELEASED AND TRAVEL INTO THE BLOODSTREAM THEN THOSE HORMONS REACH THE OVERY OR TESTES AND THEY HAVE TO GET INTO THE OVEREAN TESTIS AND THE WAY THEY DO THAT IS THROUGH THE VASCULAR SYSTEM AND PEOPLE FORGET BUT THE VASCULAR SYSTEM AND HOW CONSTRICTED OR DILATED VESSELS ARE IS CONTROLLED BY NURONS RIGHT THIS IS WHIC WE DISCUSSIS DURING HE DISCUSSION ABOUT STRESS IN THE STRESS EPISODE BUT IT'S WELL KNOWN TO NURO SCIENTISTS THAT THE BEST WAY TO SHUT DOWN NURONS IS TO COOL THEM SO WE THEE A LOT OF EXAMPLES OF THIS IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE BUT MOST PEOPLE ARE NAWARE ICAUSE YOU ARE NOT DIGGING AROUND IN THE METHOD SECTION OF THESE PAPERS BUT WHEN WE WANT A SHUT DOWN NURONS WE CAN DO THINGS LIKE INJECT DRUGS THAT WILL DO THAT LIKE LIDACANE NEAL THE STUFF THAT MAKES YOU KNOM AN THE DENTIST OR YOU CAN USE DIFFERENT INHIBITERS ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO DO IT EXPERIMENTALLY IS TO JUST COOL NURONS WHEN YOU MAKE NURONS COLD BECAUSE THERE'S A TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF WHEN NURONS CAN BE ACTIVEIN WHEN THEY CAN'T THE NURON SHUT DOWN SO THE MOST PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATION FOR WHY COLD EXPOSURE EITHER THROUGH YOU KNOW ONE TO TEN MINUTE ICE BATH OR COLD SHOWER OR THE ICE UNDERPANCE THING WOULD INCREASE TESTASTRON OR INCREASE ESTROGEN IS THAT YOURE COOLING THE NURONS THAT CONTROL VAZO CONSTRICTION OF ASO DILATION AND SHUTTING N DOWN THE ENTRY OF BLOOD OR AT LEAST REDUCING IT AND HORMONES INTO THE GONAD AND THEN WHEN THE GONAD AND THE SURROUNDING AREA HEATS UP AGAIN YOU'RE GETTING A REBOUND HYPEROVASO DILATION THAT DELIVERS EXCESSIVE LEVELS OF NOT EXCESSIVE BUT INCREASED LEVELS OF GE IN OUR AGE AND OTHER HORMONS AND CARRIERS AND CARRIER PROTINES AND SO FORTH THAT WOULD THEN STIMULATE THE GONAD TO RELEASE MORE TESTOSTRONE OR WOULD STIMULATE THE GONAD TO RELEASE MORE ESTROGEN THAT'S THE MOST PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATION I CAN COME UP WITH THERE ARE 'NO LOT OF STUDIES LOOKING AT DIRECT EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE ON THE GONAD AND IT'S GOING TO BE A DIFFICULT STUDY TO CARRY OUT IN ANY CASE BECAUSE UNLESS IT WERE DONE IN VETRO IN A DISH IT'S VERY HARD TO ELIMINATE ALL THE OTHER THINGS LIKE VASO CONSTRICTION VASO DILATION PUT SIMPLY WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT COLD AND HEAT DIRECTLY EFFECT THE PRODECT THE PRODUCTION OF TESTOTRONAND ESTROGEN WE ONLY KNOW THAT COLD AND HEAT CAN MODULATE THOSE PROBABLY THROUGH INDIRECT MECHANISMS LIKE CONTROLLING THE AMOUNT OF BLOOD FLOW BY WAY OF SHUTTING DOWN OR ACTIVATING THE NURONS NOW THERE'S A LOT OF LORE AROUND HEATING UP THE GONADS TOO MUCH EXACTUALLY A A WHOLE SET OF OF PSEUDO SCIENCE A WED PAGES OUT THERE SAYING WELL IF YOU WANT A GIRL YOU SHOULD YOU KNOW CONCEIVE THE CHILD THAT THIS ROOM TEMPERATURE AND IF YOU WANT A BOY YOU SHOULD CONCEIVE THE CHILD THAT THIS ROOM TEMPERATURE I I DON'T THING THERE'S REALLY ANY FIRM SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE FOR THAT O FOR EITHER ONE BUT THERE'S SOME INTERESTING LITERATURE ABOUT TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF PRODUCTION OF HORMONS AND I THINK THAT IT PROBABLY RELATES TO THESE MECHANISMS OF VASO DILATION AND NURL CONTROL OVER VASO DILATION AND OF COURSE EXCESSIVELY HIGH HEAT IS NOT GOOD FOR THE TESTEES FOR SPERM PRODUCTION OR FOR SPIRM HEALTH SPERM HAVE ALL SORTS OF PROTINES IN THE CAP THINGS LIKE PENTRACTONS AND OTHER THINGS THAT CAUSE THEM TO SWIM FASTER WHEN THERE A EXPRESS PROPERLY IN IN THE RIGHT LOCATIONS AND HEAT ACTUALLY ALTERS THE LOCATION AND THE FUNCTION A LOT OF THOSE PROTINES THAR VERY HEAT SENSITIVE AND SO THAT'S WHY EXCESSIVE HEAT IS TRULY NOT GOOD FOR FERTILITY WHICH MAY BE INDEPENDENT OF HEATS ROLLS IN PROMOTING ESTROGEN OR TESTOSTRON O CASE SO NOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BREATHING LIGHT AND TEMPERATURE WE TALKED ABOUT PARENT HOOD WE TALKED ABOUT COMPETITION AND WE TALKED ABOUT SOME FARMON EFFECTS NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT PARTICULAR FORMS OF EXERCISE AND HOW THEY MODULATE THE STERID HARMONS AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT VARIOUS SUPPLEMENTS BOTH IN REFERENCE TO TESTOTRONE AND IN REFERENCE TO ESTROGEN SO NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW EXERCISE IN ITS VARIOUS FORMS WEIGHT TRAINING ENDURANCE WORK WEIGHT TRAINING TO FAILURE OR LESS INTENSE WEIGHT TRAINING CAN IMPACT TO STOSTRONE LEVELS BUT I WANTO REMIND YOU THERE WERE TALKG A OUT TO STOSTRONE BOTH IN MALES AND FEMALES AND BASED ON WHAT YOU KNOW FROM EARLIER IN THE EPISODE TO STOSTRONE CAN HAVE NUMEROUS PAUS OFE EFFECTS IN BOTH MALES IN FEMALES PROVIDED THERE AN OPTIMAL RANGE SO IF YOU LOOK ON THE WEB PEOPLE SAY O YOU KNOW TESTOSTRONE IS INCREASED BY WEIGHT TRAINING YOU ONTO BIG HEAVY COMPOUND MOVEMENT SQUATS AND DEAD LIFTS AND CINS AND THINGS OF THAT SORTH BUT WHAT ABOUT THE SCIENTIFIC STUDIES LIKE WHAT'S THE ACTUAL BASIS FOR THIS CAUSE IF YOU JUST TAKE A STEP BACK AND LOOK AT THIS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF SCIENC AS YOU TAKE A WHAT IS A SQUAT A SQUAT IS LOADING UP A BUNCH OF A WEIGHTS ON A BAR AND THEN YOU KNOW SITTING DOWN A CENTIALLY IN STANDING UP OVER AND OVER AGAIN OM WHAT'S A DEAD LIFT IT'S LIFTING HEAVY WEIHTS FROM THE GOUND WHY WOULD THAT INCREASE TOSTOSTRONE RIGHT THIS IS WHAT'S OFTEN NOT DISCUSSED IN THE WEIGHT TRAINING OR EVEN THE EXERCISE SCIENCE COMMUTIY WHAT WHAT WOULD ACTUALLY STIMULATE THE RELEASE OF TOSTOSTRONE FROM THE ADRENALS AND OR TESTIES AND WHICH ONE IS IT DRANALS OR TESTIES AR BOTH AND THAT'S OFTEN NOT DISCUSSED BUT AS A NERO SCIENTISTS IS THE KINDS OF THINGS WE THINK ABOUT AS WE THINK ALWAYS THAT GENES DON'T CREATE BEHAVIOR EMMUNE SYSTEMS DON'T KNOW WHEN TO BE ACTIVATED LUNGS DON'T KNOW WHEN TO INHALE OR EXALE HEARTS DON'T KNOW WHEN TO BE EXCEPT FOR THE INFORMATION THAT IT GETS FROM NURONS THE NERVOUS SYSTEM CONTROLS ALL OF THAT AND SO REALLY THE ANTS AR HAS TO BE IN THE NERAL SYSTEM THAT'S RELATED TO THESE PARTICULAR TYPES A WEIGHT BEARING EXERCISES SO WHEN YOU GO INTO THIS LITERATURE IT'S KIND OF HARD TO FIND REAL MECHANISM YOU SEE A LOT OF EFFACTS YOU'LL HEAR THINGS LIKE ANDROGEN RECEPTOR CONTENT MEANING TOSTOSTRONE AND ITS TERIVITOUS RECEPTOR CONTENT FALLING HEAVY RESISTANCE EXERCISE AND YOU FIND SOME EXAMPLES THAT FOR INSTANCE OM YOU KNOW THEY DO MUSCLE BYOPSEESE THEY CAN ACTUALLY SEE RECEPTOR INCREASES LOOKING AT EITHER HIGH VOLUME OR LOW VOLUME REALLY INTENSE EXERCISE AND YOU YOU CAN FIND A LOT OF THAT BUT NOT A LOT OF MECHANISM ABOUT HOW THE NERVOUS SYSTEM WOULD DO THIS AND THE REASON YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW IT CAN DO IT IS THAT YOU COULD POTENTIALLY BUILD BETTER PROTOCALLS OR FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT ABOUT THESE MOVEMENTS IS TRIGGERING INCREASES IN ANDROGEN RECEPTORS AND TOSTOSTRONE SO WHAT'S INTERESTING IS WHEN YOU START DIGGING INTO THE MORE MECHANISTIC STUDIES WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT HEAVY WEIGHT TRAINING SO THIS IS WEIGHT TRAINING WHERE THE THE SETS ARE DONE WITH ANYWHERE FROM YOU KNOW'T CIND ONE TO EIGHT REP RAN SO ITIS TRANSLATES DIFFERENTLY IN DEPENDING ON RASHO OF MUSCLE FYER TYPE AND SO FORTH BUT WHERE BUSILY PEOPLE ARE WORKING IT ANYWHERE FROM LIKE SEVENTY PER CENT TO NINETY FY PER CENT OF THEIR MAXIMUM OR SOMETIMES EVEN GOING RIGHT DOWN TO THEIR ONE REPETITION MAXIMUM REALLY CONT YOU DON'T MAX EFFORT WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT USING THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IN A WAY IN WHICH THER MOVING HEAVY LOAD SO THAT I WOULD TRANSLATE TO RECRUITMENT OF HIGH THRESHOLD MOTOR UNITS FOR YOU MUSCLE PHYSIOLOGIS AND THERE'S A RULE IN MUSCLE PHYSIOLOGY ABOUT THE NER NURON RECRUITMENT FOR MOVING MUSCLES WHERE YOU BASILY USE THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF MOTOR UNITS OF NURONS TO ACTIV AITE MUSCLE AS YOU POSCIBLY CANAS LOADS INCREASE YOU HAVE TO RECRUIT MORE ORD MORE NURONS IT'S IT YOU ALWYS HEARE ABOUT RECRUITING MUSCLE FIBRS BUT REALLY ITS RECRUIT NG MORE NURONS TO RECRUIT MORE MUSCLE FIBRES AND WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT HEAVY WIGHT TRAINING BUT NOT WEIGHT TRAINING TO FAILURE WHERE COMPLESION OF A REPETITION IS IN POSIBLE LEADS TO THE GREATEST INCREASES IN TESTOSTRON I'M SURE THERE A BUNCH OF EXERCISE JOKES OUT THERE THE DIGAN A DOU NOT COME AT ME WITH A UNCH OF THINGS WHEREO YA BUT HIGH VOLUME AND THIS AND TRAINING TO FAILURE AN THAT SURE AM IF YOU'RE WILLING TO KONT OF PUT THINGS SIDE BY SIDE ADJUST FOR AM EXOGENOUS TESTOSTRON TREATMENT HAND AL THETHE REST WHICH WAS DONE IN THESE STUDIES WHAT YOU FIND IN GENERAL IS THAT WEIGHT TRAINING WITH HEAVY LOADS SO ANYWHERE FROM ONE REMAXIMUM TO SOMEWHERE IN THE UNOSIXTY T REREPETITION RANGE IN MALES OR FEMALES INCREASES TESTOSTRONE SIGNIFICANTLY AND IT DOES IT FOR ABOUT A DAY SOMETIMES UP TO FORTY EIGHT HOURS AND THE STUDIES THAT I FOUND WHICH SEEM TO HOLD THE MOST RIGOR OR WEIGHT BASED ON WHERE THERE PUBLISHED DOES SUPPOSED BEING PUBLISH IN THE JOURNAL NEVER HEARD OF IT THEIR PUBLISHIN GOOD QUALITY EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY JOURNALS UM FOR INSTANCE THE PAPER BY RECT RATIMES ARE A T A M E S S AT ALL AM WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE WHICH TALKS ABOUT MODULATIONS IN ANDRGEN RECEPTOR CONTENT AFTER HAVING RESISTANCE EXERCISE LOOKS IT GOING TO FAILURE NOT TO FAILURE THE WORK OF A SKEREDO AT ALL PUBLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND SIX DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS OF STREING TRAINING LEADING TO FAILURE ORS IES NOT FAILURE ON HORMONA RESPONSOF STRENGTH AND POWER GAINS YOU KNOW THERE ARE LOT OF STUDIES HERE AND I WILL CERTAINLY PUT THE LINKS TO THESE IN THE CAPTION MANY OF THESE ACTUALLY INCLUDE DUNKAN FRENCH WHO RUNS TOE EFSY TRAINING CENTER WHO HAVE HAD THE THE PRIVILEGE OF MEETING AND DISCUSSING SOME OF THIS WITH BEFORE AM AS WELL AS OTHER AUTHORS OF COURSE BUT THEY ALL POINT TO THE FACT THAT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE ENGAGEMENT OF THE NURONS THAT RECRUIT HIGH THRESHOLD MOTOR UNITS IN MOCELE WHEN MOVING HEAVY LOADS BUT NOT TO FAILURE THAT HAS TO PROVIDE SOME SORT OF FEED BACK SIGNAL EITHER TO THE GO NAD TO PRODUCE MORE TESTOSTRON OR IS INCREASING THE ACTIVITY OF RECEPTERS IN THE BODY NOW WHY DO I SAY THAT WELL THIS IS THE PUZZLE RIGHT HOW IS IT THAT A PARTICULAR MOVEMENT JUST LIKE HOW IS IT THE INTIRACTING WITH YOUR CHILD IS INCREASING OR DECREASING TESTOSTRO THIS IS THE KIND OF FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION AT THE MECHANISTIC LEVEL AND WE ANSWER THE QUESTION FOR CHILD REARING HAS PROBABLY SOMETHING TO DO WITH SMELL AND FERMONS ALTHOUGH I'M SURE THEIR OTHER CUS AS WELL BUT THERE'S CLEARLY A INFLUENCE OF HARD WORK AT THE NURAL LEVEL AND THEN AT THE MUSCULAR LEVEL FOR INCREASING TESTOSTRONE AND THERE'S ALSO CLEARLY IN EFFACT OF WORKING TOO HARD AN PRESUMABLY INCREASING QUART IS ALL TOO MUCH ALTHOUGH I'M SPECULATING THERE IN TERMS OF REDUSING TESTOSTRONE AND SO THE REASON WERE GETTING KNITTY GRITTY ABOUT THIS IS BECAUSE ULTIMATELY WE'D REALLY LIKE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE THE OPTIMO PROTOCOLS YOU KNOW OUT THERE IN THE LARGE URE YOU HEAR MOVE HEAVY OBJECTS TO INCREASE TESTASTRONE SOME OF THAT WILL BE CONVERTED TO THE MORE POWERFUL ANDURGEN D GHH T BY FIVE OUT RODUCTAS ET CETERA BUT WE REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND YET HOW THESE PARTICULAR BEHAVIORS INCREASE TESTOTRON A WHETHER NOT ITS DOING THAT BY MOGULING THE RECEPTERS OR ITS MOGLING TOSTOSTRONE RELEASE DIRECTLY PRESUMELY TOSTOSTRON RELEASE DIRECTLY AND SENSITIVITY OF THE RECEPTORS THAT'S WHAT MOST OF THE MUSCLE PHYSIOLOGIES STUDIES THAT I WAS ABLE TO FIND POINT TO BUT THIS BASICLLY BOILS DOWN TO A PARTICULAR SET OF PROTOCOLS WHERE IF YOU WANT TO INCREASE TESTOSTRONE FOR WHATEVER REASON THAT WEIGHT TRAINING WITH HEAVY LOADS BUT NOT TO FAILURE SEEMS TO BE THE BEST SUPPORTED AT LEAST SCIENTIFICALLY SUPPORTED SOLUTION TO THAT NOW IT MAY NOT RAISE YOUR TESTOSTRON LEVELS AS HIGH AS YOU WANT BUT ITS DEVINLY TAKING THINGS IN THE CORRECT DIRECTION NOW MANY OF YOU MIGHT BE ENDURANCE ATHLETS OR ALSO INJOY EXERCISE BESISES HEAVY WEIGHT BEARING EXERCISE AND THERE ARE SEVERAL STUDIES EXPLORING WHETHER OR NOT INDURANCE ACTIVITY CAND INCREASE OR DECREASE ANDROGEN LEVELS AND WHETHER NOT YOU COMBINE ENDURANCE ACTIVITY AND WEIGHT TRAINING WHETHER NOT THAT HAS ANY EFFECT IF YOU DO THE ENDURANCE ACTIVITY FIRST OR SECOND AND THE TAKE AWAY FROM ALL OF THIS WAS THAT INDURANCE ACTIVITY IF PERFORMED FIRST LEADS TO DECREASES IN TESTOSTRONE DURING THE WEIGHT TRAINING SESTION AS COMPARED TO THE SAME WEIGHT TRAINING SESSION DONE FIRST FOLLOWED BY ENDURANCE ACTIVITY IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU ONA OPTOMIZE TOSTOSTRONE LEVELS IT SEEMS TO BE THE CASE THAT WEIGHT TRAINING FIRST AND DOING CARDIOTYPE ENDURANCE ACTIVITY AFTERWARD IS THE RIGHT ORDER OF BUSINESS NOW WHEN THESE ARE DONE ON SEPARATE DAYS IT DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE AN EFFECT THAT IT IS THEY SHOWED NO STATISTICAL INTERACTION BUT IT SEEMS THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO THESE IN THE SAME WORK OUT EPISODE THAT ITS MOVE HEAVY LOADS FIRST THEN DO CARDIOVASCULAR EXERCISE SO THERE'S A LITTLEBIT OF DATA LOOKING SPECIFICALLY HOW ENDURANCE EXERCISE IMPACTS TOSTSTRONE AND ITS DURIVITIVES AND IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT HIGH INTENSTHE INTERVAL TRAINING SPRINTING ET CETERA WHICH SOMEWHAT MIMICS THE NURRAL ACTIVITY THAT OCCURS WHILE MOVING HEAVY WEIGHT LOADS IS GOING TO INCREASE TESTOSTRONE THERE'S AMPLE EVIDENCE FOR THAT  IN THE LITERATURE AND THAT NDURANCE EXERCISE THAT EXTENDS BEYOND SEVENTY FIVE MINUTES IS GOING TO START TO LEAD TO REDUCTIONS INTOSTOSTRON PRESUMELY BY INCREASES IN CARTIS ALL BUT OF COURSE THE INTENSITY OF THE EXERCISE IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT TOO IN KNOW NO ONE EVER I DON'T THINK ANY ONE REALLY BELIEVES THAT HIGHKING FOR THE THREE HOURS IS GOING REDUSER TOSTOSRON IT WHEREAS I THINK IF ONE WERE TO GO OUT AND RUN HARD FOR THREE HOURS THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE THE REDUCTIONS IN TESTSTRONE BY WAY OF INCREASES IN QUARTIS ALL AND SO WHILE THIS ARIA CERTAINLY NEEDS MORE RESEARCH IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT LIMITING THE ENDURANCE EXERCISE TO SEVENTY FIVE MINUTES OR LESS NOT MAKING IT TWO INTENTS IS ONE WAY TO KEEP CORTIS ALL FROM GOING THROUGH THE ROOF BUT I'VE TALKED ON PREVIOUS EPISODES AND THERE A LOT OF OTHERS WHO HAVE TALKED OUT THERE ABOUT HOTI CLAMP CORTIS LL HOW TO KEEP CORTISAL MORE REDUCED THIS IS ALSO ONE OF THE REASONS WHY YOU CAN IMAGIN THAT VARIOUS INDIVIDUALS EITHER FOR COMPETITION OR JUST FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES ARE RELY ON TESTOSTRONE THERAE EXOGENIST O STOSTRONE NOT JUST FOR WEIGHT TRAINING BUT FOR ENDURANCE EXERCISE SO THIS ONE O THE REASONS WHY EVERYONES IN A WHILE PROFESSIONAL PSYCHOLISTS ILL GET POPPED FOR PERFORMANCE IN HASIN DRUGS MEAN THEY'LL GET CAUGHT AND IT'S NOTCIOUS THAT THEIR INCREASING RED BLOOD SELLS THROUGH EPIO AN THINGS THAT SORT OFTENTIMES THEIR ALSO TAKING TESTOSTR NOT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE LARGE OR HAVE MASSIVELY HYPERTROPHE MUSCLES BUT BECAUSE THEY BECAUSE THEIR INJECTING TESTOSTRONE THEY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT QUARTES ALL INDUCE REDUCTIONS IN TESTOSTERON THEY CAN JUST CLAMP OR KEEP THEIR TESTOSTRONE LEVELS HIGH NOT SOMETHING I'M RECOMMENDING BUT I'M JUST JUSTIFYING THE RASTRONAL FOR WHINE ENDURANCE ATHLETE WOULD WANT TO DO THAT AT ALL SONOWLET SWITCH OVER TO TALKING ABOUT ESTROGEN SO THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO OPTIMIZE THEIR ESTROGEN LEVELS AND ONE OF THE PLACES WHERE THIS SHOWS UP A LOT AND I GET A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT IS MENOPAUS SO MENOPAUSES I MENTION EARLIER IS THIS FEIRLY MASSIVE REDUCTION IN THE AMOUNT OF ESTROGEN THAT ANT IS CIRCULATING IN ONE'S BLOOD MAINLY BECAUSE THE OVERY IS NOW DEPLETED OF SOME ASTROGEN PRODUCTION OF ITS OWN THE EGGS ARE NOT BEING PRODUCED THEYVE BEN DEPLETED ET CETERA SO MENOPAS IS CHARACTERIZED BY A VARIETY OF SYMPTEMS AND IT'S MULTIFACITED PROBABLY DESERVES AN ENTIRE EPISODE ON ITS OWN BUT THINGS LIKE HOT FLASHES THINGS LIKE MOOD SWINGS THINGS LIKE HEADACHES IN PARTICULAR MIGRAIN HEADACHES THERE CAN BE A LOT OF BRAIN FOG IT CAN BE VERY VERY DESRUPTIVE FOR PEOPLE NOW USE SOMEITS HERE BY ANDREW PAWS WHICH IS THOUGHT TO BE THE KIND OF ANALOGUE TO TO MENOPAS BUT MENOPAUS HAS CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS THAT MAKE IT A VERY ROBUS PHENOMENON FOR MOST WOMEN WHEREAS FOR MEN ANDRIPAUS IS GOING TO SOMETIMES HAPPENS SOMETIMES WONT IN FACT WITHOUT GOING INTO THE DETAILS OF THE THE GRAPHS AND THE AND THE DATA IT'S VERY CLEAR AS I MENTION EARLIER THAT SOME MEN MAINTAIN LEVELS OF OF CIRCULATING ANDROGENS THAT ARE QUITE HIGH EVEN AS SIMILARS THEY WERE IN PUBERITY AND THEIR TENIARS AND TWENTIES WELL IN TO THEIR SIXTY SEVENIES AND EIGHTIES IF THEIR OPTIMIZING A LOT OF OTHER THINGS AND PROBABLY GENETIC PLAYS A ROLE AS WELL WHEREAS SOME MALES WON'T BUT WITHIN THE FEMALE POPULATION OR POPULATION OF INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE OVERIES THERE'S A VERY STEROTYPED IN CHARACTERISTIC REDUCTION IN ESTROGEN LEVELS AS THE NUMBER OF EGGS BECOMES TO PLEADED AND THAT'S WHAT WE THINK OF AS MENOPAUS SO WHAT ARE THE VARIOUS THINGS THAT ONE CAN DO FOR MENOPAS WELL ONE OF THE MOST COMMON ONES IS THAT PHYSICIANS WILL PROSCRIBE SUPPLEMENTAL ESTROGEN SO THIS IS HORMON THERAPY WHERE SOMEBODY TAKES EITHETHER OR ALESTROGEN OR THEY'LL TAKE IT THERE USE A PATCH OR A PELLET SOME WAY TO SECRE ESTRODIAL INTO THE SYSTEM AND THAT HAS VERYING SUCCESS DEPENDING ON THE INDIVIDUALS SOME PEOPLE RESPON VERY WELL TO IT OTHER P OPLE REALLY HAVE CHALLENGES WITH IT AND THER A LOT OF SIDE AFFECTS ASSOCIATE WITH IT FOR SOME PEOPLE NOT OTHERS IN ADDITION THERE IS A CONCERN ALWAYS ABOUT SUPPLEMENTING ESTROGEN WHEN THERE'S A BREAST CANCER A BACKGROUND IN THE FAMILY OR THERE'S CONCERN ABOUT BREASCANCOR FOR ANY REASON BECAUSE A LOT OF THOSE CANCERS ARE ESTROGEN DEPENDENT AND THAT'S WHY DRUGS LIKE TOMOXOPHIN AND A NASTROSALL AND DRUGS THAT BLOCK EITHER A ROMATASE OR BLOCK AND ESCUSE ME ESTROGEN RECEPTORS DIRECTLY WERE TO WERE INITIALLY DEVELOPED YOU SEE THEM A LOT ON THE INNER NAT AGAIN FOR THE THE SPORTS FOLKS WHO ARE TRYING TO INCREASE THE STOSERUN REDUCE ESTROGEN BUT REMEMBER THOSE DRUGS WERE INITIALLY DEVELOPED AS WAYS TO PREVENT ESTROGEN BINDING TO THE ESTROGEN RECEPTOR AS CANCER TREATMENTS SO ON'T BE VERY CLEAR AND I'VE SAID THIS MAN TIMES WE ALWAYS PUT IN THE IN THE CAPTION OF EACH EPISODE OF COURSE THAT I'M NOT A PHYSITION NOT EMDY I DON'T PRESCRIBE ANYTHING OF A PROFESSOR AND PROFESS THINGS I'M HERE TO TRANSLATE THE SCIENTIFIC LURTUR AND POINT TO WHAT MIGHT BE SOME USEFUL AVENUES FOR EXPLORATION BUT THIS JUST FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES YOU SHOULD DEFONLY TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT ANYTHING HAT I'M TONING ABOUT NOW OR IN ANY EPISODE FOR THAT MATTER SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE LITERATURE ON MENOPAUS OUTSIDE OF JUST STANDARD ESTROGEN PHERAPY THERE ARE SOME VERY INTERESTING COMPOUNDS OUT THERE THAT HAVE BEEN USED AND THAT ARE SUPPORTED BY QUALITY PURE REVIEWED STUDIES AND AGAIN I'LL WERE FREE ONCE AGAIN TO THIS AMAZING WEBSITE EXAMINED OT COM WHERE YOU CAN PUT IN ESSENTIALLY ANY CONDITION OR ANY SUPPLEMENT AND ITWL POINT YOU TO THE HUMAN EFFECT MATRICS NOT ANIMAL STUDIES BUT HUMAN STUDIES THAT HAVE EXPLORED THESE THINGS NOW THERE ARE HUGE VARIETY OF THEM HERES BUT  SO I WON'T GO INTO ALL OF THEM BUT SOME OF THE THE PRO ESTROGENIC COMPOUNDS THA SHOWN TO BE POWERFUL IN THE CONTECT OF MENOPAUS AS WELL AS OTHER CONDITIONS WHERE ESTROGEN IS LOWER THAN ONE WOULD LIKE INCLUDE A DESCRIPTION AND SOME OF THE LIRCALL GET INTO THIS A MOMENT OF SOMETHING LIKE BLACK COHOSCH I THINK THAT'S THE CORRECT PRONUNCIATION IT'S LITERALLY THE WORD BLACK AND THEN C O H O S H AND IT'S VERY INTERESTING THERE ARE THIRTEEN PUREVIEWED STUDIES THAT HAVE REACHED PROMINENCE IN THE KIND OF COMMERCIAL LANDSCAPE WHERE THIS SUBSTANCE BLACK COHUSH HAS BEEN PROMOTED AS A WAY TO INCREASE ESTROGEN TURNS OUT THAT THE EFFECTS ARE CONSISTENT BUT ARE FAIRLY MINER FAIRLY MINOR INCREASES IN ESTROGEN SO DOES SEEM TO BE A REAL EFFECT OF IT IS SIGNIFICANT OVER THE PLOCEBO EFFECT BUT THERE IS ALSO SIGNIFICANT PLOCEBO EFFECT OM IN SOME OF THESE STUDIES AS WELOP SO WHAT'S INTERESTING WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE STUDIES IS THAT A MANY OF THEM WERE CARRIED OUT OVER A PERIOD OF YOU KNOW SIX PLUSMONTS THEIR DOUBLE BLIND STUDIES ET CETERA AND ALMOST ALL OF THEM LED TO MODEST INCREASES IN ESTRGEN AND MODEST DECREASES IN MENOPAUS RELATED S MPTOMS NOW A FEW ADDITIONAL DETAILS ABOUT THESE STUDIES THEY WERE GENERALLY CARRIED OUT ON WOMEN AGE FORTY FIVE TO SIXTY FOUR IN SOME CASES THEY A LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT WOMEN THAT WERE CLINICALLY OBES IR OVERWEIGHT ALTHOUGH NOT ALWAYS M THE SUBJECT SIZE POOLS ARE PRETTY BIG YOU KNOW ANYWHERE FROM YOU KNOW FIFTY TO EIGHTY SEVEN THESE ARE DECENT SIZE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO SUBJECTS ET CETERA SO THESE LOOK TO BE LIKE QUALITY STUDIES AND THEY BASELY POINT TO THE FACT THAT BLACK COSH CAN HAVE A MODEST IN A FACT IN IMPROVING MANAPAUS SYMPTOMS THE OTHER ONE IS PANAX GINSANG SO P AN A AT A EX GINSANG HAS BEEN SHOWN TO DECRESE SUMSYMPTOMS ASSOCIATE WITH MANOPAUS MOSTLY RELATED TO LEBIDO ALTHOUGH THE OTHER EFFECTS WERE UNRELIABLE OTHER THINGS LIKE MAKA WHICH IS KNOWN TO INCREASE DOPOMINE ACTUALLY HAD MINOR EFFECTS THINGS LIKE THE NAMES HERE LOTWLE HARD TO PRONOUNCE SO FORGIVING THINGS LIKE A VALARIANA OFISIONALIS UM HAS SHOWN THAT THERE CAN BE SOME IMPROVEMENT IN THE HOT FLASH SYMPTOMS AND SOME OF THE INSOMNIA SSOCIATE WITH THAT SO THAT MIGHT BE WORTH A EXPLORING AGAIN DISCUSS WITH YOUR DOCTOR BUT TESE WERE BOTH U IN A HUNDRED SUBJECT PLUS AM AGE FORTY FIVE TO SIXTY FOUR INDIVIDUALS DOUBLE BLIND PLOCEBO CONTROLLED STUDIES THAT SHOWED SIGNIFICANT BUT MODEST EFFECTS THERE WAS ONE SUBSTANCE IN THE GALERI OF THE OF THE A COMPOUNDS THAT WAS LOOKED AT U THAT TURNS OUT TO BE PARTICULARLY INTERESTING AND THIS ONE IS ALSO PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT TO PRONOUNCE AND ITS A PRURARIA MIRIF MIRA FIKA SOMAN SPELL THIS OUT FOR YOU ITS P U E R A R I A PURARIA MIRIF MIRI FIKA M I R I F I C A AND THEIR FOUR STUDIES ON THIS COMPOUND THAT SHOW IN EVERY CASE IT TO BE VERY POTENT IN FACT COMPARABLE TO ESTEROGEN THERAPY ESTRGEM REPLACEMENT THERAPY IN REDUCING THE SYMPTOMS OF MANAPAUS THIS WAS PRETTY STRIKING BECAUSE WHEN YOU GO THROUGH THESE STUDIES YOU LOOK AGAIN THAT THEY SEEM TO BE U PRETTY WELL CONTROLLED AS FAR AS I COULD TELL UM AND THEY EXPLORED A PRETTY WIDE SUBJECT POOL UM AND IT SEEMS THAT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE STUDIES WHEN LOOKING SIDE BY SIDE AT A PURARIA MIRFICA WHICH IS ALSO CALLED NALIS REALLY ARD TO PRONOUNCE QUAU CUR COW UM I GUESS THAT'S AT THE NAME THAT THEY USING UM IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES UM THAT IT WAS COMPARABLE TO ESTEROGEM REPLACEMENT THERAPY SO I MENTION THIS BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE CONTACT TO ME AND SAID WHAT ABOUT THE INSOMNIA IN MANAPAUS WHAT ABOUT THE HEADACHES IN MANAPAS NOW I'M NOT SUGGESTING YOU RUN OUT AND AME ATLEAST ARE TAKING ANY OF THESE COMPOUNCE PLEASE TALK HERE DOCTOR YOU KNOW ANY HORMON RELATED COMPOUND IS A SERIOUS CONSIDERATION A BECAUSE OF TH RELATIONSHIP TO BREST CANCERS BUT JUST IN GENERAL THESE COMPOUNDS ARE ESTROGEN INTO STOSTERON AR EXCEEDINGLY POWERFUL INTERMS OF CONTROLLING OUR MENTAL AND PHYSICAL AM STATES AND SO YOU WANT TO APPROACH THEM WITH CAUTION BUT I THOUGHT THAT THAT ONE IN PARTICULAR WAS INTERESTING AND FOR WHICH THERE QUITE A FEW PUBMED A DOCUMENTED PURE REVIEWED STUDIES IN QUALITY JOURNALS O CASTONOW LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ROLE OF SPECIFIC COMPOUNDS SOME OF WHICH MANY OF WHICH CAN BE TAKEN IN SUPPLEMENTATION FORM OR EXTRACTED FROM DI NUTRICION IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE SEXTORICD HARMONS AND AGAIN I JUST WANT O EMPHASIZE THAT I'M NOT SUGGESTING ANYONE TAKE ANYTHING OR STOP TAKING ANYTHING THIS IS PURELY FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES BUT SOME OF THE DAT ON THESE IS QUITE STRIKING AND IMPRESSIVE IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT CERTAIN COLLECTIONS OF NUTRIENTS ARE USEFUL FOR PROMOTING TESTSTERONE AND ESTERGEM PRODUCTION IN THEIR PROPER RATIOS AND THOSE THINGS ARE WHAT I WOULD CALL THE SORT OF USUAL SUSPECTS VITEM INDE WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR SO MANY BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS IN CLUDING INDICRAN FUNCTIONS ZINC MAGNESIUM ET CETERA AND IF YOU WANT TO LOOK INTO THIS MORE DEEPLY YOU AN'T UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS ARE OF NOT HAVING SUFFICIENT ZINC MAGNESIUM AND WHAT THOSE LEVELS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE THERE'S A PAPER THAT'S AVAILABLE YOU GO ON PUBMED AM I CAN'T PRONOUNCE THIS LAST NAME I'M SARI IT'S A IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE WORZOSIC BUT IT'S W ARE ZE O S E K I HOPE BUT IN BUTCHER THAT TO BADLY UM WERE ZOSEC AT ALL TWENTY TWENTY IN ENDERCHRONOLOGY AND METABOLISM REVIEW SO THIS A RECENT PAPER IN A GOOD PURE REVIEW JOURNAL IT TALKS MAINLY ABOUT HOW THE HYPOTHOLAMIC PATUITARYA DRENAL AXIS ON THE SEX STORIED HORMONS ARE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY DEFICIENCIES IN MAGNESIUM DEFICIENCIES INVIEEMAND AND DEFICIENCIES IN ZINC HOWEVER THAT DOESN'T POINT TO THE LEVELS THAT ONE SHOULD TAKE IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE SO IT DOESN'T SAY TAKE EXAMOUNT OF ZINCOR EXAMOUNT OF MAGNESIUM OR EXAMOUNT OF BI TOMEND FOR THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE IT'S SO CONTEXT DEPENDENT AN INDIVIDUAL DEPENDENT A HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU GO TO EXAMINE D OT CALM YOU CAN PUT IN ZINCHR MAGNESIUM IN VITEEMINDEAND THEY WILL GIVE YOU RANGES OF DOSAGES THAT ARE SUPPORTED BY SPECIFIC STUDIES AGAIN THAT INFORMATION IS COMPLETELY FREE TO YOU AND IT'S VERY USEFUL IN FIGURING THAT OUT I PERSONALLY HAVE SUPPLEMENT OF I ZINC MAGNESIUM IN VITEMAN D FOR YEARS UM AND BUT MANY OTHER PEOPLE DO THAS WELL THE QUESTION IS ALWAYS HOW MUCH AND THAT'S WHY IM A PROPONEN OF GETTING BLOOD WORK DONE BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW WHETHER NOT YOURE ANDROGEN LEVELS AS WELL AS THINGS LIKE BYTOMEND LEVELS ET CETERA ARE A SUFFICIENTLY HIGH SO THAT TAKE AWAY FROM THESE STUDIES LOOKING AT WHAT DEFICIENCIES CAUSE IN TERMS OF DEPHASISTS AN TESTOSTERON AND ESTROGENT REALLY POINT IN THE DIRECTION OF MAKE SURE YOU'RE GETTING ADEQUATE ZINC MAGNESIUM AN D THREE UNLESS YOU WANT THESE ASTERID HORMONE LEVELS TO BE REDUCED FOR WHATEVER REASON ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S BEEN SHOWN TIME AND TIME AGAIN TO HAVE VERY NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON SEX STORIED HARMONS TESTOSTRON MAINLY MEN ESTROGEN MAINLY IN WOMEN IS OPIOIDS THERE'S AS WHOLE ISSUE OF COURSE OF THE THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC O ITS DESERVING OF ENTIRE EPISODE WE ARE GOIN TO TALK ABOUT A THAT WITH A EXPERTS INEDICTION A AND PEOPLE THAT TREAT PAIN AND SO FORTH BUT THE OPIOIDS DRAMATICALLY REDUCE LEVELS OF TESTSTRONE AND ESTROGEN AND THEY DO THAT MAINLY BY DISRUPTING THE RECEPTORS ON CANATITROPAN RELEASING HORMON NURONS THESE NURONS WITHIN THE HYPOTHALMUS THAT COMMUNICATE TO THE PATUITARY AND IN FACT PEOPLE THAT TAKE LARGE AMOUNTS OF OPIODS OR EVEN TAKE LOW LEVELS OF OPIOIDS FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME WI'LL DEVELOP ALL SORTS OF ENDRCRIN SINDERUMS THAT'S BEEN SHOWN OVER AND OVER AGAIN GONICOMASCIOR MAL BRES DEVELOPMENT IN MALES DESTRUPTIONS TO THE OVERY AND FEMALES IT'S REALLY A A QUITE TERRIBLE SITUATION SO A EXCESSIVE OPOIDS ARE VERY PROBLEMATIC FOR SEXTORD HARMONS I DON'T THINK A ANY ONE WILL HAVE ANY TROUBLE A FINDING ANY LITERATURE ON THAT YOU CAN JUST GOINGTO PUBMED YOU CAN PUT A OPIOIDS TESTOSTRON OR OPIOIDS A ESTROGEN A BUT THE MAJOR EFFECT IS ACTUALLY WAY UP IN THE HYPOTHALEMUS TO SHUT DOWN THE PRODUCTION OF GENERAGE THE VERY HORMON THAT STIMULATES TESTOSTRON AND ESTROGEN RELEASE NOW THERE'S AN ENTIRE INDUSTRY DEVOTED TO SUPPLEMENTS AND VARIOUS THINGS THAT PEOPLE CAN TAKE TO INCREASE TESTOSTRONE SOME OF WHICH HAVE SCIENTIFICTATA TO SUPPORT THEM A SOME OF WHICH DO NOT AND SOME OF WHICH HAVE ANEDOTAL SUPPORT AND SOME OF WHICH DO NOT THIS RANGE IS SO BROADLY I MAN THINGS LIKE A THE MATERIAL OFFDEER ANTLERS WHICH IS HIGH AN SUPPOSEDLY IGIEF ONE WHICH IS IN THE GROWTHHORMON PATHWAY A ALL THE WOID TO A ACTUAL OF CONSUMPTION OF BULLTESTIES THEIRE YOU CAN GO ON AMAZON RIGHT NOW I CERTAINLY DON'T SUGGEST THE UDUCEING YOUCAN ACTUALLY BY A GROUND UP TESTIS FRO FROM A CAWS A AND YOU CAN CONSUME THOSE ANO LA THATS CAN BE BROKEN DOWN IN THE GOT AM CERTAINLY NOT A SUGGESTING DO THAT BUT JUST TO POINT OUT THIS IS A HUGE AND VAST LITERATURE AND ASHY DATES BACK HUNDREDS OF YEARS EVEN THOUGH TESTOSTRONE WASN'T DISCOVERED WHAN A THAT LONG AGO AS A SPECIFIC HORMON MOLECUEL AND CHARACTERIZED AND THEN RESYNTHESIZED IT HAS A HUGE INDUSTRY BECAUSE OF THE POWERFUL EFFECTS THAT IT HAS LIKEWISE WITH ESTROGEN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BIRTH CONTROL PILL WAS ONLY MADE POSSIBLE BY UNDERSTANDING THE STRUCTURE OF ESTROGEN AND ESTRODIL AND WERENOTOCAL ABOUT BIRST CONTROL AND HOW IT WORKS AND ITS INFLUENCE ON VERIOUS OTHER PATHWAYS IN A FUTURE EPISODE BUT THERE ARE THESE SUPPLEMENT COMPOUNDS THAT ARE SUPPORTED BY THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE IN TERMS OF THEIR ABILITY TO ADJUST ANDROGENS THINGS LIKE TESTOSTRONE AND DIHYDROTESTSTRONE ONE OF THE ONES THAT HAS REALLY GOOD EVIDENCE FOR IT IS CREATINE IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT SOMETHING ABOUT CREATINE ALTHOUGH THE MECHANISM ISN'T EXACTLY CLEAR EITHER INCREASES FIVE ALFOR A DUCTASTE OR MAKES THE TESTOSTRO MOLECULE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO CERTAIN ANDS A ENSIMATIC REACTIONS THAT LEADS TO INCREASES IN D H T D H T TO HADRTESTOSTRONE AS I MENTION THE PREVIOUS EPISODE HAS IS DRAMATIC ROLL IN CREATING A AKIND OF MASCULINIZATION OF THE BRAIN PRENATALY IT ALSO A DEFINES THE PRIMARY SEX CHARACTERISTIC OF THE GROWTH OF THE PINUS ET CETERA AND BEYOND INFANC AND EARLY CHILDHOOD AND LATER IN LIFE IT HAS POWERFUL EFFECTS IN CREATING BALDING IN BEARD GROWTH ET CETERA AND IT HAS A MUCH HIGHER AFFINITY FOR THE ANDROGEN RECEPTER THAN DOES TESTOSTRON SO CREATINE CAN INCREASE T H T WHICH MEANS THAT IF YOU TAKE CREATINE AND YOUR VERY D H T SUSCEPTIBLE THAN YOU MIGHT EXPERIENCE SOME HEIR LOSS HAT HAS BEEN HEAVILY DEBATE IT DOES CREATINE CASBALDNESS IT'S GON O DEPEND IT'S GON DEPEND ON HOW MUCH FIVE OL FOR DUCTAES YOU HAVE AND HOW PRONE TO HEIRLOS YOU ARE ON SOME PEOPLE CAN TAKE CREATINE WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM IN TERMS OF HAIRLOST SOME PEOPLE CANNOT THEY START LOSING THA HEIR ON TO LEVELS THAT AT LEAST FOR THEM A AREN'T COMFORTABLE THERE ARE A FEW OTHER THINGS THAT CAN INCREASE TESTOSTRON AND IT HAS TO DO WITH THE WAY THAT TESTOSTRONE EXIST IN ITS FREE AND ITS BOUND FORM SO TOESTOSTRONE THE MOLECULE IS GOT A TOTAL TESTOSTRON THAT'S USUALLY WHAT'S MEASURED THIS IS THE KIND OF LEVELS OF THAT ARE TYPICALLY THROWN AROUND OF ANYWHERE FROM THREE HUNDRED AND NINE HUNDRED BEING THE COND OF NATURAL RANGE AND THEN SUPERPHYSIOLOGICAL GETTING UP INTO TWELVE HUNDRED SIXTEEN HUNDRED RANGE BUT TESTOSTRONE ISN'T JUST ROAMING AROUND FREE IN THE BLOOD AT LEAST MOST OF IT ISN'T MOST OF IT IS BOUND TO EITHER SEX HORMON BINDING GLOBULANE S H B G OR TO ALBUMEN THEY THEYRE NEEDED AS TRANSPORTERS TO GET TESTOSTRON IN TE CELLS SO THAT TESTOSTRON CAN HAVE ITS EFFECTS ON GENE EXPRESSION AS WELL AS OTHER A PATHWAYS WITHIN THEMSELVES SO PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THAT THE LEVEL OF FREE TESTOSTRONE IS REALLY WHAT'S IMPORTANT AND TAT YOU WANT TO OPTIMIZE FREE TESTOSTRO THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A TRICKY STATEMENT THAT'S KIND OF LIKE A A IT'S IT'S TRUE AND YET IT'S NOT REALLY A REFLECTIVE OF A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THESE BINDING GLOBULAN'S WORK REMEMBER THESE BINDING LOBULANTS AREN'T THERE TO SOAK UP ALL YOUR TESTOSTRON JUST TO MAKE IT HARD FOR YOU TO FREE UP TESTOSTRON AND YOU KNOW A MAKE GAINS IN THE GM OR WHATEVER IS WHERE HAVE INCREASES IN LOBIDO THERE THERE TO ACTUALLY TRANSPORT TESTOSTRON TO TO SPECIFIC TISSUES TO SHUTTLE THEM TO SPECIFIC TISSUES AND TO SET THE RATE OF BOUND AND UNBOUND TESTOSTRONS SO THAT IT'S NOT ALL UNBOUND AT ONCE AND YOU KNOW THAT IT'S A ALWAYS INTERESTING TO LOOK IN THE LITERATURE AND SEE HOWEVER IN WANTS TO FREE UP THEIR TESTOSTRONS THAT CAN WORK BUT SEXTORMON BINING GLOBULANE CAN BIND UP TOO MUCH TESTOSTRO TO THE POINT WHERE ITS HAVING NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON LOBIDO OR ON ON MUSCLE GROWTH IN FAT LOSS IN THINGS THAT SORTNESS IS TRUE IN MALES AND FEMALES OR AM IT CAN BE DOING EXACTLY WHAT IT' SUPPOSED TO DO WHICH IS SHUDTLING TESTOSTRONE TO THE PROPER A TISSUES IN ORGANS WHERE IT HAS ALL THESE EFFACTS INCLUDING THE BRAIN SO AM THT THERE ARE SUPPLEMENTS IN PARTICULAR TONGA ALI WHICH IS HAS THIS OTHER NAME IT SOME TIME CALLED TONGOT AL SOMETIMES IT'S CALLED AN THESE AF FORGIVE ME THATS ARE TO PRONOUNCE BUT R E RI KOMA A LONGIFOLIA JACK THAY ALWAYS SEEM TO HAVE THESE NAMES THAT KIND OF A THAT KIND OF A ALLUDE TO ANDROGENIC FEATURES LIKE I DON'T KNOW WHY LONGIFOLIA GAC I DON'T KNOW I ITHING IT'S KIND OF OBVIOUS WHY AM THAT SOME SORT OF ANDROGENIC AM  THIS HAS BEEN SHOWN IN SEVERAL STUDIES AND YOU CAN FIND THESE ON EXAMINED OT COMER YOU CAN GO TO PUBMET IF YOU LIKE I'VE LOOKED TAT THESE THAT IT DOES SEEM TO HAVE SOME PRO FERTILITY PRO FREE TESTASTRONE AND SUBTLE APRODIGIAC EFECTS IT DOES ALSO SEEM TO BE A SLIHT ANTI ESTROGEN SO AM THE REPORTS TO THIS O PEOPLE TAKE THIS ANYWHERE FROM FOUR HUNDRED EIGHT HUNDRED MILEGRAMS TO DAY GAN I'M NOT SUGGESTING YOU DO THAT BUT THAT'S HOF WHAT'S OUT THERE AND THERE IS SOME DECENT SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE A TO SUPPORT THE FACT THAT IT LIBERATE SOME OF THE BOUND TESTOSTRONE AND ALLOWS MORE FREE TESTOSTRONE TO BE AVAILABLE SOME OF THE REPORTED QUOTING QOSID EFFECTS ARE THINGS LIKE A EXCESS OF ALERTNESS AND IN SOMNA IF IT'S TAKEN TOO LATE IN THE DAY AND SO FORTH BUT I ENCOURAGE YOU TO EXPLORE THAT FURTHER IF IF THAT'S AM SOME IF IT INCREASING FREETESTOSTRONE OF SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN DOING A EXAMINED OT COM INCLUDES A LOT OF OTHER AM THINGS THAT CAN INCREASE TESTASTRONE AM ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S BEEN PURPORTED TO FREE UP TESTOSTRONE IN THE BLOOD ARE THINGS LIKE NETTLES STINGING NETTLES A ALTHOUGH I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT THE LIERTURE POINTS TO STINGING NETTLE ALSO HAVING SOME A FAIRLY POTENT EFFECTS ON THE PROSTATE N ON ON THE LIVER AND SO IT MIGHT BE A TRICKY MOLECULE MAY BE NOT AN ATTRACTIVE ONE FOR FOR PEOPLE TO TAKE SO WE TALKED ABOUT CREATING WE TALKED ABOUT TONGA ALI IT'S CLEAR THAT BOREON WHICH IS REALLY INTERESTING BELIEVE AN I THINK BOREON COMES FROM A THNG THESE REALIKE METEORS THAT LANDED ON EARTH THAT NOW THE EXTRACT BOREON IT'S A YOU KNOW ONE OF THESE CRAZY STORIES THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT YOU G HOW CAN THAT POSSIBLY BE BUTHERE'S ACTUALLY A THAT'S OUT WORKS THAT AM BOREON THERE SOME SCIENTIFIC SUPPORT FOR IT FREEING UP MORE TESTOSTRON AGAIN FREENG UP TESTOSTRON MAY BE EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT I JUST DON'T THINK THAT WE NEED SHOULD DEMONIZE THESE CARRIER PROTINES LIKE ALBUMINAN ES B G IN FACT ALBUMAN IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR TESTASTRONE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT INTO THE BRAIN TO HAVE SOME OF THE PRO ANDROGENIC EFFECTS ON THE COGNIVE EFFECTS AT TESTOSTRONE BECAUSE IN BOTH MALES AND FEMALES TESTSTRONE CAN SHIFT THESE AM BEHAVIORS LIKE MATE SEEKING AM REDUCTIONS IN IN A ANXIETY AN SO FORTH TO WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE ONLY BY MAKING INTO THE BRAIN AND THERE IS THIS THING CALLED THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER A WHICH IS FASCINATING AND DESERVING AN ENTIRE EPISODE ALS O AND GETTING MOLECULES ACROSS THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER EVEN IF THEIR SEXSTORID HORMONES WHICH ARE LEPOFHILIC IN CAPASS THROUGH SELMEMBRINES REQUIRES CARRIERS AND THOSE CARRIERS OFTEN ARE BOUN TO OR INCLUDE ALBUMAN AND SO IT'S NOT THE GOAL IT YOU KNOW TO FREE UP ALL YOUR TESTOSTRON BUT GETTING FREE TESTOSTRONE INTO ARRANGE THAT WORKS FOR YOUR PARTICULAR GOALS IN NEEDS IS AAN ATTRACTIVE ONE AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE DISCUSSING THESE PARTICULAR TOOLS O THE MOUNTS OF BORON THAT PEOPLE TAKEAND AND YOU CAN FIND THIS AGAIN ON PUBMET OR EXAMINE BUT PEOPLE TAKE A COUPLEO GRAMS OF IT A DAY I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY SPES OF EXCITIFECTS B ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS WANT T EXAMINE FOR THE PARTICULAR SIDEAFFECTS AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS AND CONDITIONS AS WE TALKED ABOUT FOR MENOPOS AN ESTROGEN HAVE TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE STARTING TO MODULATE HORMONES YOU'RE STARTING TO MODULATE NOT JUST THE TISSUES THAT THRIVE ON BINDING OF THOSE HORMONES BUT REMEMBER AM THE REASON WHY THEIRE SO MUCH BREAST CANTSARE IN TERE'S REASON WHY THER SO MUCH TESTICULAR CANCER IS THAT ANY TISSUE THAT UNDERGOES RAPID REPRODUCTION OF PARTICULAR CELLS SO THERE'S A LOT OF REPRODUCTION OF CELLS AND SHEDDING OF UTER IN LINING IN THE RE PRODUCTION O CELLS AND EGGS IN THE OVERY AND IN THE TESTES THERE'S THE PRODUCTION OF LIDIG AND  SARE TOLLY CELLS AND THERE'S THISCONO ONGOING PRODUCTION OF SPERM THAT'S WHY THOSE TISSUES ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF CANCERS AND MANY OF THOSE CANCERS ARE ANDROGEN SENSITIVE THAT'S WHY ONE OF THE MAJOR TREATMENTS FOR PROSTATE OVERGROWTH OR PROSTATE CANCER IS TO GIVE ANTI ANDROGENIC DRUGS  CA IT'S NOT JUST A SHUT DOWN ALL THINGS A YOU KNOW RELATED TO BEING A ANDROGENIZED IT'S REALLY ABOUT TRYING TO PREVENT TESTOSTRONE FROM ENCURGING GROWTH OF TUMERS SO I WANT IT YOU KNOW REALLY EMPHASIZE THE CAUTION THERE A BECAUSE IT IS EASY WHEN THINKING ABOUT OPTIMIZING ESTROGEN AND TESTOSTRONE TO JUST THINK O MORE IS BETTER MORE IS DEFILY NOT BETTER AND ITS NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY CAN AROMATIZE ARE CONVERT INTO OTHER THINGS IT'S BECAUSE CANCERS OR ANY TISSUE THAT HAS A LOT OF TURN OVER OF CELLS IS GOING TO THRIVE ON ANDROGEN ANYTHING THAT PROMOTES GROWTH IS GOING TO THRIVE ON ESTROGEN REMEMBER BRAIN TISSUE DOESN'T TURN OVER THAT MUCH THERE ISN'T REALLY MUCH PRODUCTION OF NEW NURONS BRAIN CANCERS HAPPEN BUT THEIR KIND OF RARE AND WHEN THEY DO HAPPEN THEY TEN TO BE GLEAL CELLS WHICH HAVE A LOT OF PROLIFERATION GLEAL CELLS CAN PROLIFERATE ADULTNERONS DON'T CREATE MORE THEMSELVES THEY DON'T CREATE MORE NURONS IN GENERAL EXCEPT IN A FEW PLACES IN THE BRAIN AND BODY SO ANY TISSUE THAT RECYCLES ITSELF IS PRONE TO CANCERS AND THOSE TISSUES THRIVE ON ANDROGENS AND ESTROGENS TO CREATE MORE TUMER SO YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHEN ANY TIME YOUR MODULATING HORMONES ESPECIALLY ANDROGENS AND ESTROGENS AND IN MY SCOURING OF THE LITERATURE AND LOOKING AT AND WHAT'S OUT THERE AND WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT AND I ALSO MEAN IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT AM IS NEW TO ME ANYWAY PROBABLY NOT NEW TO A A LOT OF THE JIM RATS OUT THERE BUT A OR THE PEOPLE THAT SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON YOU TWO VIDIOS TALKING ABOUT A ANDROGENS ARE THESE A FORGIVE ME FOR BUTCHERING THE NAME AGAIN ARE THESE ECTISTEROIDS SO ECTI STEROIDS AR AM MOLECULES THAT COME FROM THINGS LIKE SPINACH BELIEVE IT OR NOT THAT HAVE A LOT OF SIMILARITY TO THE COLLESTRAL MOLECULE THE ONE THAT'S BEING DISCUSSED A LOT OUT THERE RIGHT NOW IS SOMETHING CALLED TURCI STERONE AM I WISH I KNEW WHY WAS CALLED TURKISTERONE SOME ONE TELL ME WHY IT'S CALLED TURKISTERON DES I MANING DO IT TURKEYS AM I KNO WHY IT'S CALLED TURKISTERONE A PERHAPS SOME ONEWIL WIL NO IN ANY CASE M THESE ECTOSTEROIDS ARE SIMILOR ENOUGH TO COLLASTRAL REMEMBER COLESTERALL IS THE PRECURSER TO TESTASTRONE QUARTISAL AND ESTROGEN AND IT APPEARS THAT SOME OF THESE ECTOSTEROIDS DO HAVE BIO AVAILABILITY OR THEIR METABOLITES ARE BY AVAILABLE AND THIS WAS  SOMETHING THAT FOR MANY YEARS PEOPLE TALK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT INSECT HORMONS OR HORMONES FROM OTHER SPECIES COULD ACTUALLY BE USED BY HUMANS OR WHETHER NOT IT WOULD HAVE ANY EFFECT AT ALL AND IT'S PRETTY CLEAR BASED ON A STUDY THAT I WAS ABLE FIND THERE'S A A PAPER THAT CAME OUT IN TWENTY NINETEEN A THE S A COMPARATIVE STUDY A IN THE ARCIVES OF TOCICOLOGY THIS IS ISINMEN AT ALL I S E N M  N N AT ALL THAT TALKS ABOUT THE ECTOSTEROIDS AM AND WAS GIVEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH STRENGTHTERY STRENGTHTRAINING OR NO STRENGTHTRAINING THIS IS A TEN WEK INTERVENTION AND THEIR CONCLUSION IS THAT AM THESE ECTOSTEROIDS HAD A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT ABOVE PLESIBO CONTROLS INCREASES IN MUSCLEMA STRENGTH HY PERCHER VE EFFECTS ALL THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT ONE WOULD EXPECT WITH AM INCREASES IN ANDROGEN A THEIR CONCLUSION OF THI STUDY AM IS NOT MY CONCLUSION A ALTHOUGH I MAY OR MAY NOT AGREE WITH THEM O THIS IS 'N ABOUT MY OPINIONS IT'S JUST I ONE O BE CLEAR THESE ARE THEIR WORDS NOT MINE BUT THEY THEIRS THEY SAY THAT AM IN THEIR WORDS QUOTE OUR RESULT STRONGLY SUGGEST THE INCLUSION OF ECTOSTERON IN THE LIST OF PRO HIBITIVE SUBSTANCES TO THEIR SAYING THESE THINGS ARE SO POWERFUL THAT THEY SHOULD BE ON THE LIST OF BAND SUBSTANCES WHICH AM MIGHT BE A UPSETTING TO SOME OR AM SOME OF YOU MIGHT BE THINKING  WHO CARS  THE WHOLE ISSUE OF AUGMENTING A HORMONES IN SPORT IS OF VERY INTERESTING ISSUE IN FACT IF YOU JUST WANT A LITTLE ANECDOTE ABOUT THAT I CAN'T REVEAL NAMES HERE OF COURSE BUT WHAT I LEARNED RECENTLY WAS VERY SURPRISING TO ME WHICH IS THAT MANY ATHLETES IN PROSPORTS AR TAKING TESTASTRON AND THEY ARE ABLE TO DO THAT LEGALLY AM NOT JUST BECAUSE IT'S AVAILABLE BY PRESCRIPTION BUT THEY ARE ALLOWED TO DO THAT UNDER THE RULES OF THEIR SPORT IN THE FINE PRINT THAT NO ONE INCLUDING ME HAD EVER SEEN IF THEY'VE HAD AN INJURY SO IF ATHLETES ARE INJURED THEN IT OPENS UP THE DOOR FOR CERTAIN AM FORMS OF TESTASTRON AUGMENTATION AM ANOTHER A TYPES OF A AUGMENTATIONS THAT ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO THEM IF THEY'RE NOT INJURED WHICH ALWAYS MAKES ME WONDER NOW WHEN I SEE THEM GETTING INJURED WHETHER OR NOT A THAT'S AN ATTEMPT TO GET SOME OF THE SUPPORT BECAUE THEREIS ABSOLUTELY NO QUESTION THAT ESTROGES IN TESTOSTRONE'S MODULATE GENE EXPRESSION MODULATE STRENGTH MODULATE THE WAY THE BRAIN WORKS MODULATES OUR RELATIONSHIP TO EFFORT AND ANXIETY ET CETERA AND WHILE WERE TIKGE ABOUT SUPPLEMENTATION THE EFFECTS OF SUPPLEMENTATION I WOULD SAY IN SOME INDI VIDUALS CAN BE QUITE DRAMATIC BUT THERE ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS EXCEPT IN EXTREME CASES GOING TO BE FAR SUBTLER AM SCUSE ME FAR MORE SUBTLE AM TO USE THE THE PROPER A ENGLISH FARMORE SUBTLE THEN WOULD BE FOR INSTANCE JUST IN INJECTING TESTOSTRONE OR INJECTING ESTROGEN ET CETERA SO I THINK WE SHOULD JUST BE HONEST AN OUT FRONT ABOUT THAT SO THUS FAR IN TERMS OF TALKING ABOUT OPTIMIZING HORMONES AND IN THE DISCUSSION OF SUPPLEMENTATION I HAVEN'T RALLY TALKED ABOUT THINGS THAT ACTUALLY EFFECT THE BRAIN DIRECTLY THAT INCREASE THE PETUITARY OUTPUT AND THINGS THAT SORT MAINLY BEEN TALKING ABOUT THINGS THAT FREE UP TESTOSTRONE ER THAT INCREASE ESTROGEN AT THE LEVEL OF THE PERIPHERY BUT IF YOU REMEMBER WAY BACK TO THE BEGIN THIS EPISODE HORMONES ARE MADE IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IN THE BODY AND THEN THERE ARE HORMONES THAT PROMOTE THE RELEASE IN THE PRODUCTION OF OF HORMONES FROM OTHER TISSUES IN THE BODY AND ONE OF THE MAIN HORMONES FOR THAT IS LUTINIZING HORMONE LUTINIZING HORMONE AGAIN COMES FROM THE PETUITARY CIRCULATES AND EITHER GOES TO THE OVERY TO PPROMOTE VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OF EGMATERATION AM AS WELL AS PRODUCTION OF ESTROGEN AND TO THE TESTES TO PROMOTE TESTOSTRONE AND SPERM PRODUCTION AND THE PRESCRIPTION VERSION OF INCREASING LUTINIZING HORMONE IS SOMETHING ALLED H C G OR HUMAN COREONIC GANATITROPEN WHICH HAS BEEN SYNTHESIZED AND IS NOW AVAILABLE AS A PRESCRIPTION DRUG IT'S TAKEN INVARIOUS A CONTEXT FOR INCREASING FERTILITY BOTH BY MALES AND BY FEMALES IT CAN INCREASE AM FOR ALL THE REASONS THAT NOW MAKE SENSE IT CAN INCREASE SPERM PRODUCTION IT CAN PRODUCE A OPULATION FREQUENCY IT CAN PRODUCE THE NUMBER OF EGGS EVEN THAT THAT ARE DEPLOYED AND IN A GIVEN OVULATION ALTHOUGH THAT'S NOT ALWAYS A GOOD THING AM ITBASICALLY IS PRO FERTILITY PROTESTOSTRONE PRO ESTROGEN DEPENDING ON YEUR BACKGROUND AND WHAT'S INTERESTING IS H C G WAS INITIALLY A SYNTHESIZED AM COLLECTIN SYNTHESIZED FROM PREGNANT WOMEN'S URINE AN BELIEVE IT OR NOT A BEFORE IT WAS SYNTHETICALLY A MADE AND SOLDED S HE PRESCRIPTION DRUG AM THERE WAS ACTALLY A BLACK MARKET A FOR PREGNANT WOMEN'S URINE WHERE PEOPLE WOULD BUY THE URINE I DON'T KNOW I'M GESSING THAT THEY PROBABLY JUST AUM CONSUMED IT WHICH IS WEIRD BUT IN ANY CASE AM HUMAN CORYONIC ANNATROPEN IS NOW AVAILABLE AS A PRESCRIPTION DRUG AND ITS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MANY PEOPLE USE TO INCREASE TESTOSTRONE OR ESTROGEN FO OR INCREASING FERTILITY SOME CASES I THINK IT'S USE TO INCREASE SPORTS PERFORMANCE OR WHEN PEOPLE HAVE SHUT DOWN THERE THEIR GONADS AM FOR WHATEVER REASON BECAUSE OF EXCESSIVE HORMON THERAPES OR THEY HAVE AM A SOME SORT OF SOMETIMES THEIR ACTUALLY LESIONS THAT TO THE PETUITARY SOMETIMES WE WILL HAVE A TUMOR IN THE PETUITARY SASH NOT COMMON BUT AMONG BRAIN TUMORS AND NORAL TUMORS IT'S ONE OF THE MORE COMMON ONES AND THEN YOU GET DEFICIENCIES IN ELAGIAN EFFESAGIONS OF PEOPLE TAKE  SEG TO STIMULATE THE GONADS SO THE VARIETY REASON WHY THESE DRUGS WERE WERE CREATED BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN SUPPLEMENTS NOT MANY THAT APPARENTLY CAN INCREASE LUINIZING HORMON AND THEREBY E AN INCREASE TOSTASTRON AND ESTROGEN AND ONE OF THE MORE ON WELL DOCUMENTED ONES IS FIDOGIA AGRASTIS THAT'S F A D O G I A SEPARATE WORD A G R E S T I S WHICH LEAST ACCORDING TO THE LITERATURE A THAT I WAS ABLE TO FIND CAN INCREASE LEVELS OF LUINIZING HORMONE AND THEREBY LEVELS OF TISTASTRONE OR LEVELS OF ESTROGEN AND AGAIN IF AN INDIVIDUAL WERE TO TAKE FIDOGIAGRASTIS WHAT THEY WOULD PROBABLY FIND IS THAT TESTASTRON ESTROGEN WOULD INCREASE IN ANY ONE OF ANY CROMOZELMO GONATAL BACKGROUND BUT REMEMBER IT'S THE RATIO OF BOTH SO BOTH IF SOME ONE HAS LOESTROGEN HYG TESTASTRONE LET SAY THEY HAVE TESTIES JUST BY WAY OF EXAMPLE THAN BOTH OF THOSE SHOULD IT WOULD BE EXPECTED TO INCREASE AND IF SOME ONE HAS HIGHESTROGEN AND LOTESTASTRONE ENLES TOU SAY HAS OVERIS THEN BOTH OF THOSE W WOULD INCREASE BY TAKING FIDOGIA AGRESTUS A THE CIDE EFFECT PROFILE OF FIDOGIAGRESIS HASN'T REALLY BEEN DOCUMENTED SO IT'S A LITTLE UNCLEAR I JUSTR ONE EMPHASIZE THAT ANY TIME SOME ONE'S GOING TO START TAKING SUPPLEMENTS THAT A OR MODIFYING SEXTROIED HORMONES GETTING BLOOD WORK DONE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AM IT FOR SAFETY REASONS AND ALSO JUST TO KNOW WHETHER NOT THINGS ARE WORKING AND BECAUSE ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE SUBJECT TO NEGATIVE FEED BACK TALKD ABOUT THIS PREVIOUSLY A PREVIOUS EPISODE BUT IF TESACTRON GOES HIGH OR TOO HIGH IT CAN FEED BACK AND SHUT DOWN LUTINIZING HORMONE WHICH WILL THEN SHUT DOWN FOR THER TESTACTEROM PRODUCTION LIKEWISE IF ESTROGENS ARE GOING TOO HIGH HERE THEYRE GOING TOO HIGH AT VARIOUS PHASES THE CYCL THAT CAN START TO THROW OFF VARIOUS OTHER HORMONES INCLUDING AM EFAS GE PROGESTRONE EL H THE MENSTRAL CYCLE ITSELF IS A JUST ABSOLUTELY EXQUISITE BALANCE OF FEED BACK OF LUTE LUTINIZING HORMONE KEPT LOW AND CONSTAN ELEASE FOR THE FIRST FOURTEEN DAYS THE CYCLE THAN MIDCYCLE THERE'S A PEAK AND THAT'S TYPICALLY WHEN OPULATION OCCURS THAT'S WHY PREGNANCY IS MOST LIKLY DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE TWENTY IGHT A CYCLE EFAS GE KIND OF GOES UP AND THEN DOWN ACROSS THE FIRST FOURTEEN DAYS SO TAKING ANYTHING OR REALLY MODIFYING ONES ESTROGENS OR TESTASTRONN ON THAT BACKGROUND OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE IS REALLY GOING TO DISTRUPT THE WAY THOSE THINGS INTERACT AND IT'S JUST SUCH AN EXQUISITE FEED BACLUPE SO I'M NOT SING DON'T AM DO THAT BUT YOU DEFILY WANT TO BE AWARE OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND BLOOD DRAWS ARE ONE WAY TO DO THAT MONITERING SYCLS A FOR OBULATING FEMALES IS ANOTHER WAY TO DO THAT AND IN MALES HAVING A GOOD WINDOW INTO WHAT'S GOING ON WITH TESTOSTRON D H T EROMATAS ESTRODYL AM IS ELL AH ET CETERA IS JUST VITAL AND IT'S REALLY A PARTIN PARCEL WITH THE PRACTISE OF THINKING ABOUT OPTIMIZING THESE INCREDIBLE THINGS THAT WE CALL SEXTROYD HORMONES ESTROGEN AND TESTOSTRON AND THEIR DERIVATIVES THE LIST OF SUPPLEMENTS AND MOLECULES THAT CAN ADJUST ESTROGEN AND TESTOSTRONE IS VAST AND I ONLY TOUCHTRON A FEW OF THESE I I REALLY TRY TO EMPHASIZE THE ONES FOR WHICH THERE ARE HUMAN STUDIES A OR THAT HAVE MOSTLY HUMAN STUDIES OR MAYBE EVEN JUST ONE HUMAN STUDY THERE ARE OTHER THINGS OUT THERE A FOR WHICH THERE ARE SCIENTIFIC DATA THINGS LIKE BULBINE NATOLENSIS WHICH DEFINITELY HAS SUPPORT FOR INCREASING TESTOSTRONE BUT ALL THE STUDIES WERE IN RATS AM I THINK THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE IN HUMANS BUT THE EVIDENCES MAINLY COMES IN THE FORM OF A WILL WE CALL SPONSERD RESEARCH O COMPANIES PAYING FOR RESEARCH WHICH IS DIFFERENT THAN INDEPENDENT RESEARCH BY PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT A BIASTINTERMS OF THE OUTCOME AND THE REASON I DIN THROUGHOUT THINGS LIKE BULLBY NATOLENSIS S THEY SEEM TO HAVE A LIVERTOXICITY SIMILAR TO A HIGH LEVELS OF ANABOLIC A EXOGENIS STEROIDS THERE SOME PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM THAT MAKE THEM AM YOU KNOW IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT IF YOUR CURIOUS ABOUT THIS ARION AND THE ENDERCHONOLOGY BUT ALSO AM SOMEWHAT PRECARIOUS AND YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE CATEGORY SO STUFF THAT DOESN'T AVE A LOT OF EVIDENCE IN HUMANS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE DANGEROUS AM THE OTHER CATEGORY OF THINGS THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE OR LEVELS OF OR INCREASE I SHOULD SAY AT ON SAY IMPROVE CAUSE IT'S UP TO YOU WHETHER NOT UEN INCREASEER DECREASE ESTROGEN TESTOSTRON AT'S HIGHLY INDIVIDUAL HOW COULD I KNOW ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE KIND OF HOUSEKEEPING FOR PRODUCTION OF ESTROGEN AND TESTOSTRON THINGS LIKE MAGNESIUM THINGS LIKE DETHREE THINGS LIKE A ZINC YET THOSE OF THE THINGS THAT A ARE GOING TO CREATE AND OVERALL MILEU OF OPPORTUNITY TO PRODUCE NORMAL ANDOGENIS LEVELS RATHER THAN INCREASING INDOGENIS LEVELS FURTHER AND SO I REALLY WANT AT HIGH LIGHT THAT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TAKING SOMETHING TO CREATE A KIND OF BACK DROP OF GENERAL SUPPORT AND TAKING SOMETHING THAT'S CAN A CREATE A BIG INFLECTION IN THE LEVELS OF A GIVEN HORMON SO ONCE AGAIN WE COVERED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INFORMATION WE COVERED SOME BASIC SCIENCE OF HORMONES AND PERMONES ESTROGEN AND TESTOSTRONE AND THEIR DERIVATIVES WE TALKED ABOUT SUPPLEMENTATION AND BEHAVIORS COMPETITION AND PARENTING AND HOW ALL THESE THINGS INTERACT AND I HOPE THAT YOU'LL COME AWAY FROM THIS WITH A DEEPER MECHANISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE BRAIN AND BODY ARE INTERACTING TO CONTROL THE OUTPUT AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THESE INCREDIBLE THINGS THAT WE CALL SEXTROAD HORMON'S WORK AND INFLUENCE US HOPE YOU'LL ALSO COME AWAY WITH SOME IDEAS OF THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO IN PARTICULAR BEHAVIORAL PRACTICES THT CAN IMPROVE SLEEP AND YOUR RELATIONSHIP TO LIGHT ET CETERA BECAUSE THOSE THINGS REALLY SET THE FOUNDATION NOT JUST FOR HEALTHY STERITE HORMONE OUTPUT BUT FOR ALL SORTS OF HEALTH EFFECTS AND FOR BOTH THE PSYCHOLOGY AND THE BIOLOGY OF YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM SO I AM SURE THERE'LL BE MANY QUESTIONS TERE MANY THINGS THAT I COULDN'T GET TO TODAY OH I DO TRY AND LIMIT THESE EPISODES TO ABOUT NINETY MINUTES WHICH IS THE OPTIMON O ALTRADIAN CYCLE FOR LEARNING AH IT'S A LOT OF INFORMATION BUT WE'VE TIMESTAMPED EVERYTHING FOR YOU SO FEEL FREE TO O LOOK OVER IT IN PARTS OR CIRCLE BACK WHERE YOU MIGHT WANT DEEPER UNDERSTANDING AND PLEASE PUT YOUR QUESTIONS IN THE COMMENT SECTION BELOW PLEASE PUT SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE EPISODES AND THINGS THAT RELATE TO HORMONES IN THE COMMENT SECTION BELOW WE DO LOOK AT THOSE AND WE DO USE THEM TO INFORM THE CONTENT FOR SUBSEQUENT EPISODES IF YOU'RE ENJOYING AND LEARNING FROM THIS PODCAST PLEASE SUBSCRIBE ON YOU TO OR IF YOU PREFER PLEASE SUBSCRIBE ON APPLE AND OR SPODIFY AT APPLE YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY ALSODE TO LEAVE US UP TO A FIVE STAR REVIEW AND TO LEAVE A COMMENT IN THE REVIEW SECTION PLEASE ALSO INFORM YOUR FRIENDS FAMILY CO WORKERS ANY ONE THAT YOU THINK MIGHT ALSO BENEFIT FOM THE INFORMATION THAT WERE COVERING THAT REALLY HELPS US GROW OUR AUDIENCE AND BRING MORE INFORMATION TO YOU AS WELL PLEASE CHECK OUT OUR SPONSORS MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH EPISODE AND AS MENTIONED THE BEGINNING OF TO DAY'S EPISODE WE ARE NOW PARTNERED WITH MOMENTOUS SUPPLEMENTS BECAUSE THEY MAKE SINGLE INGREDIENT FORMULATIONS THAT ARE THE ABSOLUTE HIGHEST QUALITY END ASHIP INTERNATIONAL IF YOU GO TO LIVE MOMENTOUS TOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN YOU WILL FIND MANY OF THE SUPPLEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED ON VARIOUS EPISODES OF THE HUBRMAN LAD PODCAST AND YOU WILL FIND VARIOUS PROTOCALS RELATED TO THOSE SUPPLEMENTS ENCLOSING I HOPE YOU'LL LEAVE TO DAY'S EPISODE WITH A MUCH RICHER UNDERSTANDING OF THE MECHANISMS THAT CONTROL THE ENDIGRAN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM IN THE CONTECT OF ESTROGEN AND TOSTOSTERONE AS WELL AS TAKE AWAY VARIOUS TOOLS THAT YOU MIGHT CHOOSE TO APPLY AND NEXT WEEK WILL BE BACK WITH ANOTHER EPISODE ABOUT THE ROLL OF HORMONES AND ITS IMPORTANT INTERACTIONS WITH THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THAT WILL OF COURSE INCLUDE BOTH MECHANISMS AND TOOLS AS WELL AND AS ALWAYS THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN SCIENCE

WELCOME TO THE HUBERAN LADPODCAS  U SCIENCE SCIENCE BASE TO NI MANDEUR HUBERMAN AND ON ROPROFESSOR OF NERBIOLOGY AND OPTOMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS YOUR BRAIN CHEMISTRY AND HOW TO CONTROL AND OPTOMIZE YOUR BRAIN CHEMISTRY FOR ALL ASPECTS OF MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THE HUBERMAN LABPODCAST AND FRANKLY EVERY TIME I'M A GUEST ON ANOTHER PODCAST I GET QUESTIONS ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE BASE TOOLS FOR THINGS LIKE ENHANCING SLEEP ENHANCING FOCUS ENHANCING CREATIVITY IMPROVING RELATIONSHIPS GETTING OVER GRIEF AND ON AND ON ALL OF WHICH ARE VALIDQUESTIONS AND FOR WHICH THERE ARE PROTOCOLS THAT ARE BASED IN SCIENCE AND THAT WORK THE FIRST TIME AND EVERY TIME HOWEVER FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN KNOWING A PROTOCOL IS UNDERSTANDING WYA GIVEN PROTOCOL WORKS THAT'S WHY I'M ALWAYS HAMMERING ON MECHANISM AND EXPLAINING THE CELLS AND CIRCUITS AND CHEMICALS AT LEAST TO SOME DETAIL SO THAT PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND NOT JUST WHAT TO DO BUT WHY IT WORKS AND THEREFORE HOW TO CHANGE YOUR PROTOCOL AS THEIR LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE OR AS GOALS CHANGE NOW TO DAY WE ARE GOING TO GO EVEN A LAYER DEEPERK WE ARE GOING TO EXPLORE THE FOUNDATIONS OF YOUR BIOLOGY IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY THAT ALLOW ANY PROTOCOL TO WORK BECAUSE AS IT TURNS OUT ALL OF THE PROTOCOLS OUT THERE WHETHER NOTS A BREATHING PROTOCOL OR A SUPPLEMENT OR A PRESCRIPTION DRUG OR AN EXERCISE ROUTINE THEY ALL TAP IN TO AND LEVERAGE A COURSE SET OF JUST A FEW BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS THAT'S RIGHT BENEATH EVERYTHING YOU ARE ABLE TO DO AND FEEL AND INDEED BENEATH EVERY PROTOCOL THAT ALLOWS YOU TO CHANGE FOR THE BETTER AND OPTIMIZE YOUR MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE THERE IS JUST A SMALL SUBSET OF CHEMICALS THAT YOUR LEVERAGING TOWARD THAT CHANGE SO TO DAY WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE FOUR MAJOUR PILLARS OF NEURO CHEMISTRY THAT ALLOW YOU TO FOR INSTANCE BE FOCUSED WHEN YOU WANT TO FOCUS THAT ALLOW YOU TO RELAX WHEN YOU NEED TO RELAX IN DESTREST THAT ALLOW YOU TO OPTIMIZE YOUR SLEEP THAT ALLOW YOU TO OPTIMIZE YOUR EXERCISE ROUTINE OR TO WORK THROUGH A PAIN POINT IN RELATIONSHIP OR IN CAREER OR IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP TO YOURSELF SO WHAT I CAN SAY FOR SHORE IS THAT BY THE END OF THIS EPISODE YOU WILL HAVE A MUCH RICHER UNDERSTANDING ABOUT HOW YOUR BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM AND INDEED YOUR ENTIRE BODY WORK AND YOU WILL HAVE A MUCH FIRMER UNDERSTANDING AS TO WHICH PROTOCOLS AN TOOLS TO REACH FOR GIVEN YOUR PARTICULARGOLS IN THE MOMENT IN THE DAY ACROSS THE WEAK ACROSS THE MONTH ACROSS THE YEAR AND INDEED A CROSS YOUR ENTIRE LIFE SPAN SO WHAT WERE REALLY GOING FOR TO DAY ARE PRINCIPLS DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF WHY ANY GIVEN PROTOCOL WORKS AND WE ARE ALSO GOING TO DISCUSS SPECIFIC PROTOCOLS SOME OF THOSE PROTOCOLS I'VE DISCUSSED ON PREVIOUS EPISODE TO THE HUBERMAN LABPODCAST BUT I MUST SAY MANY OF THE PROTOCOLS AN TOOLS THAT I WILL DISCUSS ARE BRAND NEW AND BASE D ON RESEARCH THAT I HAVE NOT DISCUSSED AT ALL SIMPLY BECAUSE THE RESEARCH PAPERS CAME OUT ONLY RECENTLY OR THESE ARE PAPERS THAT I ONLY RECENTLY UNEARTHED IN FACT I MEN A SHARE WITH YOU TWO RECENT STUDIES IN A MOMENT THAT ARE EXCEEDINGLY IMPORTANT FOR OPTIMIZING YOUR SLEEP AND THESE ARE STUDIES THAT AGAIN I NEVER DISCUSSED IN ANY EPISODE ON SLEEP OR ON ANY OTHER PODCAST SO BY THE END OF TO DAY'S EPISODE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE FAR MORE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT YOUR BIOLOGY AND PSYCHOLOGY THAN YOU DID AT THE START AND YOU'LL BE ARMED WITH MANY MORE TOOLS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY PRINC OPALES SO THAT YOU CAN NAVIGATE NOT JUST THE TOOLS PRESENTED ON THIS POD CAST BUT IN THE VAST LANDSCAPE OF TOOLS THAT ARE OUT THERE FOR MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE EVER SO OFTEN I COME ACROSS A STUDY OR SET OF STUDIES THAT I GET SO EXCITED ABOUT THAT I START TELLING EVERYBODY IN MY IMMEDIATE LIFE AND I INSIST ON ALSO SHARING IT WITH YOU THE LISTENERS OF THIS PODCAST BECAUSE I FIND THE INFORMATION TO BE SO INCREDIBLY INTERESTING AND ACTIONABLE THE TWO STUDIES THET OMINANT DISCUSS BOTH RELATE TO SLEEP AND SLEEP STATES AND HAD A ACCESS BETTER SLEEP THE FIRST ONE WAS PUBLISH IN THE JOURNAL SELL REPORT SELL PRESS JOURNAL EXCELLENT JOURNAL THE TITLE OF THIS PAPER IS RAPID AND REVERSIBLE CONTROL OF HUMAN METABOLISM BY INDIVIDUAL SLEEP STATES WE WILL PROVIDE LINK TO THE STUDY IN THE SHOW CAPTIONS THE FIRST AUTHOR IS NORA NO WACK AND  W A K AND BASICALLY WHAT THEY DID IS THEY MEASURED THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF METABOLISM THAT OCCUR WHILE HUMANS SLEEP AS FAR AS I KNOW THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST STUDIES OF THIS KIND THERE ARE MANY STUDIES OF METABOLISM THEIRE MANY STUDIES OF SLEEP THIS STUDY FOCUSED ON HOW DIFFERENT STATES OF SLEEP SUCH AS RAPID I MOVEMENT SLEEP WHICH IS ASSOCIATE WITH DREAMING AND HI EMOTIONAL CONTENT DREAMS VERSES SLOW WAVED SLEEP WHICH TENDS TO BE MORE FOCUSSED ON PHYSICAL REPAIR OF THE BODY MORE MONDANE DREAMS HOW THOSE DIFFERENT STATES OF MIND DURING SLEEP RELATE TO DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF METABOLISM AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING FIRST OF ALL THEY FOUND THAT SLEEP STATES REGULATE MORE THAN FIFTY PER CENT HALF OF ALL THE METABOLITE FEATURES DETECTED IN HUMAN BREATH WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT YOU CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT HUMANS ARE METABOLIZING IN PARTICULAR MORE LIPIDS OR MORE CARBOHYDRATE WHETHERE NOT THER RELYING MORE IN LUCOS METABOLISM TASED ON THE CONTENTS OF THEIR BREATH THIS IS TRUE DURING WAKING AND DURING SLEEP THIS IS WHAT ALLOWED THEM TO DO THESE INCREDIBLE MEASUREMENTS OF WHAT'S BEING METABOLIZED DURING SLEEP THEY MEASURED CLOSE TO TWO THOUSAND METABOLITES IN BREATH EVERY TEN SECONDS ACROSS THE ENTIRE NITE SLEEP ND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT THERE ARE MAJOR PATHWAYS RELATED TO LIPID METABOLISM FATMATABOLISM OR TWO CARBOHYDRATE METABOLISM OR OTHER FORMS OF METABOLISM THAT ARE UPWARD DOWN REGULATED AS HUMAN BEINGS TRANSITION BETWEEN SLOW WAVED SLEEP RAP AND I MOVEMENT SLEEP AND WAKING AND YOU MIGHT SAY WAKING WELL YES THEY ALSO LOOKED AS PEOPLE FELL ASLEEP AND AS THEY EMERGE FROM SLEEP AND BELIEVE IT ARE NOT EVER SO OFTEN DRING SLEEP YOU WAKE UP YOU DIDN'T KNOW THIS B WAKE UP IN MILLLINITE YOU LOOK AROUND AND YOU GO BACK TO SLEEP YOU'RE NOT AWARE OF IT BECAUSE YOU'RE STILL IN A R ATHER O SLEEP LIKE STATE ALTHOUGH YOU ARE AWAKTE WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT SLEEP AND THE VARIOUS STATES OF SLEEP REGULATED INDIVIDUAL METABOLIC PATHWAYS THEY FOUND FOR INSTANCE THAT THE SWITCH FROM SLEEP TO WAKEFULNESS REDUCES PHATIASIDOXIDATION SO THAT MEANS WHILE YOUR SLEEP YOUR OXIDATING MORE PHATIACIDS THAND AS YOU WAKE UP THAT BECOMES LESS THE CASE AND THERE'S A SWITCH IN SLOW WAVE SLEEP THAT INCREASES PHATIACIDOXIDATION AND THERE'S THE TRANSITION FROM RAPIDEE MOVEMENT SLEEP TO OTHER ASPECTS OF SLEEP THAT BRINGS ABOUT THINGS LIKE THE SO CALT C A CYCHAL SOME OF YOU FAMILIAR WITH MTABLISM WILL BE FAMILIAR WITH THE TECA CYCHAL THE SO CALLED TRYCARBOLIC ACID PCYCHAL INTERMEDIATES THAT'S FANCY NERVE SPEEP FOR SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF METABOLISM BEING REGULATED DURING THIS RAPID EYE MOVEMENT SLEEP TRANSITION WHAT IS ALL THIS MEAN AND HOW IS THIS ACTIONABLE WELL ON MANY EPISODES OF THE HUBERMENLAPODCAST SUCH AS THE MASTER SLEEP EPISODE AND THE EPISODE THAT WERE GOING INTO IN FURTHER DEPTH TODAY WE'RE GING TO TALK ABOUT SLEEP AND HATAOPTOMIZE SLEEP IT'S BEEN THOUGHT OF BUT NOT REALLY TAMPED DOWN THAT QUALITY AND DEPTH OF SLEEP AND DURATION OF SLEEP IS IMPORTANT FOR METABOLISM DURING THE DAYTIME AND INDEED THAT'S THE CASE IF PEOPLE ARE SLEEP DEPRIVED OR THERE NOT SLEEPING ENOUGH THINGS LIKE GLUCOS METABOLISM ET CETERA GET REALLY DESRUPTIVE DURING THE DAYTIME BUT WHAT THIS CURRENT STUDY SHOWS IS THAT THE METABOLISM THAT YOU EXPERIENCED DURING SLEEP OR TO BE MORE SPECIFIC THAT RANGE OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF METABOLISM THE EXPERIENCE DURING SLEEP MAY SERVE TO TUNE UP OR TO INSURE THAT THE SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF METABLISM THAT YOU REQUIRE DURING WAKEFULNESS ARE WORKING PROPERLY IN ADDITION TO THAT THIS STUDY CLEARLY SHOWS THE GETTING ENOUGH SLEEP ALLOWS YOU TO TRANSICION THROUGH ALL THE VARIOUS FORMS OF METABOLISM AND USE ALL THOSE DIFFERENT FORMS OF METABOLIGHTS DURING SLEEP IN A WAY THAT'S IMMENSELY BENEFICIAL FOR THE SYSTEMS OF YOUR BRAIN AND BODY SO THE TACO MESSAGE HERE IS THAT AS THE AUTHORS STATE SLEEP AND EXSPERIENCING THE DIFFERENT STATES OF SLEEP SLOW WAVE SLEEP EARLY IN THE NIGHT PREDOMINANTLY PLUS RAPID EYE MOVEMENT SLEEP TOWARD THE END OF THE NIGHT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR OPTIMIZING METABOLIC CIRCUITS FOR HUMAN PERFORMANCE AND HEALTH IN OTHER WORDS BY NOT GETTING SUFFICIENT DURATION SLEEP YOURE NOT ALLOWING YOUR BODY AND BRAIN TO TRANSICIEN THROUGH ALL THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF FUEL UTILIZATION AND YOU'RE NOT TEACHING YOUR BRAIN AND BODY HOW TO USE SIMILAR TYPES OF FUELS DURING WAKEFULNESS SO AGAIN ALL THIS POINTS TO THE FACT THAT WE NEED TO BE GETTING SUFFICIENT QUALITY AND DURATION OF SLEEP SO IF YOU'RE SLEEP DEPRIVED EVEN BY AN HOUR OR SO YOU'RE GOING TO GET FAR LESS RAPIDEYE MOVEMENT SLEEP BECAUSE RAPID EYE MOVEMENT SLEEP IS WHAT OCCURS TOWARD THE END OF A SLEEP NIGHT DURING THE EARLY PARO THE NIGHT FAR MORE SLOW WAVE SLEEP IN GETTING LESS RAPID IE MOVEMENT SLEEP WE KNOW IT MAKES YOU MORE EMOTIONALLY LABILE BUT NOW WE KNOW IT'S ALSO GOING TO ALTER CERTAIN FORMS OF GLUCOS METABOLISM DURING THE NIGHT AND DURING WAKEFULNESS SO THAT ALL UNDER SCORES THE NEED TO GET SLEEP THEN THE QUESTION IS HOW TO GET ENOUGH SLEEP AND HOW TO MAKE SURE YOU GET INTO ALL THESE DIFFERENT SLEEP STATES THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR YOU SO CALLED NIGHT OWLS THERE'S A LOT OF CONTROVERSY OUT THERE AS TO WHETHER NOT DIFFERENT SO CALLED CHRONOTYPES EXIST THAT IS PEOPLE WHO JUST NATURALLY OR GUNETICALLY WANT TO BE AN EARLY BIRD WAKE UP EARLY AND GO TO BED EARLY SO THES PEOPLE THAT WAKE UP AT FOR A M AND WOULD BE MOST COMFORTABLE GOING TO BED BY SEVEN OR EIGHT P M OR NINE P M THEN THEEARE SO CALLED NIGHT OWLS PEOPLE THAT WOULD FEEL BEST OR TEN TO FEEL BEST WHEN THEY GO TO SLEEP AT ONE A M TWO A M EVEN THREE A M AND LIKE TO WAKE UP LATER EIGHT NINE TEN OR EVEN ELEVEN A M OR NOON AN THEN OF COURSE MOST PEOPLE GO TO SLEEP SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TEN P M AND MIDNIGHT AND WAKE UP SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FIVE A M AND SEVEN A M OR I SUPPOSE MORE TYPICALLY SIX A M AND EIGHT A M NOW WHETHER R NOT REAL CHRONOTYPES EXIST OR WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE SIMPLY SELECT SCHEDULES FOR SLEEP IN WAKEFULNESS THAT THEY LIKE BECAUSE OF THEIR SOCIAL SCHEDULES OR THE ACTIVITIES THEY ENJOY FOR INSTANCE SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO REALLY GO OUT THEY LIKE TO GOUT DANCING OR HEAR MUSIC OR SPEND TIME IN VENUES THAT ARE ONLY OPEN LATE AT NIGHT  DON'T EVEN OPEN UNTIL NOON OR AFTER OTHER PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF RARELY GO OUT AT NIGHT BUT I LIKE TO GET UP EARLY ALIKE EXERCISE I LIKE TO SEE THE SUNRISE ET CETERA SO I DON'T KNOW IF I'M A MORNING PERSON OR AN EVENING PERSON I JUST KNOW THE THINGS I ENJOY TEND TO HAPPEN IN THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY AND THE THINGS THAT I DON'T ENJOY QUITE AS MUCH TAN HAPPEN LATE AT NIGHT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER R NOT THEIR REAL GUNETIC PROPENSITIES TO BE A NIGHT OWL OR AN EARLY BIRD OR A SORT OF TYPICAL PERSON RIGHT THERE IN THE MIDDLE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE HAVE SOME CONTROL OVER THEIR SLEEP SCHEDULE AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO GET SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF REM SLEEP AND SLOW WAVE SLEEP FOR MANY REASONS BUT INCLUDING THE REASONS I DISCUSSED IN THE PREVIOUS STUDY RELATED TO METABOLISM I'M VERY EXCITED THEREFORE ABOUT A STUDY THAT CAME OUT IN SLEEP MEDICINE THIS WAS A FEW YEARS AGO BUT SOMEHOW I MISS THIS ONE AN WAS PUBLISHIN TWENTY NINETEEN AND THE TITLE F THIS ARTICLE IS A RESETTING THE LATE TIMING OF NIGHT OWLS HAS A POSITIVE IMPACT ON MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE THIS IS A STUDY DONE IN HUMANS FOCUSING SPECIFICALLY ON PEOPLE THAT LIKE TO STAY UP LATE AND SLEEP IN BUT WHO DESIRE TO BE ABLE TO GET UP AND FEEL ALERT IN ORDER TO GO TO WORK OR STUDY AND THEY WANT TO GO TO SLEEP A BIT EARLIER AND SO THERE A LOT OF QUESTIONS IMBEDDED IN THE STUDY IN PARTICULAR WHETHE R NOT PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY SHIFT THEIR SCHEDULE BY A FEW HOURS OR MORE SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE CONTEND THAT IF YOUR NIGHT OWL THAT'S JUST GOING TO BE IMPOSSIBLE OR VERY VERY CHALLENGING TO DO TURNS OUT IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE AND ITS NOT EVEN THAT CHALLENGING TO DO PROVIDED YOU DO THE RIGHT THINGS JUST A BRIEF OVER VIEW OF THE STUDY AND THEN I'LL GIVE YOU THE KEY TIKAAS IT WAS A RANDOMIZE CONTROL TRIAL IT INVOLVED A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE BOTH MALE AND FEMALE AND WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY USE NON PHORMOCALOGICAL PRACTICAL INTERVENTIONS IN A REAL WORLD SETTING HERE ON PARAPHRASING THEY USE TARGETED LIGHT EXPOSURE THEY USED CONSISTENT SLEEP WAKE TIMES THEY USED FIXED MEAL TIMES CAFINAN TAKE END EXERCISE THIS IS WHEN THE REASON I LOVE THE STUDY SO MUCH BECAUSE I'VE DONE EPISODES R IAVE TALKED ABOUT TEMPERATURE EXERCISE FEEDING AND MOST IMPORTANTLY LIGHT EXPOSURE AS A WAY TO CONTROL AND SHIFT YOUR SLEEP WAKECYCLES YOU'RE SO CALLED CIRCADIAN TIMING AND IN TRAINMENT WHAT DID THEY FIND WELL THEY FOUND QUOTE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN TERMS OF MOOD SO FAR LESS DEPRESSION AND STRESS SUBJECTIVELY MEASURED AS WELL AS IMPROVE COGNATIVE PERFORMANCE THAT WAS OBJECTIVELY MEASURES SO IM PROVE REACTION TIMES IMPROVE PHYSICAL GRIP STRENGTH WHICH IS ACTUALLY A MEASURE NOCHUST OF STRENGTH PERSE BUT ALSOOF NERVOUS SYSTEM FUNCTION AND A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT PEOPLE COULD DO IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE THEIR MORNING HOURS EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE NIGHT HOWLS PREVIOUSLY WHAT DID THEY HAVE PEOPLE DO WHILE I'M GOING TO SKAN ELISTTHESS OFF IN SORT OF A RAPID FIRE SUCCESSION THAT WILL PROVEYE TO LINK TO THE STUDY IF YOU WANT O LEARN MORE FIRST OF ALL THEY TOLD PARTICIPANTS TO TRY AND WAKE UP TWO TO THREE HOURS BEFORE THEIR TYPICAL WAKE UP TIME TWO TO THREE HOURS THAT SEEMS BRUTAL TO ME AND PROBABLY SEEMS BRUTAL TO YOU IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO TYPICALLY WAKES UP AT TN A M TO TRY AND GET UP AT EIGHT OR EVEN SEVEN A M CONSISTENTLY BUT THEY WERE ALSO ASKED TO MAXIMIZE AT OUTDOOR LIGHT EXPOSURE DURING THE MORNINGS FOR REASONS THAT IF YOU LISTEN TO THIS PODCAST BEFORE IF YOU HEARD ME TALK ABOUT BEFORE NOW THAT I'M CONSTANTLY TALKING ABOUT ALL PROBABLY GO INTO THE GRAVE SHOUTING PLEASE GET AS MUCH LIGHT EXPOSURE FROM SUNLIGHT EARLY IN THE DAY AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT SETS IN MOTION A HUGE NUMBER OF THINGS THAT AR BENEFICIAL FOR YOUR MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL HEALTH INCLUDING DOPAMIN PRODUCTION TIMEING MELOTONAN PRODUCTION CORRECTLY REDUCING CORDAS ALL PEAKS LATE IN THE DAY ET CETERA ET CETERA SO THEY ASKED THEM TO GET A LOT OF OUTDOOR LIGHT EXPOSURE THEY DIDN'T GIVE THEM A SPECIFIC AMOUNT WHAT THY SAID MAXIMIZE OUTDOOR LIGHT EXPOSURE DURING THE MORNINGS THE TIME BEFORE NOON AND AGAIN THEY HAVE THEM WAKING UP TWO TO THREE HOURS BEFORE THEIR HABITUAL WAKE UP TIME THEY WERE ALSO TOLD AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT IF YOU CAN A SHIFT YOUR SCHEDUAL EARLIER TO TRY AND KEEP SLEEP WAKE TIMES FIXED BETWEEN THEIR WORK DAYS AND THEIR WEAK ENDS SO NOT SLEEPING IN ON THE WEAK ENDS OR NOT HAVING ANY SLEEP IN DAYS REGARDLESS OF HOW WELL THEY SLEPT THE NIGHT BEFORE HOW FIXED WITHIN FIFTEEN TO THIRTY MINUTES OF THEIR PREDESIGNATED TIMES O IF THEY WERE WAKING UP AT SEVEN O'CLOCK ONE DAY THEY SET THEIR ALARM AND THEY MADE SURE THEY GOT OUT OF BED AT SEVEN O'CLOCK EVERY DAY PLUSS OR MINE US THIRTY MINUTES BUT NEVER LATER THAN SEVEN THIRTY NEVER EARLIER THAN SIX THIRTY PERTICIPANTS WERE ALSO ASKED TO TRYING GO TO SLEEP TWO TO THREE HOURS BEFORE THEIR HABITUAL BEDTIMES SO AGAIN THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO STAY UP LATELY A LEVEN P M PERHAPS BUT EVEN AS LATE AS ONE A M OR TWO A M AND NOW THEY ARE ASKED TO GO TO SLEEP TWO TO THREE HOURS BEFORE THEIR HABITUAL BED TI ME END TO WAKE UP TO TO THREE HOURS EARLIER AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THEY WERE ALSO TOLD AND I LOVE THIS BECAUSE IT FITS WITH MANY OF THE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT ON THIS PODCAST BEFORE TO TRY AND LIMIT LIGHT EXPOSURE DURING THE EVENINGS DIM THE LIGHTS OR LIMIT ALTOGETHER ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS LOT OF REASONS FOR THAT I COVER THAT IN THE MASTER SLEEP EPISODE I COVERED THAT IN THE OPTIMIZE HEALTH USING LIGHT EPISODE YOU CAN FIND THOSE AT HUBERMAN LAPDOT COME THEYRE ASKING THEM TO DO THAT HERE AND THEY ASK PARTICIPANTS TO KEEP A REGULAR SCHEDULE FOR THEIR DAILY MEALS NOT EATING ON THE HOUR CONSISTENTLY YOU KNOW AT NINE A M NOON THREE P M EXACTLY BUT WITHIN AGAIN ABOUT FIFTEEN TO THIRTY MINUTES THEY'RE ALWAYS EATING AT THE SAME TIMES THAT WAS ALSO IMPORTANT AND AGAIN THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE THESE SO CALLED FOOD AN TRAIN CIRCADIAN CLOCKS WHEN YOU EAT TELLS YOUR BODY WHEN TO BE ALERT AND WHEN YOU'RE NOT EATING WHEN TO BE ASLEEP AND THEY WERE TOLD TO NOT DRINK ANY CAFINE AFTER THREE P M IN THE AFTERNOON ANOTHER THEME THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ON THIS PODCAST THEY WERE ALSO TOLD NOT TO TAKE NAPS AFTER FOUR P M NAPS ARE AN INTERESTING FEATURE OF THE SLEEPWAKE CYCLE TO BE VERY BRIEF ABOUT THIS AND TO PULL FROM THE EPISODE THAT I DID WITH WORLD SLEEP EXPERT FROM UNIVERSY CALFORNIA BERKLY MAP WALKER NAPS ARE GREAT FOR MANY PEOPLE BUT DON'T NAP IF IT INTERFERES WITH YOUR NIGHT TIME SLEEP AND IN THIS STUDY THEY TOLD THEM DON'T NAP AFTER FOR P M AND IF YOU ARE A NAPPER DON'T NAP FOR MORE THAN NINETY MINUTES TEN MENUTE NAPS ARE FINE TWENTY MENUTE NAPS ARE FINE ZERO MINUTE NAPS ARE FINE BUT DON'T NAP FOR MORE THAN NINETY MINUTES AND DON'T NAP AFTER FOR P M AND TO EXERCISE DURING THE MORNING AW THIS ONE CAN BE A BIT CONTROVERSIAL BECAUSE I KNOW A LOT OF THE PTS OUT THERE AND LOT OF THE ON LYING UM YOU KNOW A JIM RATS AND PEOPLE WHO AND RUNNERS TO FOR THAT MATTER WE'LL SAY WELL  ACCORDING TO BODY TEMPERATURE AND RESEARCH IT'S BEST TO EXERCISE IN THE AFTERNOON LOOK IT'S BETTER TO EXERCISE SOME TIME AS OPPOSED TO NO TIME BUT IF YOU'RE FOCUST ON HOW TO SHIFT YOUR SCHEDULE EARLIER MEANING GET UP EARLY AND GO TO SLEEP EARLIER THIS STUDY HAD PEOPLE EXERCISE IN THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY CERTAINLY BEFORE TWO P M AND IDEALY BEFORE NOON SO AGAIN THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT STUDY BECAUSE IT COMBINES A LOT OF DIFFERENT VARIABLES TO ARRIVE AT THIS VERY IMPRESSIVE SHIFT WHERE PEOPLE CAN GET UP TWO TO THREE HOURS EARLIER AND THEN PRETTY CONSISTENTLY IN REFLECTIVELY START GOING TO BED TWO TO THREE HOURS EARLIER FEELING MORE LERT DURING THE DAY AGAIN IMPROVEMENTS AND COGNIVE PERFORMANCE MOOD AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE GRIP STRENGTH ET CETERA VERY FEW STUDIES ARE ABLE TO ARE WILLING TO TACKLE SO MANY VARIABLES AND COMBINE THEM IN ONE STUDY THIS PAPER I THINK DOES A MARVELLOUS JOB OF DOING THIS AND THIS INCORPORATNG THINGS THAT INDIVIDUALLY EACH HAVE SOME SUPPORT FOR THEM IN ANIMAL STUDIES AND PREVIOUS HUMAN STUDIES BUT AS FAR AS I KNOW THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW STUDIES THAT REALLY COMBINES ALL THESE DIFFERENT FEATURES IN ONE PLACE EATING TIMES KEEPING THOSE CONSISTENT GETTING MAXIMAL SUNLIGHT EXPOSURE EARLIER IN THE DAY GETTING UP AT A CONSISTENT TIME GOING TO SLEEP AT A CONSISTENT TIME AND ON IG ON IT'S A REALLY MARVELLOUS STUDY FOR THAT REASON AND I THINK FOR ANY OF YOU THAT ARE NIGHT OWLS AND ANY OF YOU THAT WANT TO REENFORCE YOUR EARLY WAKING AND EA LY TO BED TIMES AND I THINK FOR MOST ALL OF YOU WHO FALL INTO THAT GENERAL MIDDLE CATEGORY OF TEND TO GO TO SLEEP SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TEN P M AND MIDNIGHT AS THAT'S MOST PEOPLE AND TEND TO WAKE UP SOME TIME BETWEEN SIX A M AND AD A M WELL MAYBE YOU WANT TO BECOME MORE OF AN EARLY RISER OR MAYBE YOU ARE GOING TO TRAVEL OR THE SEASONS ARE CHANGING AND YOU WANT TO SHIFT YOUR TIME OR YOU OF A NEW JOB AT CETERA OR SOMETHING THAT'S ASHALLY VERY COMMON INTERMS OF RELATIONSHIP STRUGGLE YOU WANT TO MATCH YOUR WAKE SLEEP TIMES OR MAY BE WANT TO OFFSET YOUR WASTE LEEP TIMES FROM A SIGNIFICANOTHER THESE SORTS OF APPROACHES THAT I DESCRIBED HERE AND THAT ARE SUPPORTED BY THE DATA IN THIS PAPER ARE ABSOLUTELY POWERFUL AND SCIENCE SUPPORTED AND I'M CERTAIN THAT IF YOU WERE TO PLY THEM THAT YOU WOULD SEE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME EFFECTS THAT WERE OBSERVED HER E BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRON EFFORTS TO BRING ZERO COSTIC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE IN SIENS RELATTO TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS THLETIC GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND IN TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THE REASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GRENS AND THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETI GREENS ONCE OR TWICE A DAY IS THAT T HELPS ME COVER ALL OF MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGHT HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH OUR VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GUP MICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WITH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSENTIALLY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITHOUT LETIC GREENS IT GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED AND THE PROBIICS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIOM IF YOU LIKE TO TRIATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEYLL GIVE YOU FIV FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THREE K TOO THERE ARE TON OF DATAND OW SHOWING THAT VITEMAND THREE IS ESSENTIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH EVEN I F FOR GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICIEN IN VITEM IN D THREE AND K TOO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CAR EVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATHLETI GREENSTOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FIVFRE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMIND THREE K TO TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENTS IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOES OF ELECTROLITES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR VE TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLL OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLITES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AND ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIUM MANESIUM AND POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPERATIOS ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEM CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLITES ARE NOT PRESENT AND EFHYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OURE MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOU'RE GETTING THE PROPARATIOS OF ELECTROLYTES IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEEMENT DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMENT AND YOUL GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THEY'RE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT A TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENTE DOCOM SLASH HUBERMAN LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW TO OPTIMIZE AND INDEED HOW TO CONTROL YOUR BRAIN CHEMISTRY FOR SAKE OF HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE NOW IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE ALL NEED TO BE ON THE SAME PAGE ABOUT SOME BASIC FACTS SOME OF THOSE BASIC FACTS INVOLVE LEARNING SOME BASIC BIOLOGY I PROMISE THAT EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE A BIOLOGY YOUR CHEMISTRY BACKGROUND EVERYTHING I'M ABOUT TO SAY SHOULD BE ACCESSIBLE AND CLEAR TO YOU THE IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW IS THAT YOUR BRAIN AND YOUR SPINAL CORD AND THE REST OF YOUR SO CALLED NERVOUS SYSTEM CONTROLL ALL THE ORGANS OF YOUR BODY AND THAT ALL THE ORGANS OF YOUR BODY FEED BACK MEANING THEY COMMUNICATE THROUGH CHEMICALS ANDOTHER MEANS TO YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM NOW YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM PLAYS A PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT ROLL IN GENERATING EVERYTHING FROM SLEEP TO WAKEFULNESS CREATIVITY STRESS CALM ET CETERA BY WAY OF A PARTICULAR TYPE OF CELL CELL INTERACTION AND THAT'S CALLED SCYNAPTIC COMMUNICATION WHAT IS SCYNAPED IC COMMUNICATION WELL IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THAT LET'S DIAL BACK ALA BIT FURTHER AND TRY AND UNDERSTAND FOR A MOMENT WHAT MAKES UP YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IN ITS SIMPLEST FORM YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IS MADE OF NERVE CELLS THAT WE CALL NURONSE NURONS COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER THROUGH CHEMICALS THEY RELEASE CERTAIN CHEMICALS THAT MAKE OTHER NURONS MORE OR LESS LIKELY TO BE ELECTRICALLY ACTIVE WHAT DO MEAN BY ELECTRICALLY ACTIVE WE MEAN AS IT SOUNDS ELECTRICITY PASSING DOWN THROUGH CELLS AND THEN LITERALLY CAUSING ELECTRICITY IN OTHER CELLS THE SIMPLEST WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS MAYBE WHEN YOU WERE A KID OR MAY BEVEN S TILL NOW YOU WOULD WEAR SOCKS AND YOU SHUFFLE ALONG THE FLOOR TO GENERATE SOME STATIC ELECTRICITY AND YOU TOUCH SOMEONE AND YOU CHOCK THEM WITH YOUR FINGER I'M YOUNGER BROTHERS OD OCCASIONALLY DO THAT TO MY SISTER ID FRIENDS WE  DO THAT TO ONE ANOTHER I KNOW IT'S KIND OF SILLY AN CHILDISH YET IT ILLUSTRATES THE PRINCIPLE THAT WE CAN GENERATE ELECTRICITY AND PASS ELECTRICITY TO OTHER BEINGS OR IN THE CASE OF NURONS FROM ONE NURON TO THE NECTS THE WAY NURONS DO THAT IS THAT IN BETWEEN THE NURONS TE LITTLE SPACES THOSE LITTLE SPACES ARE CALLED SCYNAPSES AND NURONS LITERALLY VOMIT WELL THEY DON'T LITERALLY VOMIT BUT THEY RELEASE LITTLE PACKETS OF SO CALLED TRANSMITTER CHEMICAL INTO THAT SPACE WE CALL A SYNAPS IT TRAVELS ACROSS THE SCYNAPS IT A TATCHES TO THE CELL ON THE OTHER SIDE THE OTHER NURON AND THEN DEPENDING ON WHAT THAT CHEMICAL IS IT EITHER MAKES THAT NEXT NURON MORE ELECTRICALLY ACTIVE OR LESS ELECTRICALLY ACTIVE SO CALLED EXCITATION IT EITHER EXCITES THE NEXT NURON TO BE ELECTRICALLY ACTIVE ALSO OR IT INHIBITS IT PREVENTS THE NEXT NURON FROM BEING ELECTRICALLY ACTIVE SO AGAIN VERY SIMPLY WE HAVE NERVE CELLS THAT COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER THROUGH ELECTRICITY AND CHEMICALS THAT INSPIRE THAT ELECTRICITY AND THE LITTLE GAPS BETWEEN NURONS ARE CALLED SCYNAPSES YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT I'M CERTAIN YOU CAN MAKE IT THROUGH THE REST OF THE EPISODE AND THAT YOU WILL GET ALL THE DEPTH AND IMPORTANT DETAIL THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW BUT I WANT TO GO JUST A LITTLBIT FURTHER AND EXPLAIN THAT NURONS DON'T JUST TALK ONE TO ONE THERE ARE TRILIANS OF NURONS IN YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT ALLOW YOU TO BE HAPPY TO BE IN LOVE TO BE SAD TO BE IN GRIEF TO REMEMBER THINGS AND SO ON AND WHAT YOU DO AT ANY MOMENT WHAT YOU FEEL IN WHAT YOU THINK RELATES TO WHICH SO CALLED NURAL CIRCUITS ARE ACTIVE SO A LOT TIMES WE THING ABOUT BRAIN AREAS AND WE'VE ALL SEEN THESE PICTURES OF THE BRAIN WHERE YOU KNOW SOME ONE WAS IN A EPHEMORI SCANNER OR THEY WERE IN A BRAIN SKINNER OF SOME SORT AND THEY SAW A PICTURE OF SOMETHING AND A CERTAIN ARY OF THE BRAIN LIGHTS UP AS IT'S CALLED THAT LIGHTING UP OT THE BRAIN REALLY REFLECTS THE ACTIVITY OF HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSAND MAY BEVEN MILLIONS OF NURONS IN THAT REGION THOSE IMAGES OF BRAIN AREAS LIGHTING UP AND INDEED TALKING OUT BRAIN AREAS LIGHTING UP CAN BE ELBIT OR ALLOTMIS LEADING BECAUSE IN FACT NO SINGLE BRAIN AREA CONTROLS ANY ONE SINGLE PERCEPTION OR BEHAVIOR OR FEELING STATE RATHER WE HAVE SO CALLED NURAL CIRCUITS CHAINS OF NURONS CHAINS OF SPECIFIC NURONS THAT IS THAT CREATE DIFFERENT STATES OF MIND THAT LEAD TO SPECIFIC BEHAVIORS THAT LEAD TO SPECIFIC EMOTIONAL STATES AND THOSE NURAL CIRCUITS ARE MADE UP OF LOTS OF DIFFERENT BRAIN ARAS THAT LIGHT UP IN PARTICULAR SEQUENCES AND WHEN I SAY LAID LIGHT UP SCUS ME WHAT I MEAN IS THAT PARTICULAR BRAIN AREAS EITHER EXCITE OR PREVENT THE ECITATION THAT IS THEY INHIBIT OTHER BRAIN AREAS IN A PARTICULAR SEQUENE MUCH LIKE KEYS ON A PIANO PLAYED IN A PARTICULAR SEQUENCE MAKES UP A PARTICULAR SONG PARTICULAR BRAIN AREAS ACTIVATED OR MADE CILENT IN A PARTICULAR SEQUENCE LEADS TO A PARTICULAR BEHAVIOR LIKE GETTING UP OUT OF A CHAIR OR A PARTICULAR FEELING STATE LIKE BEING PARTICULARLY HAPPY ONE DAY WHEN YOU WAKE UP OR PARTICULARLY DEPRESSED WHETHER NOT THAT DEPRESSION IS CAUSED BY A LIFE EVENT OR WHETHER NOT IT ARISES SPONTANEOUSLY SO WE HAVE NURONS WE HAVE SCYNAPSES AND WE HAVE NURAL CIRCUITS AND VITALLY IMPORTANT IS THE FACT THAT WHICH NURAL CIRCUITS ARE ACTIVE AND WHICH NURAL CIRCUITS ARE LIKELY TO BE LESS ACTIVE AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT DEPENDS ON TWO MAJOR CATEGORIES OF CHEMICALS IT DEPENDS ON HORMONS AND IT DEPENDS ON SO CALLED NEURALMODULATOR S NOW WERE MAINLY GOING TO FOCUS ON NEUROMODULATORS TO DAY BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT IF YOU CAN LEARN TO CONTROL THEM AND INDEED THERE ARE TOOLS TO CONTROL THEM THEN YOU CAN CONTROL WHICH NEURAL CIRCUITS ARE MORE LIKELY OR LESS LIKELY TO BE ACTIVE IN YOU AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT AND IN DOING SO YOU CON CONTROL WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE GOING TO BE ALERT AND FOCUST OR DEEPLY ASLEEP YOU CON CONTROL WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE GOING TO BE IN A CREATIVE STATE OR WHETHER NOT YOU ARE GOING TO BE IN A STATE OF MIND MORE FIT MOR CAPABLE THAT IS OF DOING FOCUST WORK OR MATH OR MORE SO CALLED LINEAR TYPES OF WORK WHERE THERE'S A CORRECT ANSER THERE'S A SPECIFIC THING TO FOLLOW IN YOUR SIMPLY GOING TO PLUG AN CHUG AS IT WERE THROUGH A PARTICULAR SET OF STEPS IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING OR FOR INSTANCE WHETHER NOT YOU ARE GOING TO BE IN AN MORE RELAXED IN CREATIVE STATE WHERE YOURE THINKING ABOUT NEW IDEAS OR NEW IDEAS ARE JUST SEEM TO BE SPONTANEOUSLY COMING TO MIND OLL OF THAT CAN BE CONTROLED TO A CON SIDERABLE EXTENT BY LEVERAGING THESE SO CALLED NEUROMODULATORS WHAT ARE NEUROMODULATORS NEUROMODULATORS OR PARTICULAR CHEMICALS THAT MAKE IT LIKELY THAT CERTAIN NEURL CIRCUITS WILL BE ACTIVE AND NOT OTHERS AND THE FOUR NUROMODULATORS THAT WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT TO DAY THAT ARE OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE OR YOUR GOALS OR DOPOMINE EPINEPRAN ALSO CALLED A DRENOLIN SERATONAN AND A SETAL COLING THAT'S DOPOMING EPINEPRON CERATONAN AND A SETO CLING TO DAY I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU HOW EACH OF THOSE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF NERMODULATORS WORK AND THE THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO TO CONTROL THOSE NAUROMODULATORS THAT IS INCREASE THEM OR DECREASE THEM THROUGH BEHAVIORAL TOOLS AND SUPPLEMENTATION IN WAYS THAT ALLOW YOU TO ACCESS THE BRAIN AND BODY STATES THAT YOU WANT AT THE TIMES THAT YOU WANT JUST VERY QUICKLY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOW NEUROMODULATORS ARE ABLE TO WORK REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT ITS DOPOMINE OR CERATONAN OR EPINEPRIN ET CETERA THERE ARE MANY FEATURES OF HOW NAUROMODULATORS WORK BUT FOR SAKE OF TO DAY'S DISCUSSION WE ONLY NEED TO FOCUS ON TWO OF THOSE FEATURES AND THOSE ARE FAST ACTING FEATURES AND LONGER SLOWER FEATURES OR WHAT WE CALL BASE LINE FEATURES WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT WHEN I SAY FASTER OR BASE LINE WELL CONSIDER THAT AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT WHETHER NOT YOUR SLEEP OR AWAKE WHETHER NOT ITS MORNING OR AFTERNOON OR NIGHT YOU HAVE SOME AMOUNT OF DOPOMING BEING RELEASED IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY SOME AMOUNT OF CERATONEN SOME AMOUNT OF EPINEFRAN AND SOME AMOUNT OF A SETO COALING IT IS RARELY IF EVER THE CASE THAT YOU HAVE ZERO DOPOMINE OR ZERO CRATONENT AN SO OFTEN WE HEAR ABOUT SOME ONE BEING DOPOMING DEPLEADED OR THESE DAYS YOU HEAR ALOT ABOUT THAT ANYWAYS OR YOU'LL HERE THAT PEOPLES CERATONAN IS BOTTOMD OUT IN REALITY NONE OF THESE NAUROMODULTORS EVER DIS A PEER COMPLETELY BUT THEY TEND TO BE PRESENT AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OR DIFFERENT RELATIVE LEVELS ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING TO POINT OUT IS THAT THEY DON'T WORK ALONE IN FACT AS YOU'LL SOON LEARN DOPEMINE AND EPINEPRAN ARE CLOSE COUSINS THAT COLLABORATE IN TERMS OF CREATING STATES OF FOCUS AN MOTIVATION FOR INSTANCE OR IN CREATING STATES OF ENERGY AND THE PURSUIT OF PARTICULAR GOALS I SAY THEI'RE CLOSE COUSINS WHAT I MEAN IS THAT THEY TEND TO IMPACT SOME OF THE SAME NERL CIRCUITS AND BELIEVE IT ARE NOT DOPOMINE AND EPINEFERAN ARE CHEMICALLY RELATED TO IL JUST TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THAT EPINEPRAN IS ACTUALLY DERIVED FROM DOPOMINE CHEMICALLY EPINEPFERAN THAT IS ADRENOLINE IS MADE FROM THE MOLECULE DOPOMINE NOW DOPEMINE AND CERATONAN CAN ALSO WORK TOGETHER TO IMPACK CERTAIN CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN BUT IN LARGE PART THEY OPERATE ON SEPARATE CIRCUITS AND A SETOCOLINE WHICH YOU'LL SOON LEARN IS INVOLVED IN STATES OF FOCUS AND CAN ACTUALLY OPEN UP CAN LITERALLY CREATE STATES IN THE MIND IN WHICH YOUR BRAIN IS MORE PLASTIC AND ABLE TO CHANGE AND LEARN MORE QUICKLY WELL A SEETO COLING CAN DO THAT ON ITS OWN BUT RARELY DOES IT DO IT ON ITS OWN MORE TYPICALLY IT GETS A SISTENCE FROM SOME OF THE OTHER NEROMODULATORS NOW THAT MIGHT SEEM LIKE IT COMPLICATES THE PICTURE BUT IT ACTUALLY MAKES THE PICTURE FAR SIMPLER BECAUSE WHAT WE CAN SAY FOR SURE IS THAT THE FAST ACTIONS OF DOPOMINE ERE THE FAST ACTIONS OF EPINEFERAN CERETONAN OR A CETO COLING ARE ACTIONS THAT OCCUR ON THE ORDER OF SECONDS OR MINUTES OR UP TO ABOUT AN HOUR OR SO WHERE AS THE SLOWER ACTIONS OF THOSE NEUROMODULATORS TEND TO OCCUR ON THE ORDER OF HOURS DAYS OR EVEN WEEKS NOW PERHAPS SURPRISINGLY I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON THE SLOW ACTIONS OF THE NEROMODULATORS FIRST BECAUSE THOSE SLOW ACTIONS OF THE NEROMODULATORS ARE HAPPENING IN YOU AND IN ME AND IN EVERYONE RIGHT NOW AND THEY SET THE BACKDROP THE CONTEXT IN WHICH THE VARIOUS TOOLS TO MANIPULATE DOPOMINE EPINEFERAN CERETONAN OR A SETOCOLING WILL WORK WHAT DO I MEAN BY THE CONTEXT OR THE BACKDROP OR THE BASE LINE WELL IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE AWAKE DURING THE DAYTIME AN A SLEEP AT NIGHT I DO REALIZE THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO BE DOING SHIFT WORK OR THE RAISING YOUNG CHILDREN OR THAT MIGHT HAVE A SICK PERSON AT HOME THAT THEIR TENDING TO AT CETERA OR EVEN AVINSOMNIA THEIR TENDING TO THEM SO SCHEDUALS OF SLEEP AND WAKEFULNESS WILL VARY BUT IN GENERAL EVERYBODY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT YOUR NOCTURNAL OR YOUR SO CALL DIRN ONL YOUR WATURING THE DAY PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY FALLOWS A SCHEDUL IN WHICH FROM ZERO TO NINE HOURS AFTER WAKING THAT IS FROM THE TIME YOU WAKE UP UNTIL A BOUT NINE HOURS LATER THE NEUROMODULATORS DOPEMINE AND EPINEPERAN TEND TO BE AT THEIR HIGHEST S LEVELS THAT THEY WILL BE AT ANY POINT IN THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR PERIOD IN ANY PERIOD OF THE DAY SO WE CAN CALL THIS ZERO TO NINE HOUR PERIOD PASE ONE OF THE DAYJUS FOR SIMPLICITY AND I'VE REFERRED TO THIS BEFORE IN A PREVIOUS EPISODE BUT NOT IN THIS EXACT CONTEXT FROM NINE TO ABOUT SIXTEEN HOURS IS WHAT WE WILL CALL PASE TWO AND THAT'S WHEN DOPAMINE AND EPINEPRAN LEVELS TEN TO SUBSIDE A BIT COMPARED TO THE EARLIER PASE ONE PART OF THE DAY AND SERATONAN LEVELS START TO INCREASE AND THEN PASE THREE OF THE TWENTY FOR HOUR CYCLE WHICH IS FROM ABOUT AND AGAIN ABOUT THE ZEROPROXIMATES FROM ABOUT SEVENTEEN HOURS AFTER WAKING UNTIL ABOUT TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER WAKING IS PASE THREE OF THE DAY AND DURING THAT TIME THERE IS CHAOS IN TERMS OF WHICH NEUROMODULATORS ARE MOST PRESENT IN THE BRAIN AND WHI CHAOS WHAT I MEAN IS THAT DURING SLEEP YOU HAVE INCREDIBLE PEAKS IN THE SEATAL COLLING AND DROPS IN A SEATAL COLLING YOU 'VE INCREDIBLE PEAKS IN DOPAMING AND DROPS IN DOPAMI YOU'VE INCREDIBLE PEAKS AND CERATONAN AND DROPS IN CERATONE MOST OFTEN YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SEE MUCH IF ANY RELEASE OF EPINEPRAN DRENALIN AND THAT'S BECAUSE EPINEPRAN ALSO CALLED A DRENDALIN TENDS TO WAKE US UP AND PUT US INTO ACTION MODE BEHAVIORS AND THAT SIMPLY NOT HAPPENING DURING SLEEP BUT FOR THE OTHER THREE NEUROMODULATORS ACROSS THE NIGHT IT'S SORT OF CHAOS YOU'VE GOT PEAKS AND DROPS AND PEAKS AND DROPS IN DIFFERENT COMMINATIONS THAN YOU WOULD EVER SEE IN WAKEFULNESS AND THIS PLAYS IMPORTANT ROLLS IN DREAMING IN PORTANT ROLLS IN SOME OF THE REPARATIVE FUNCTIONS OF SLEEP THE POINT IS THAT DURING THAT PASE THREE THE LEVELS OF NEUROMODULATORS ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE BUT IT'S NOT RANDOM IT I SAY IT'S CHAOS BUT IT'S ORGANIZE ACCORDING TO THE SPECIFIC REPARATIVE GOLLS OF SLEEP THE SPECIFIC METABOLIC ROLLS OF SLEEP ET CETERA WERE NOT KIN A FOCUS TOO MUCH ON PHASE THREE TO DAY BECAUSE PASE THREE OF THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR CYCLE THAT SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR HOUR PERIOD IS ONE IN WHICH YOU OUGHT TO BE DEEPLY ASLEEP WHETHER NOT YOU'RE NOCTURNAL OR DIURNAL RIGHT SEVENTEEN HOURS AFTER WAKING YOU OUGHT TO BE ASLEEP AND THERE ARE A LOT OF EPISODES OF THIS PODCAST AND INDEED TODAY I STARTED TALKING OUT TWO PARTICULAR STUDIES RELATED TO SLEEP THERE A LOT OF TOOLS TO ENHANCE SLEEP ET CETERA AND OF COURSE THERE ARE THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO IN THE LATE PORTION OF PHASE TWO OF THE DAY IN ORDER TO ENHANCE YOUR TRANSITION TIME INTO AND DEPTH OF SLEEP BUT YOU CAN'T REALLY DO MUCH DURING SLEEP YOU'RE NOT TAKEN SUPPLEMENTS YOURE NOT DOING BREATHING PRACTICE IS TERE THINGS TO FALL BACK ASLEEP ARE NOT REALY DOING MUCH DURING SLEEP SO WE'RE MAINLY GOING TO PFOCUS ON WHAT WE'RE CALLING PASE ONE AND PASE TO PASE ONE BEING THIS DOPAMINE EPINEPRAN DOMINATED PHASE OF OUR DAY AND PASE TWO BEING THIS MORE CERA TO NERGIC OR CERATONAN DOMINATED PORTION OF THE DAY AND THEN YOU MIGHT SAY WHAT ABOUT A SEATAL COLING FORGOT ABOUT A SEATO C LING WELL WE DIDN'T FORGET ABOUT A SETOCALLING A SETO COLING IS UNDER CONTROL MORE IN TERMS OF WHAT WE HAPPEN TO BE DOING AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT WHETHER NOT WERE FOCUSING OR NOT FOCUSSING WHETHER NOT WERE LEARNING OR NOT LEARNING AND HERE I'M REFERRING DOASETO CALLING SPECIFICALLY IN THE CONTECT OF THE BRAIN AND THINKING BECAUSE AS SOME OF YOU ARE PROBABLY SHOUTING OUT THERE RIGHT IF YOUR EXERCISE PHOR ZEOLOGISTS OR YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HOW THE BRAIN CONTROLS MOVEMENT A SEDOCOLING IS USED AT THE NERVE TO MUSCLE CYNAPS RIGHT SO NURONS DON'T JUST CONTROL OTHER NURONS ELECTRICALLY THE WAY YOU ARE ABLE TO MOVE IN FACT AS BECAUSE NURONS ARE CONTROLING THE ELECTRIC ACTIVITY OF MUSCLES LITERLLY THE CONTRACTION OF MUSCLE FIBRES AND THAT CONTROL IS EXERTED THROUGH THE RELEASE OF A SETO CLLING SO CEITOCOLING IS WORKING AT MUSCLES AS WELL BUT WERE NOT FOCUSED ON THAT TO DAY WE'RE FOCUSSED ON WHAT WE CAN DO DURING PHASE ONE OF THE DAY AND WHAT WE CAN DO DURING PHASE TOO OF THE DAY TO CONTROL THE SPECIFIC NEUROMODULATORS DOPAMING UPAN EFFERENCE ERETONAN AIN A SETO COLING TOWARD PARTICULAR ENGOLLS AND AS I'VE BEEN HARPING ON FOR THE LAST FIVE ER TEN MINUTES OR SO IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT IN THE EARLY PASE ONE PART OF THE DAY AGAIN ZERODONINE HOURS DOPAMING AN EPINEFFRAN ALREADY DOMINATE THE NUROMALTULATOR LANDSCAPE THAT IS THEY ARE ALREADY ELEVATED AND THEN THEY WILL TAPER OFFIN FASE TOO WHEREAS IN PHASE TOO OF THE DAY SERATONAN TENDS TO DOMINATE MORE THAN DOPAMIN AN EPINEFERAN AND SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT IF YOUR GOAL IS TO INCREASE SERATONAN IN ORDER TO GET SOME PARTICULAR EFFECT ON YOUR MENTAL PERFORMANCE OR PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE OR HEALTH OR IF YOUR GOAL IS TO INCREASE YOUR DOPAMINE OR EPINEFERAN TO GET SOME PARTICULAR EFFECT ON YOUR MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE ET CETERA WELL THEN YOU NEED TO CONSIDER WHAT THE BACK ROUND LEVEL OF DOPAMINE OR EPINEFERAN OR SERATONAND HAPPENS TO BE BECAUSE IN DOING SO YOU WILL KNOW WHICH TOOL TO SELECT AND HOW HARD YOU NEED TO PUSH ON THAT TOOL RIGHT IF YOUR LEVELS OF DOPAMING ARE ALREADY RIDING PRETTY HIGH BECAUSE IT'S THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY WELL THEN IT DOESN'T TAKE A WHOLE LOT MORE TO GET DOPAMING TO A LEVEL IN WHICH IT CAN FOR INSTANCE CHANGE YOUR LEVEL OF MODIVATION WHEREAS IF YOU ARE IN THE LATE PART OF THE DAY LET'S SAY EIGHT OR NINE P M AND YOU HAVE A LOT OF SERATONAN SWIMMING AROUND IN YOUR SYSTEM AND YOU REALLY NEED TO BE FOCUSED AND ALERT WELL YOU CAN DO THAT BY LEVERAGING THE DOPAMINE AND EPINEFFERENCE SYSTEM AND INDEED THE ASEITO COLLING SYSTEM TOO BUT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RESORT TO TOOLS THAT CAN DO THAT FAR MORE POTENTLY AND THAT CAN DO THAT IN MUCH MORE SESTAINED WAY IF YOU ARE GOING TO ACCESS THE STATE THAT YOU WANT SO AGAIN IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE BACK DROP OF THESE NEUROMODULATORS IS THE SO CALE BASE LIN AND THAT THEY VARY ACROSS THE DAY IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE TOOLS TO OPTIMIZE YOUR BRAIN CHEMISTRY ANY ONE THAT TELLS YOU DO THIS PROTOCAL IN ORDER TO INCREASE YOUR DOPOMINE DO THIS PROTOCOLOR TAKE THIS SUPPLEMENT TO INCREASE YOUR SERETONEN THEY CAN BE TELLING YOU THE ABSOLUTE TRUTH BUT IF YOU DON'T CONSIDER THE BACK DROP OVER WHICH THAT SUMPLEMENTS OR BEHAVIOR IS GOING TO HAVE ITS EFFECT WELL THEN YOU CAN'T REALLY PREDICT THE EFFECT IT WILL HAVE BUT IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THESE BACKDROP BASE LINE ELEMENTS TO HAVE NERMODULATORS WORK WEL THN YOU'RE NATERIFIC POSITION TO LEVERAGE THE BEST TOOLS IN THE IMMEDIATE AND SHORT TERMIN THAT IS ON THE ORDER SECONDS MINUTES AND HOURS BEFORE WE DIVE IN TO THE MORE POINTED DIRECTED EFFECTS OF SPECIFIC TOOLS ON NAROMODULATORS LIKET OF JUST BRIEFLY MENTION HORMONES BECAUSE THEY ARE ALSO IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING THE BACKROUND AND THE CONTEXT AND THESE BASE LINE LEVELS OF NAROMODULATORS AN HERE I'M GOING TO PAINT WITH A BIT OF A BROAD BRUSH BUT WHAT I WILL SAY IS ACCURATE EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT NOT BE EXHAUSTIVE WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS EVERYTHING IM ABOUT TO SAY IS TRUE BUT IT DOESN'T COVER EVERY EXAMPLE IN DETAIL AND NUANTSD POSSIBILITY OUT THERE HORMONES HAVE MANY DIFFERENT EFFECTS ON THE BRAIN AND BODY AND NOT UNLIKE NERMODULATORS SOME OF THOSE EFFECTS ARE VERY FAST SOME OF THEM ARE VERY SLOW IN FACT CERTAIN HORMONES FOR INSTANCE THE STEROID HORMONES LIKE ESTROGEN AND LIKE TESTOSTRONE AND CORTICOSTERONES AND HERE OF COURSE I'M REFERRING TO THE STEROID HORMONES FOR WHAT THEY ARE THEY ARE INDEED STEROID HORMONES BUT I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT STEROIDS THAT PEOPLE INJECT FOR SPORTS PERFORMANCE OR FOR PHYSICAL AUGMENTATION ON TALKING BOUT THESE STEROID HORMONES THAT YOU MAKE NATURALLY BECAUSE INDEED YOU MAKE THESE NATURALLY WELL THE STEROID HORMONES CAN ACTUALLY CONTROL GENE EXPRESSION THEY CAN CHANGE THE IDENTITY OF CELLS AND THE GENES AND PROTINES THAT SCELLS EXPRESS THIS IS WHY DURING PUBERITY FOR INSTANCE TESTOSTRON AN ESTROGEN ARE RELEASED INTO THE BODY GROWTHHORMONA'S RELEASED INTO THE BODY AND BODIES AND VOICES AND PERSONALITIES AND BRAINS CHANGE TREMENDOUSLY BECAUSE LITERALLY THERE IS A TRANSFORMATION OF THE BREST TISSUE OF THE TESTICULAR TISSUE OF THE OVARIAN TISSUE OF THE BONES OF THE MUSCLES OF THE TISSUES AND A CELLS THAT CONTROL HAIR GROWTH GENE EXPRESSION CHANGES IN ALL THOSE CELL TYPES AND THE CHILD BECOMES AN ADOLESCEN BECOMES A YOUNG ADULT I THAT'S WHAT PUBERITY REALLY IS IN FACT PUBERTY IS PERHAPS THE MOST DRAMATIC TRANSFORMATION THAT WE GO THROUGH AND OUR ENTIRE LIFESPAN IN TERMS OF OUR AGENTCAUSE INDEED IT REFLECTS A VERY RAPID I SHOULD MENTION PERIOD OF AGENT AND TRANSFORMATION OF THE IDENTITY OF CELLS SO STEROID HORMONES AND OTHER HORMONES CAN HAVE VERY SLOW LONG LASTING ACTIONS IN THAT WAY THEY CAN ALSO HAVE VERY FAST ACTIONS SO FOR INSTANCE A DRENOLIN EPINEFERIN RELEASE FROM THE ADRENAL GLANDS CAN IMMEDIATELY MAKE YOUR ART BEAT FASTOR CAN IMMEDIATELY CHANGE THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF UR BLOOD VESSELS AND ARTERIES AND CAPILLARIES AND CHANGE THE WAY BLOOD FLOWS IT CAN CHANGE THE WAY YOU SEE THE WORLD LITERALLY IT DOES CHANGE THE WAY YOU SEE THE WORLD THROUGH YOUR VISUAL SYSTEM AND THAT ALL HAPPENS ON THE ORDER OF HUNDREDS OF MILLISECONS OR SECONDS ES ARE EXTREMELY FAST ACTIONS CORTICOSTEROIN ALSO CAN HAVE FAST ACTIONS AND SLOW ACTIONS BUT SINCE THIS ISN'T A DISCUSSION ABOUT HORMONES PERSAY AND WE'VE DONE ENTIRE EPISODES LIKE THE OPTOMIZE TESTOSTERON AN ESTOGEN EPISODE YOU CAN FINE THAT AT HUBERMAN LAPDOT CALM OR THE INTERVIEW WITH THE INCREDIBLY KNOWLEDGIBLE AND CLEAR AND REALLY WONDERFUL A TUDOR OF ACTIONABLE INFORMATION DOCTOR CALGULETE WHO IS ALSO ON THIS POTGETS YOU CAN LEARN A LOT ABOUT HORMONS THERE TODAY WE WANT TO THINK ABOUT HORMONES AS THEY RELATE TO THESE NEROMODULATORS THE DOPOMING CERATONAN EPINEFERAN AND A SITO COLING AND IN GENERAL TESTOSTERONE TENDS TO COLLABORATE WITH AND INCREASE THE ACTION OF DOPOMINE THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE BUT IN GENERAL WHEN TESTOSTERON GOES UP DOPOMINE GOES UP AND SOMETIMES EVEN VICEVERSA WHEN DOPOMIN GOES UP TESTOCERAN GO UP AND THIS IS TRUE FOR BOTH MALES AND FOR FEMALES IN GENERAL WHEN CORTICOSTERONES LIKE CORTIS ALL AND SOME RELATED STERID HORMONES INCREASE EPINEFERAN LEVELS GO UP AND IN GENERAL WHEN HORMONES LIKE OXY TOSEN OR PROLACTON ARE INCREASED LEVELS OF CERITONAN GO UP WE CAN'T DRAW DIRECT LINK BETWEEN ANY ONE HORMONE SYSTEM AND A SEIDO COLING ASIDTO COLING CONTISITS OFF IN A CATEGORY OF ITS OWN IN THAT WAY BUT AGAIN IN GENERAL TESTOSTERONE AND DOPOM INTEND TO COLLABORATE IN THE SAME DIRECTION CORTIS ALL AND EPINEFRAN TEND TO COLLABORATE IN THE SAME DIRECTION OXYTOSEN AND PROLACTIN WHICH ARE HORMONES AND CERATONAN TEND TO COLLABORATE IN THE SAME DIRECTION AND THEN WE HAVE POORLD LONELY ACITOCOLING OFF ON ITS OWN BUT IT'S NOT POOR AND LONELY IT ACTUALLY HAS INCREDIBLY POTEN EFFECTS ON ITS OWN SO IT'S REALLY THAT IT JUST DOESN'T MEAN MUCH HELP FROM THE HORMON SYSTEMS OR LEAST NOT THE STEROID HORMON SYSTEMS IN ORDER TO HAVE ITS TREMENDOUS EFFECTS NOW LOT OF WHAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT AND WILL DO WHEN TRYING TO IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL HEALTH IS THEY WILL TRY AND INCREASE OR DECREASE CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF HORMONES OF THE SORT THAT I MENTION TESTOSTERONESTEROGEN NOXITOSIN PROLACTON SO O BUT OFTENTIMES THE EFFECTS OF THOSE MANIPULATIONS IN HORMONES THAT ARE GOING TO BE MOST SALIENT ARE NOT GOING TO BE DUE TO THE DIRECT EFFECTS OF THOSE HORMONS SOMETIMES IT COULD BE BUT OFTENTIMES IT'S GOING TO BE DUE TO THEIR EFFECTS ON THE BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM BY WAY OF HOW THOSE HORMONES IMPACT NEROMODULATORS SO FOR INSTANCE THERE ARE VARIOUS THINGS THAT PEOPLE CAN DO BOTH MEN AND WOMEN TO INCREASE THEIR TESTOSTERONE AND ESTERGEN IN THE APPROPRIATE RATIOS A TALKED ABOUT ONE SUCH A PRO CH PREVIOUS EPISODE AND THAT IS TO GET SUNLIGHT ON TO A LARGE PORTION OF ONE SKIN EACH DAY BELIEVE ARE NOT THIS ACTUALLY WORKS AND IT WORKS BECAUSE YOUR SKIN IS ACTUALLY AN ENDECRINE ORGAN A HORMONE SECRETING ORGAN THE BEAUTIFUL STUDY IVE COVERED IN ON THIS POD CAS BEFORE WE WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO THE STUDY AGAIN BUT IT HAD PEOPLE SPEND AT LEAST TWENTY MINUTES OR SO CLOSER TO THIRTY MINUTES EACH DAY TRINY MACIMIZE SUNLIGHT EXPOSURE TO AS MUCH OF THEIR SKIN AS THEY COULD IN TERMS OF STILL MAINTAINING DECENT EXPOSURE MEANING NOT OVER EXPOSING THEMSELVES IN A CULTURAL WAY MEANING WEARING ENOUGH CLOTHES THAT THEY WERE DECENT BUT STILL GETTING A LOT OF SUN EXPOSURE COUPLETIMES PER WEEK OR MORE WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT PEOPLE'S TESTOSTRON AND ESTROGEN LEVELS WENT UP FEELINGS OF WELL BEING WENT UP FEELINGS OF WELL WHERE I SHOULD SAY INCREASES IN LEBIDO WERE OBSERVED AS WELL THE SUBJECTIVELY REPORTED MORE PASSION ET CETERA TESTOSTRONE AND ESTROGEN DID INDEED BOTH GO UP AND AGAIN I WANT A HIGHLIGHT THAT INCREASES IN ESTEROGEN NOCOUS TESTSTRONE ARE RELATED TO INCREASES IN LEIBIDO IN BOTH MEN AND WOMEN ISS WHY YOU NEVER WANT A CRUSHER ESTEROGEN DOWN TO ZERO WHETHER NOT YOUR MALE OR FEMALE IF YOU WANT TO MAINTAIN SOME SORT OF HEALTHY LEBIDO AND GENERAL FEELINGS OF WELL BEING UNRELATED TO LIBIDO WELL MANY OF THOSE EFFECTS WE KNOW ARE NOT DUE TO DIRECT EFFECTS OF TESTOSTERONE AND ESTROGEN BUT RATHER ARE DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF TESTOSTERONE AND ESTEROGEN ON THE NEUROMODULATORS DOPOMINE AND CERATONAN BECAUSE MUCH OF LEBDO AND FEELINGS OF WELL BEING AND FEELINGS OF RELAXATION BUT ALSO DESIRE MOTIVATION ET CETERA ORIGINATE BECAUSE OF THE ACTIVATION OF NEURAL CIRCUITS THAT DOPOMINE CONTROLS AND PROMOTES AND THAT CERATONAN PROMOTE AND CONTROL SO THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND AS WE MOVE TOWARD MORE SPECIFIC DISCUSSION OF THE CHEMICALS THAT WE CALL NEUROMODULATORS BECAUSE HORMONES ARE CONTROLLING THOSE NEUROMODULATORS IN A VERY SLOW MODULATORY WAY SO YES I SAID IT HORMONES MODULATE NEUROMODULATORS SORT OF SAID IT TWICE ON PURPOSE AND THIS IS A DRAMATIC AND POTENT EFFECT O JUST GIVE YOU ONE MORE EXAMPLE THE HORMONE PROLACTIN TENDS TO BE ANTAGONISTIC IT TENDS TO REDUCE AMOUNTS OF DOPOMINOR WERE AT LEAST WHEN PROLACTIN LEVELS ARE HIGH DOPOMINE LEVELS TEND TO BE LOWER YOU OBSERVE THIS AFTER THE BIRTH OF A NEU CHILE YOU OBSERVE THIS POST QOIDILY AFTER MATING IN ALL SPECIES HUMANS AND ANIMALS WHEN PROLACTON IS ELEVATED CERATONINTENDS TO BE ELEVATED AND WHEN PROLACTON IS ELEVATED LEVELS OF DOPOMINE AND THE EFFECTS OF DOPOMINE TEND TO SUBSIDE NOW AS I MOVE TOWARD EXPLAINING WHAT EACH OF THE FOUR CATEGORIES OF NEUMODULATORS DO THIS WILL START TO MAKE MORE OR MORE SENSE AS TO WHY THIS WOULD BE I WE SAY I WASN'T CONSULTED DESIGN PHASE MEANING I DIDN DESIGN THESE CIRCUITS AND IF ANY ONE TELLS YOU THAT THEY DID YOU SHOULD BACK AWAY QUICKLY BECAUSE NONE OF US DESIGN THE CIRCUISISIS THE WAY THAT EVOLUTION AND NATURE CREATED THESE SYSTEMS AND THEY TEND TO WORK IN A BIT OF A SEASAW FASHION PROLACTIN UP DOPAMINE DOWN RIGHT A DOPAMINE UP PROLACTIN DOWN IN GENERAL THAT IS THE WAY THEY WORK SO IF WE ARE TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW EACH OF THESE NEUROMODULATOR SYSTEMS FUNCTIONS ON ITS OWN WHILE UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY NEVER TRULY FUNCTION ON THEIR OWN WE CAN START TO REALLY MAKE SENSE OF THE LANDSCAPE OF TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO US AND WHICH TOOLS ARE GOING TO BE MOST POWERFUL TO SELECT IF OUR GOAL IS FOR INSTANCE TO BE FOCUS OR IF OUR GOAL IS TO BE LESS TRESSED OR IF OUR GOAL IS TO BE HIGHLY MOTIVATED AND HIGHLY FOCUSTD FOR SAKE OF LEARNING ALL OF THAT IS INDEED POSSIBLE IF YOU UNDERSTAND THESE FOR NEUROMODULATORS AND YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WHILE THERE ARE MANY TOOLS RANGING FROM PARMICOLLOGIC TO BEHAVIORAL THAT CAN TAP INTO THESE NORMODULATOR SYSTEMS TEM PRESS ON THE GAS OF DOPAMINE PULL BACK ON CERATONAN AND SO ON BUT THAT THERE ARE PARTICULAR TOOLS BOTH BEHAVIORAL AND SUPPLEMENTATION BASE IN TO SOME EXTENT PRESCRIPTION DRUG BASE TO AND WILL TOUCH ON A FEW OF THOSE IF YOU UNDERSTAND THAT AND WHY THEY WORK WELL THEN YOU CAN CREATE A SORT OF KIT A GRAB BAG OF THINGS THAT YOU CAN USE IN ANY CONTACTER I SHOULD SAY THAT YOU CAN LOOK TO DEPENDING ON THE CONTEXTUREIN AND CREATE THE STATES OF BODY AN MIND THAT YOU WANT NOW ONCE AGAIN PAINTING WITH A SOMEWHAT BROAD BRUSH BUT NONE THE LESS INACCURATE BRUSH WE CAN SAY THAT DOPAMINE WHEN ELEVATED ABOVE BASE LINE TENDS TO INCREASE STATES OF MOTIVATION BOTH MENTAL AND PHYSICAL MOTIVATION DRIVE AND TO SOME EXTENT FOCUS HAVE SAID IT MANY TIMES BEFORE AND I'LL SAY IT AGAIN THERE IS A LOT OF MISCONCEPTION ABOUT DOPAMINE MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE THINK THAT DOPAMINE IS ALL ABOUT PLEASURE YOU HEAREABOUT DOPAMINE HITS OR PEOPLE CHASING DOPAMINE OR THE NEED TO HAVE A DOPAMINE FAST ET CETERA DOPAMINE IS NOT ABOUT PLEASURE DOPAMINE IS ABOUT MOTIVATION CRAVING AND PURSUIT FOR GOALS OR FOR THINGS THAT ARE OUTSIDE ORE IMMEDIATE POSSESSION AND EXPERIENCE THE MOTIVATION ND PURSUIT OF A MATE THE MOTIVATION AND PURSUIT TOMATE THE MOTIVATION AND PURSUIT OF FOOD THE MOTIVATION AND PURSUIT OF A CREER GOAL ET CETERA ET CETERA THINGS WE DO NOT YET HAVE BUT THAT WE WANT AND WE GET INTO OR T OF A FORWARD CENTERE OF MASS AND A PURSUIT OF AND THAT PURSUIT CAN BE PHYSICAL THAT PURSUIT CAN BE COGNITIVE IT CAN BE BOTH COGNIVE AND PHYSICAL AND IT CAN INVOLVE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING RIGHT BECAUSE IN SOME PROFESSIONS PURSUIT OF THINGS INVOLVES TALKING I THINK ABOUT LAWYERS THEY TALK A LOT IN PURSUIT OF WINNING CASES AND MONEY ET CETERA PUTTING PEOPLE IN JAIL OR KEEPING PEOPLE OUT OF JAIL ET CETERA THAT'S DONE WITH THEIR MOUTHS NOT WITH THEIR BODIES APHLETES IN A STATE OF MOTIVATED TRAINING OR IN MOTIVATED COMPETITION USE THEIR BODIES CALL THIS IS OBVIOUS OF COURSE BUT PERHAPS WHAT IS NOT SO OBVIOUS IS THAT ONE MOLECULE NOT WORKING ALONE BUT PREDOMINANTLY ONE MOLECULE DOPOMINE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF THOSE MOTIVATED STATES WHICH AGAIN UNDERSCORES THE POWER OF THESE NERMODULATORS TO DOPIMINE WE CAN THINK OF LEASE IN THE CONTECTS OF TO DAY'S DISCUSSION AS CONTROLLING AND INDEED PROMOTING MOTIVATION DRIVE AND PURSUIT AND TO SOME EXTENT FOCUS EPINEFERAN AND A CLOSELY RELATED MOLECULE CALLED NOR EPINEFRAN AND AGAIN I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT EPINEFRAN IS A DRENALINE AND A DRENALINE IS EPINEFERAN NOR EPINEFERAN IS NORA DRENALINE AND NORA DRENLINE IS NOR EPINEFRAN BUT TODAY WE'RE GOING TO JUST SIMPLY TALK ABOUT EPINEFRAN AND NOR EPINEFERAN THAT CATEGORY OF NERMODULATOR IS MAINLY RESPONSIBLE FOR GENERATING OUR ENERGY OUR LEVEL OF FUEL AND BASE LINE LEVEL OF FORWARD CENTR OF MASS AS I LIKE TO CALL IT YOU CAN ALSO THINK OF IT IS HOW HIGHER OR P M ARE NOW WE'RE NOT AN CAR AND THE CARONALOGY SORT OF FALLS APART AS WE GO FURTHER INTO THE BIOLOGY BUT IT'S A DECENT ONE FOR NOW WHEN EPINEFRAN LEVELS ARE HIGH WE TEND TO FEEL AGITATED WE TEND TO FEEL LIKE WE WANT TO MOVE WE TEND TO FEEL LIKE WE CAN'T SHUT DOWN OUR THINKING AND ORE ANTICIPATION OF WHAT'S CAN HAPPEN NEXED AND WHEN EPINEFRAN LEVELS ARE VERY VERY LOW WE A SHE HAVE LESS PHYSICAL ENERGY WE TEND TO HAVE LESS MENTAL ENERGY IN TERMS OF GENERATING THOUGHTS VERY QUICKLY AND SO ON AND SO FORTH AND AS I MENTION BEFORE DOPIMINE AND EPINEFRAN ARE CLOSELY RELATED SO MUCH SO THAT WE KNOW FOR A FACT THAT EPINEFRN IS ACTUALLY MANUFACTURED FROM THE MOLECULE TOPOMINE SO THAT'S WHY AM TALKING ABOUT THESE TWO NERMODULATORS AND VERY CLOSE TRUCKS TO POSITION BECAUSE THEY DO INDEED COLLABORATE WITH ONE ANOTHER BUT FORSAKE OF TO DAY'S DISCUSSION WE CAN JUST THINK OF EPINEFERANES INCREASING ENERGY A DRENALINE INCREASES ENERGY IN OUR STATE OF READINESS IT ALSO I SHOULD MENTION ACTIVATES OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF THAT STRESS IN HIBITS ARMIUN SYSTEM EPINEFRAN IS DEPLOYED ITS RELEASED AT GREAT LEVELS IN OUR BRAIN AND BODY WHEN WE ARE STRESSED AND THAT ACTUALLY PROTECTS US AGAINST INFECTIONS OF MULTIBLE KINDS AT LEAST IN TE SHORT TERM THAT AND ALL THE DETAILS OF THAT AND TOOLS RELATED TO THAT WE'RE COVERED IN OUR EPISOD ON THE IMMUNE SYSTEM IF YOU WANT A CHECK THAT OUT NOW THE NURMODULATOR CERATONAN CREATES A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT STATES IN THE BRAIN AND BODY BUT FORSAKE OF TO DAY'S DISCUSSION WE'RE GOING TO THINK ABOUT THE PREDOMINANT STATES THAT IT CREATES AND THOSE ARE STATES OF CONTENTNESS BEING HAPPY FEELING FAIRLY RELAXED FEELING SOOTHED END TOSOME EXTEND EVEN SOME RELIEF FROM PAIN OR LACK OF PAIN CERTONAN IS ASSOCIATE WITH HA FEELING OF SETIETY OF HAVING ENOUGH OF WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE NOW WHEN CERTONAN IS VERY VERY HIGH PEOPLE CAN EVEN BE SEDATE THEY CAN BE COMPLETELY AMOTIVATED NO MOTIVATION TO SEEK OUT THINGS LIKE FOOD OR SECS OR WORK ET CETERA WHEREAS WHEN CERTONAN LEVELS ARE VERY LOW PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY EXHIBIT AGITATION AND HIGH LEVELS OF STRESS SO THE LEVELS MATTER HERE BUT AGAIN FOR SAKE OF TO DAY'S CONVERSATION WHEN WE LEVERAGE CERATONAN WHERE ARE REALLY LEVERAGING AND NEUROMODULATOR THAT TENDS TO INCREASE THE ACTIVITY OF NERAL CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT MAKE US FEEL RELAXED AND HAPPY AND IT TENDS TO DECREASE THE ACTIVITY OF NEURL CIRCUITS THAT MAKE US RABIDLY IN PURSUIT OF THINGS THAT WE DON'T HAVE RIGHT THE OPPOSITE OF CONTENT AND SATED IS MOTIVATION DESIRE AND HUNGER AND THIRST FOR THINGS THAT WE DON'T HAVE SO CERATONAN IS THE MOLECULE OF PEACE IT IS THE MOLECULE OF CONTENTNESS IT IS THE MOLECULE OF HAVING ENOUGH AT LEAST FOR THE TIME BEING OR THE FEELING THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH FOR THE TIME BEING NOW ACEDOCOLING IS A FOURTH CATEGORY OF NEURUMODULATOR THAT AS I MENTION EARLIER IS SOMEWHAT NOT TOLALLY BUT SOMEWHAT DISTINCT FROM ANY DIRECT CONTROL BY THE MAJOR HORMON SYSTEMS OF THE BODY OR T LEAST THE MAJOR STEROID OR MONE SYSTEMS AN ACEDOCLING WE CAN SAY IS MAINLY A SOCIATED WITH STATES OF FOCUS AND WE CAN GO A STEP FURTHER AND SAY THAT ITS MAINLY ASSOCIATED WITH STEPS OF FOCUS AS THEY RELATE TO LEARNING AND ENCODING NEW INFORMATION SO CALLED NEURO PLASTICITY NOW NEURO PLASTICITY OR THE BRAINAN NERVOUS SYSTEMSIBILITY TO CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO EXPERIENCE CAN BE IMPACTED BY AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CHEMICALS NOT JUST A SEDO COLING BUT ASEDO CLING HAS A PARTICULARLY POTENT ABILITY TO OPEN UP THE THING THAT WE CALL NERL PLASTICITY TO ALLOW PLASTICITY TO HAPPEN IN ONE MOMENT WHEREAS IN A PREVIOUS MOMENT IT COULD NOT OCCUR BECAUSE THE SEDO COLING HAD NOT BEEN RELEASED IN THE BRAIN OR IN THE SPINAL COURT SO ASEDOCOLING IS AVOLVED IN FOCUS AND IN LEARNING BUT IT IS NOT NECESSARILY ALWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH LEARNING IN THE CONTEXT OF HIGHLY MOTIVATED REALLY RAMPED UP STATES IT CAN BE BUT A CEDOCOLING CAN ALSO BE RELEASED AND CAN ENCOURAGE THE LEARNING AND NERL PLASTICITY ASSOCIATED WITH CALM STATES FOR INSTANCE IF SOMEBODY HAS A NEW BORN CHILD WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE FLOODED WITH OXYTOSEN WHICH HAS ACTUALLY EVEN BEEN CALLED THE LOVE HORMONER THO IT DOES MANY THINGS IN ADDITION TO CONTROL FEELINGS OF ROMANTIC ATTACHMENT AND ATTACHMENT TO CHILDREN ET CETERA DOES ALL OF THAT BUT IT DOES A LOT MORE AS WELL BUT WHEN PEOPLE HAVE A NEW CHILD THEY ALSO TEND TO BE HYP RE FOCUSED ON THAT CHILD NOT JUST ITS WELL BEING BUT THEY NARROW ALL THEIR THINKING ALL THEIR VISION ALL THEIR HEARING TO THAT CHILD AND THEIR OBVIOUS ADAPT OF REASONS FOR WANTING TO DO THAT I RECALL A FAMILY DINNER WE HAD GOSHTHIS WAS OVER TEN YEARS AGO WE HAD A COUPLE OVER THEY WERE Y MOMENT WAS IN THE HABIT OF INVITING PEOPLE OVER WHO DIDNT HAVE PLACES TO GO ON THE HOLIDAYS POSSESS JUST WHO SHE IS AN I THINS QUITE NICE HE BROUGHT OVER THIS COUPLE THEY HAD A NEW BORN THINTHIS BABYHAD BEEN MORN MAY BE TWO OR THREE WEEKS BEFORE AND IT WAS SEEDED ARE NOT SEEDED IT WAS LYING DOWN IT COULDN'T SEE THIS LIKE A POTATO BUGU BARELY HOLDS HEAD UP BUT IT WAS LYING IN A LITTLE BASSINETT ON THE FLOOR AS WE ATE DINNER AND IT WAS ALMOST HOLERE IT ACTALLY WAS HILARIS WE LAUGHED ALOUT ABOUT THIS THAT THE ENTIRE MEAL THEY WERE BASICALLY STARING AT THIS BABY THEY WERE SO CLEARLY IN LOVE WITH THE BABY AND SO FLOODED WITH OXY TOSIN AND ALSO PROLACTAN THAT THEY COULDN'T TAKE THEIR FOCUS OFF THIS BABY IT WAS AS SHA REALLY WONDERFUL AND ENDEARING TO SEE BUT IN ADDITION TO THABT I'D BE WILLING TO BET HAD I BEEN ABLE TO DO A LA BIT OF MICRODIALYSIS WHICH IS A ABILITY TO MEASURE THE AMOUNTS OF A NOR NORMAGELATOR TO GIVIN LOCATION THE BRAIN HAD I BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT EXPERIMENT ON THEM IN THAT MOMENT I WOULD HAVE FOUND THAT LEVELS OF A SEATO COLLING WERE EXCEEDINGLY HIGH BECAUSE THEY WERE SO HYPER FOCUS ON THIS CHILD NOT JUST IN LOVE WITH BUT FOCUS ON THAT CHILD AND WITHOUT A DOUBT THE NERL CIRCUITS RELATED TO FOCUS AND PLASTICITY WERE HEAVILY ENGAGED AGAIN FOR OBVIOUS ADAPTOV REASONS RELATED TO CHILD REARING IN LEARNING THE COOSIN CRIES AND PAIN SIGNALS AND PLEASURE SIGNALS OF ONE'S OFFSPRING SO WE HAVE DOPOMIN ASSOCIATE WITH MOTIVATION DRIVE AND PURSUIT AND TO SOME EXTENT FOCUS WE HAVE EPINEFERAN AND NORPONEFERAN ASSOCIATE WITH ENERGY OF HAVING A FORWARD CENTER OF MASS MENTALLY AND OR PHYSICALLY WE HAVE SERATONAN WHICH IS ASSOCIATED WITH THEY PEACEFUL CONTENT SADED STATE OF BEING AND WE HAVE A SEETA CULLING WHICH IS ASSOCIATE WITH FOCUS AND IN PARTICULAR FOCUS AS IT RELATES TO LEARNING AND ENCODING NEW INFORMATION SO LIT' SA YOU WANT TO BE MORE MOTIVATED YOU WANT TO BE MORE IN PURSUIT OF GOALS AND YOU WANT TO HAVE MORE ENERGY AND TO BE MORE FOCUSD THEY'RE MANY WAYS TO GO ABOUT THAT IN FACT THERE'S A NEAR INFINITE CLOUD OF OPPORTUNITIES EVERYTHING FROM PRESCRIPTION DRUGS TO ELICIT DRUGS WHICH I CERTAINLY DO NOT RECOMMEND SUPPLEMENTS NUTRRICIAN YOUN LISTEN TO PARTICULAR MUSIC YOU CAN DO ALL SORTS OF COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTATION TRICKS OR YOU CAN JUST UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT YOU'RE REALLY AFTER ARE INCREASES IN DOPOMIN ABOVE BASE LINE THAT YOU CONTROL AND THERE AREWAYS TO CONTROL THEM THAT ARE QUITE POTENT AND SCIENCE TELLS US WHICH TOOLS ARE GOING TO BE THE MOST POTENT AND THE MOST VERSATILE FOR YOU SO'ME GAN A SHARE THOSE TOOLS WITH YOU NOW WHITH THE CAVIAT THAT EACH ONE OF TH OSE TOOLS COULD BE ITS OWN ENTIRE PODCAST EPISODE AD THAT WE'VE DONE IT NEAR ENTIRE EPISODES ON EACH OF THESE TOOLS ARE SMALL COLLECTIONS OF THESE TOOLS SOME CAN TO COVER THESE AND SOMWHAT SUPERFICIAL MANNER WE CAN PROVIDE LINKS TO PREVIOUS EPISODES THAT RELATE TO EACH OF THESE TOOLS IN DETAIL BUT I'LL GIVE YOU ENOUGH DETAIL ABOUT THEM THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU TO INCORPORATE THEM INTO YOUR ROUTINE SHOULD YOU CHOOSE LET SAY YOU ONT INCREASE DOPAMINE FORSAKE OF INCREASING MOTIVATION THE FIRST THING TO DO IS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE NATURAL BEHAVIOURAL TOOLS OFF FOR INCREASING DOPAMINE AND TO DO THOSE AS CONSISTENTLY AS POSSIBLE AGAIND THESE ARE TOOLS THAT YOU'LL WANT TO DO NEARLY EVERY DAY IF NOT EVERY DAY AND I KNOW I'M SOUNDING LIKE A BROKEN RECORD ON THES ONE BUT HERE AGAIN WE COME TO SUNLIGHT AND I SHOULD SAY NOT JUST THE DESIRE TOO BUT REALLY THE NEED FOR VIEWING THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF SUNLIGHT THAT ONE CAN REASONABLY GET GIVEN SCHEDULS AND LOCATIONS IN THE WORLD TIME OF YOUR ET CETERA IN THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY WITHIN THE FIRST HOUR OF WAKING IDEALLY BUT CERTAINLY IN THE FIRST THREE HOURS OF YOUR DAY YOU GOING TO WANT TO MAXIMIZE SUNLIGHT EXPOSURE TO YOUR EYES NEVER LOOK AT THE SUN OR ANY OTHER LIGHT SO BRIGHT THAT IT'S PAINFUL TO LOOK AT AN YESS OF COURSE BLINKING IS FINED BUT KNOW TAKE SUNGLASSES OFF GO OUTSIDE ONCE THE SUN IS OUT AND GET SOME NATURAL LIGHT IN YOUR EYES AND IF IT'S APPROPRIATE OR I SHOULD SAY IN AY WAY THAT'S APPROPRIATE NAXIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF SUNLIGHT EXPOSURE TO YOUR SKIN BUT PLEASE DON'T GET BURNED PLEASE DO WHERE SUN SCREEN IF YOUR PRONE TO GETTING BURNED TYPICALLY EARLY DAY SUNLIGHT IS NOT GOING TO BURN YOU AT LEAST NOT MOST PEOPLE UNLESS YOUR EXTREMELY FAIR SKIND SO DON'T GET BURN DO WHAT YOU NEED TO IN ORDER TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM BURNED THERE'S SOME EMERGING CONTROVERSY ABOUT SUNSCREEN AND WHICH ONES ARE SAFE IN WHICH ONES AREN'T SAFE WE HAVE NOT DONE AN EPISODE ON THAT YET BUT I FIND IT TO BE AN IMPORTANT AND INTERESTING TOPIC DARYAROSE DOCTOR DIRY AROSE I SHOULD SAY HAS A PODCASKALL THE DARIA ROSE PODCAST AND DID AN EPISODE ALL ABOUT SUNSCREENS WHICH ARE SAFE WHICH ARE NOT SAFE BY INTERVIEWING AN EXPERT ON THAT SO I REFOR YOU TO THAT PODCASCESS OR RELATES TO SUNSCREEN BUT GETS SEM NATURAL LIGHT EXPOSURE IN YOUR EYES AND IF YOU WAKE UP BEFORE THE SUN COMES OUT TURN ON AS MANY BRIGHT LIGHTS INSIDE AS YOU C TURN ON REASONABLY GIVEN YOUR ELECTRIC BILL ET CETERA GET A LOT OF BRIGHT SUNLIGHT EXPOSURE EARLY IN THE DAY AND GET A LOT OF SUNLIGHT EXPOSURE TO YOUR SKIN IN THE EARLY PART OF THE THEY IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T BURN YOU MEANING BURN YOUR SKIN OR BLIND YOU PLEASE PLEASE DON'T ANYTHING THAT HARMS YOUR VISION LIKE STAREID INTO BRIGHT LIGHT THAT'S PAINFUL WHAT IS THAT DO WELL IT SETS IN MOTION A NUMBER OF DIFFEN BIOLOGICAL CASCADE SUMMARE VERY FAST THERE ARE FAST ACTIONS OF SUNLIGHT THAT WILL TRIGGER FOR INSTANCE DOPAMINE RELEASE FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF YOUR BRAIN AND YOUR INTICRANT SYSTEM AND WE NOW KNOW THAT IT INCREASES LEVELS OF GEANES RELATED TO THIROD HORMONE AND ACTURALLY INCREASES CERTAIN DOPAMINE RECEPTERS THEREIS A WONDERFUL PAPER WE WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO THIS PAPER THAT SHOWS THAT SUNLIGHT EXPOSURE CAN ACT ALLY INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF SO CALLED D R D FOUR THIS IS A PARTICULAR TYPE OF DOPAMING RECEPTOR THAT DOPING RECEPTOR FOR THE GENES FOR DOPAMING RECEPTOR FOR ARE ACTUALLY UNDER PHOTIC CONTROL SO IF YOU GET SUNLIGHT EXPOSURE TO YOUR EYES AND IT DOES HAFE TO BE TO YOUR EYES IN THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY YOU INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF DOPAMING RECEPTOR THAT YOU HAVE WHICH ALLOWS WHATEVER CIRCULATING DOPAMINE HAPPENS TO BE THERE TO HAVE A GREATER EFFECT ON MOTIVATION AND I SHOULD SAY ALSO ON MOOD AND FEELINGS OF BEING IN PURSUIT AND GENERALLY IN CRAVING AND PURSUIT OF THINGS IN LIFE NOW THERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO INCREASE THE EFFECT OF WHATEVER DOPAMIN HAPPENS TO BE CIRCULATING IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY AND THIS AGAIN RELATES TO INCREASING THE NUMBER OR THE EFFICACY OF THE RECEPTORS FOR DOPAMINE NOW HERE WERE NOT TALK AM OUT THE DOPAMING RECEPTOR FOR BUT A DIFFERENT KATEGORY DOPAMING RECEPTORS THE D TWO AND D THREE RECEPTORS WHICH ARE EXPRESSED MULTRIL PLACES IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY AND BIND DOPAMI MEANING DOPAMINE PARKS IN THEM LIKE A PARKING SPOT AND ALLOWS DOPAMINE TO GENERALLY INCREASE THE ACTIVITY OF THE NURONS AND CELLS THAT EXPRESS THOSE DOPAMING RECEPTORS HOW DO YOU DO THAT WELL TURNS OUT THAT REGULAR INGESTION OF KAFFINE AT SAFE AND APPROPRIATE LEVELS ABOUT A HUNDRED TO TWO UNDRER FIFTY MILIGRAMS IS GOING TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF D TWO IND THREE DOPAMING RECEPTORS I TALK TO LOBIT ABOUT THIS ON A PREVIOUS EPISODE GAND WILL PROVIDE LINXS TO THE STUDIES BUT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FINDING I BELIEVE BECAUSE THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE ACUTE THE IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF KAFFINE ON ALERTNESS ALTHOUGH THOSE OCCUR TO WHEN YOU DRINK KAFFINE IT'S GOING TO INCREASE YOUR LEVELS OF A DRENALINE AND SO CALLED EPINEFRAN WHICH WILL INCREASE YOUR ENERGY LEVELS IT'S GOING TO DECREASE LEVELS OF SOMETHING ALL THE DENIZINE WHICH BUILDS UP WHILE YOUR SLEEPY IT'S GOING TO MAKE YOU FEEL LESS SLEEPY MORE ALERT MORE ENERGETIC THAT SORT OF OBVIOUS BUT WHAT'S LESS OBVIOUS IS THAT IT'S INCREASING THE NUMBER AND EFFICACY OF DOPAMING RECEPTORS SO THAT WHATEVER DOPAMINE HAPPENS TO BE AROUND IN YOUR SYSTEM IS GOING TO HAVE MORE OF A POTENT EFFECT SO HOW MUCH KAFFINE SHOULD YOU DRINK THAT'SCON A VERY FROM PERSON AF PERSON SOME PEOPLE ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO KAFFINE OTHERS ARE NOT I TEND TO BE FAIRLY INSENSITIVE TO KAFFINE CAUSE I'VE BEEN DRINKING IT FOR HONG PERIOD OF TIME BUT YOU KNOW AFTER ONE OR TWO CUPS OF ASPRESSO OR COFFEE I FEEL LIKE I'VE HAD ENOUGH I TEND TO DRINK MY KAFFINE EARLY IN THE DAY WHICH IS WHAT I'M GOING TO RECOMMEND THAT YOU DO NOT DRINKING KAFFINE PASS TWO IN CERTAINLY NOT FOUR P M IF YOU'RE ON A TYPICAL SKETCH ON YOU WONE TO BE ABLE TO SLEEP THAT NIGHT EVEN IF YOU CAN FALL ASLEEP HAVING TOO MUCH KAFFINE IN YOUR SYSTEM IS NOT GOOD BECAUSE IT DESTRUPTS THE ARCHITECTURE OF SLEEP AND NOW KNOWING ABOUT ALL THE METABOLIC VARIABILITY ACROSS THE NIGHT ACCORDING TO DIFFERENT STAGES OF SLEEP IT SHOULD BE EVEN MORE OBVIOUS AS TO WHY DESTRUPTING THE ARCHITECTURE OF SLEEP WILL BE BAD FOR YOU SO LIMIT THAT KAFFINE AND TAKE TO EARLY IN THE DAY AND DON'T GOPALISTIC IF YOU'RE NOT CERTINLY NONCABLISTIC IN ANY CASE BUT FOR MOST PEOPLE ANYWHERE FROM ONE HUNDRED OF FOUR HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF KAFFINE I'S GOING TO HAVE THIS EFFECT AND THIS EFFECT AGAIN IS A SLOW ACCUMULATING EFFECT BY DRINKING KAFFING CONSISTENTLY DAY TO DAY I GET MY KAFFINE MAINLY FROM EURBAMATE T I W ONE EMPHASIZED THAS POBLY GOOD IDEAS STAY AWAY FROM THE SMOKED MATES THERE SOME EVIDENCE THOSE CAN BE CARSIN AGENIC BUT I BREWMY OWN ERBOMATE TE OR SOMETIMES I'LL DRINK COFFEE OR SPRESSOVER SOMETIMES BOTH FRANKLY AS ALLS I'M HYDRATING ENOFGTEN AM GETTING A SALT THAN I TEND TO FEEL FOND WITHOUT MUCH CAFINE THE OTHER WAY TO INCREASE DOPAMINE AND TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR BASELINE LEVELS OF DOPAMINE ARE HIGH ENOUGH IS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR EATING SUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF TYRACINE RICH FOODS YOU CAN LOOK UP WHICH FOODS INCLOD TYRACINE TYRAINES A PRECURSOR TO DOAMINE ITS IN AMINOACID THAT IS IDIRECT PATHWAY TO DOPAMINE SYNTHESIS AN TYRACINE FOODS INCLUDE THINGS LIKE CERTAIN MEATS PARMEGON CHEESE VERY HIGH IN TYRAINE FOR INSTANCE IN FACT THERE SMETHING CALLED THE CHEESE EFFECT BELIEVE IT ORE NOT I DO'TWANT TO GO TOO FAR OFF TOPIC BUT THE CHEESE EFFECT IS KIND OF INTERESTING BECAUSE CERTAIN PEOPLE WILL TAKE ANTI DEPRESSENCE THAT ARE SO CALLED M A O INHIBITERS MONOAMINE OXIDATE IN HIBITERS ANY TIME YOU HEAR A S THAT'S AN ENZIME THEY WILL TAKE THESE IN HIBITERS THAT PREVENT THE BREAK DOWN OF DOPAMINE AND OTHER SO CAL CATACOLAMINES WHICH ALLOW MORE DOPAMINE TO BE INCIRCULATION BUT IF THESE PEOPLE EAT CERTAIN CHEESES INCLUDING PARMCSON CHEESE AND THERE ARE OTHER FOODS OF COURSE THAT INCLUDE NOCUS TYRACINE BUT ONE OF THESE DERIVITIVES OF TYRAINE CALLED IT TERAMINE THAT GENERATES WHAT'SCALLED THE CHEESE OFFACT WHICH IS PEOPLE GET POTENT MY GRAINES HEADACHES BLOOD PRESSURE GOES UP WHY WELL BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF TYRACINE IN THEIR SYSTEM AND DOPAMINE IN THEIR SYSTEM AND THEY'VE GOT LESS OF THE ENZINE THAT REMOVES THAT DOPAMNE OR LIMITS ITS ACTION AND SO THEY HAVE AN EXCESS OF DOPAMINE AND DOPAMINE HAS EFFECTS ON BLOOD PRESSURE ET CETERA SO THE CHEESE EFFECT OF SOMETHING TO AVOID IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO'S TAKING DRUGS THAT TAPIN TO OR MANIPULATE THE DOPAMINE PATHWAY OITHER FOR PARKINSONS OR DEPRESSIONS OVUSEEOUR GOING TO ON TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT ADJUSTING UP OR DOWN LEVELS OF DOPAMINE TO POTENTLY SO MIND THE CHEESE EFFECT IF YOUR TAKING IN MAY O INHIBITER SLOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THIS ON LINE FOR MOST PEOPLE EATING FOODS LIKE PARMEGON CHEESE EATING FOODS LIKE A CERTAIN MEATS AND CERTAIN VEGETABLES ALSO CAN INCREASE TRACINE LEVELS WHICH WILL INCREASE DOPAMINE SYNTHESIS SO THESE ARE WAYS OF MODULATING MORE LESS THE BASE LINE OF DOPAMINE THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO PRODUCE IN THE WAYS THAT DOPAMINE CAN HAVE ITS ACTION BY WAY OF BINDING TO RECEPTORS MORE POTENTLY NOW THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO INCREASE DOPAMINE IN A MORE ACUTE OR DIRECTED WAY WAYS TO SPIKE YOUR DOPAMINE TO ENHANCE YOUR STATE OF MOTIVATION MOOD FOCUS AND SO ON AND IN THINKING ABOUT THE VAST LANDSCAPE OF TOOLS THAT CAN DO THAT WE HAVE ONE CATEGORY OF TOOLS WHICH ARE THE REALLY REALLY BAD THINGS THAT I DON'T RECOMMEND ANYBODY DO IN FACT I RECOMMEND NOBODY DO EVER WHICH ARE THINGS LIKE COCANE METHEMPTAMINE ET CETERA THEY ARE INCREDIBLY DESTRUCTIVE FOR LIVES BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THEY SOPOTENLI INCREASE DOPAMINE AND THAN THE CRASHION DOPAMINE THAT OCCURS LATER AM IN THEY CAN INDEED AN OFTEN DO RUIN LIVES SO RE LEA ING THOSE OFF THE TABLE THERE ARE OF COURSE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT MANY PEOPLE IN ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE CLINICALLY DIAGNOSE EIGHTY EHTY ATTENTION DEPISIT IPERACTIVITY DISORDER RELY ON AND IN FACT BENEFIT FROM IN MANY CASES THINGS LIKE RIDLIN ATER ALL VIVANTS NOWADAYS THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF INTEREST IN USE OF THINGS LIKE MODAPHANEL ARMODAPHANEL I COVERED ALL OF THOSE IN THE EPI SODE ON EIGHTY EIGHT AND YOU CAN FIND THAT HUBRMAN LABDOK COM IN THE OTHER PLACES THIS PODCASSER IS FOUND PRESCRIPTION DRGS ASIDE BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE A PRESCRIPTION AND A DISCUSSION THAT IN DEPTH AN APPROPRIATE WITH YOUR PHYSICIAN HELTCR PROVIDER THERE ARE SUPPLEMENTS THAT CAN VERY POTENTLY INCREASED DOPOMINE AS WELL PERHAPS NOT TO THE EXTENT THAT SOME OF THOSE OTHER PRESCRIPTION DRUGS CAN BUT CERTAINLY TO A DEGREE THAT WILL IMPACT AND INCREASE DOPOMINE AND MOTIVATION AND THE THER STATES DOPOMINUS ASSOCIATE WITH AND THE TWO MAIN CATEGORIES OF SUPPLEMENTS THAT ARE VERY EFFECTIVE IN RAISING DOPOMINE AND HERE I SHOULD PROVIDE THE COVIOT THAT ANY TIME YOU'RE GOING TO ADD OR REMOVE ANYTHING FROM MERE SUPPLEMENTATION PROTOCALLS PLEASE TALCTOPHYSICIAN WHO IS KNOWLEDGIBLE ON THESE TOPICS YOUR SOMEBODY WHO HAS OR IS TAKING DRUGS FOR DEPRESSION NORMANIA PLEASE BE VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT MANIPULATING YOUR DOPOMINE IN ANY CASE I DON'T YUST SAY THAT TO PROTECT US I SAY THAT TO PROTECT YOU BUT IF WE TO LOOK AT THE SUPPLEMENT LANDSCAPE AND ASK WHICH SUPPLEMENTS INCREASE DOPOMINE THERE ARE A VAST NUMBER OF THEM BUT THE THREE MAIN ONES THE MOST EFFECTIVE ONES THAT ARE READILY AVAILABLE OUT THERE WITHOUT A PRESCRIPTION ARE MACUNAPURINES THIS IS ACTUALLY THE OUTSIDE OF A VELVETY BEING THAT HAS BEEN EXTRACTED AND PUT INTO A SUPPLEMENT MACUNAPURINES IS ACTUAL EL DOPA IT'S NINETY NINE PERCENT EL DOPA WHICH IS A PRESCRIPTION DRUG THAT IS GIVEN FOR PARKENSINS AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES WHERE INCREASING DOPOMINE IS IMPORTANT I DON'T RECOMMEND MACUNO PURINES I'M NOT SAYING THAT NO ONE SHOULD TAKE IT BUT I DON'T TAKE IT AND I DON'T RECOMMEND IT BECAUSE IT TENDS TO SO POTENTLY AND ACUTELY INCREASE DOPOMINE THAT THEREIS A PRESUBSTANTIAL CRASH AFTERWARDS SO I AVOID IT AND I DON'T GENERALLY SUGGEST THAT ANY ONE TAKE IT UNLESS THERE IS REALLY A CLINICAL NEED OR THEY'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH SOMEBODY THAT CAN REALLY MONITER THAT THE OTHER TWO SUPPLEMENTS THAT CAN INCREASED DOPOMINE IN A SHORT TERM WAY BUT IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY AR EL TYROSCINES YOU CAN BUY THAT AS A SUPPLEMENT MENOACID I SOMETIMES TAKE THIS I WOULD SAY I PROBABLY TAKE IT ABOUT ONCE A WEEK MAXIMUM FOR WORKBOUTS OR WORK OUTS I'LL TAKE IT IN DOSAGES OF ANYWHERE FROM FIVE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS TO A THOUSAND MILIGRAMS PEOPLE VERY TREMENDOUSLY IN THEIR SENSITIVITY TO SUPPLEMENTING ELTYRASINE I KNOW PEOPLE THAT CAN TAKE TWO GRAMS I KNOW PEOPLE THAT CAN BARELY TAKE A HUNDRED MILIGRAMS AN NO PEOPLE THAT THE BESTDOSE FOR THEM IS ZEROMELIGRAM SO THERE'S A LOT OF VARIATION THEIRE DEPENDING ON SENSITIVITY AND THEIR NATURAL BASELINE LEVELS OF DOPOMINE AND WHETHER NOT THER DOING A LOT OF OTHER THINGS TO SUPPORT DOPOMIE BUT NONE THE LESS TAKING ELTIRASENE WILL LEAD TO FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN DOPAMING WITHIN ABOUT FIFTEEN TO FORTY FIVE MINUTES AND T LAST FOR ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES TO TWO HOURS AND THEN THE'S KIND OF A TAPE PORRING OFF SOME PEOPLE EXPERIENCE A LITTLE BIT OF AN EMOTIONAL OR ANDOR I SHOULD SAY ENERGETIC CRASH SOME PEOPLE DON'T THAN THE OTHER SUPPLEMENT THAT I CERTAINLY USE AND THAT I NOW NUMBER OF OTHER PEOPLE USES MORE FAST ACTING BUT MORE POTENT WHICH IS FENAL ETHLAMINE THIS RELATES TO THE SO CALLED P E A MOLECULE P P E A AND FENAL ETHELAMINE INCREASES DOPOMINE AND SOME ATABOLITES RELATED TO DOPAMING IN WAYS THAT REALLY INCREASE ENERGY AND FEELINGS O WELL BEING IN MOTIVATION AND AGAIN ITS FAST ACTING SOME MY PARTICULAR PROTO CALL THE ONE I USE IS I'LL TAKE FENAL ETHELAMINE AT DOSES OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TO SIX HUNDRED MELEGRAMS ALONG WITH SOME ELTYROCINE OR I'LL TAKE IT ON ITS OWN WITH ACULE OR I SHOULD SAY COMPOUND THAT WILL TALK ABOUT A LIB IT LATER AS IT RELATES TO A SEATO COLLING ALPHAG P C BUT TYROCINE AND PINAL ETHLAMING TAKEN ALONE OR TOGETHER WILL MAKE YOU FEEL MORE MOTIVATED AND MORE ALERT MORE WILLING AND ABLE TO LEAN INTO PARTICULAR MOTE OF ATO BEHAVIORS WHETHER NOT THEIR PHYSICAL OR COGNITIVE IF YOU LIKE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THESE COMPOUNDS AND THEIR SUPPLEMENTATION AND THEIR EFFECTS INCURGE YOU TO CHECK OUT THE EVER VALUABLE WEBSITE EXAMINE OT CAM ITS ZERO COST TO ACCESS HAND THEY PROVIDE REFERENCES AND SOME MORE DETAILS ABOUT THESE SORTS OF COMPOUNDS AND OTHER RELATED COMPOUNDS NOW IF WE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT BEHAVIORAL TOOLS FOR POTENTLY INCREASING DOPOMINE THAT TOO IS A VAST LANDSCAPE ND WE KNOW BASED ON HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF STUDIES THAT THINGS LIKE WINNING AT SOME SORT OF COMPETITION OR SUCCEEDING IN REACHING A GOAL CAN CERTAINLY INCREASE DOPAMING WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THIS IN THE EPISODE ON DOPAMINE MOTIVATION AND DRIVE BUT LEAVING THAT ASIDE THERE ARE CERTAIN BEHAVIORAL PROTOCALS THAT ARE UNRELATED TO YOUR OVER ALL GOALS AND MOTIVATIONS THAT CAN INCREASED DOPOMING IN A VERY SUSTAINED WAY AND WITHOUT QUESTION THE MOST POTENT BEHAVIORAL TOOL FOR DOING THAT IS GOING TO BE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE A DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT A LOT HERE AND ELSEWHERE IN TERMS OF ITS ABILITY TO DO THINGS LIKE RODUCE INFLEMATION AS A WAY TO TEST AND IMPROVE RAZILIENTS BECAUSE UNCOMFORTABLE COLD A PROVIDED ITS APPLIED SAFELY IS A GREAT WAY TO LEARN TO BE MORE RAZILIENT BECAUSE YOU'R ESSENTIALLY STAYING OR FORCING YOURSELF TO STAY IN A CIRCUMSTANCE WERE YOUR SYSTEM IS FLOODED WITH A DRENALINE BUT ONE LESSER KNOWN ASPECT OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE IS ONE THAT'S BEEN DEMONSTRATED QUITE CONVINCINGLY IN HUMANS COMES FROM A STUDY PUBLISHIN THE OUR TWO THOUSAND A LINK TO THE STUDY I LOVE THIS STUDY BY THE WAY COVERED IT MANY TIMES ON THIS POD CAST BECAUSE THEY LOVE IT SO MUCH AND I THINK ITS TRULY IMPORTANT AND THAT'S THE STUDY FROM PSTROMIC AT ALL ENTITLED HUMAN PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES TO IMMERSION INTO WATER OF DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES IM NOT CON TO GOING TO THIS INTO A TON OF DETAIL FOR SAKE OF TIME BUT BASI ALY WHAT THEY SHOW IS THAT PUTTING PEOPLE INTO COLD WATER AND I SHALL MENTION THAT WATER THAT THEY USE IN THES STUDY WASN'T THAT COLD THEY HARE TO UCH O IFFERENT CONDITIONS BUT THEY HAD PEOPLE THAT GOT INTO FOR INSTANCE SIXTY DEGREE FARENHEITE WATER FOR UP TO TWO HOURS AND THEM SITTING THERE A MELL LON SHARE UP TO THEIR NECK HAD VERY LONG SUSTAINED INCREASES IN DOPAMIN TRANSMISSION AND DOPAMIN CIRCULATION IN THEIR BRAIN AND BODY IN ALSO SOME OF THE OTHER CATACOLAMINES S A MENTION BEFOR DOPAMIN TENTS TO COLLABORATE WITH EPINFRON AND VICE VERSA NOW YOU DON'T NEED TO PUT YOURSELF INTO SIXTY DEGREE FARENHEITE WATER TO GET THESE KIND OF SUSTAINED INCREASES AND YOU CERTAINLY DON'T NEED TO DO IT FOR TWO HOURS WE HAVE STRONG REASON TO BELIEVE BASED ON SUBSEQUENT STUDIES IN FACT PUBLISHES THIS LAST YEAR THAT GETTING INTO MUCH COLDER WATER OF SAY FIFTY DEGREES OR FIFTY FIVE DEGREES OR EVEN FORTY FIVE DEGREES FERENHEIT CAN POTENTLY INCREASE DOPAMINE AND EPINEFERON AS WELL AND TAT YOU DON'T NEED TO EXPOSE YOURSELF TO THAT COLD WATER FOR NEARLY AS LONG SO PERHAPS EVEN AS SHORT AS ONE MINUTE OR EVEN THIRTY SECONDS EXPOSURE TO REALLY COLD WATER CAN LEAD TO THESE POTENT LONGLASTING INCREASES IN DOPAMINE MANY PEOPLE WILL ASK WHICH PROTOCALS TO FOLLOW FOR INSTANCE WILL A COLD SHOWER SUFFICE VERY LIKELY YES IF YOUR SHOWER GETS COLD ENOUGH DO YOU NEED ICE FLOATING IN THE BATH NO IT'S ALL ABOUT THE TEMPERATURE NOT WHETHER NOTHERS ICE PRESENT OR NOT HOW LONG TO STAY IN THERE THERE ARE A LOT OF DETAILS THAT WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO INTO THIS EPISODE PLEA SEE THE EPISODE ON THE USE OF DELIBERATE COLD FOR HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE YOU'LL FIND THAT HUBERMAN LABDOT COM WE HAVE A NEWS LETTER RELATED TO THIS IT GETS INTO A LOT OF DETAILED PROTOCOLS BUT IN GENERAL WE CAN SAY THAT THE WAY TO EVOKE DOPAMINE AND EPON EPERAN RELEASE USIN COLD WATER IS TO IDEALLY YOU WOULD DO COLD WATER IMMERSION IF YOU CAN'T YOU USE COLD SHOWER BUT YOU WANT TO USE A TEMPERATURE THAT IS SAFE MEANING YOU'RE NOT CAN HAVE A HARD ATTACK BUT THAT IS UNCOMFORTABLE SUCH THAT YOU REALLY WANT TO GET OUT AND THEN STAYING IN FOR ANYWHERE FROM ONE MINUTE TO TEN MINUTES DEPENDING ON HOW COLD ADAPTED YOU ARE AND THEN GETTING OUT AND DRYING OFF AND GOING ABOUT YOUR DAY UNLESS YOU HAVE SOME OTHER PROTOCOL THT YOURE TRYING TO EXTRACT FROM THE COLD SO THIS IS A COLD EXPOSURE PROTOCAL SPECIFICALLY AIMED AT INCREASING DOPAMINE FOR SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE YOU MIGHT THINK THIS KIND OF SILLY USING COLD WATER INCREASE DOPAMINE BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DATE O INHUMANS ON THE EFFECT OF COLD WATER EXPOSURE TO STIMULATE LONG LASTING VERY SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN DOPAMINE AND EPINEFRON I THINK YOU W'LL AGREE THAT THIS IS A REALLY POTENT TOOL THAT PROVIDED ITS GIVEN SAFELY AND GONE ABOUT SAFELY IS GIVING YOU THE KINDS OF INCREASES IN DOPAMINE THAT YOU WOULD SEEK USEIN PRESCRIPTION FARMOCOLOGY NOW SHOULD BE USE AS A RESPLACEMENT FOR PRESCRIPTION FHARMOCOLOGY ALTHOUGH PEOPLE HAVE DONE THAT TO SUCCESS ONE OF THE PREVIOUS GUESS ON THE HUBERAN LABPODCAST WHO IS DOCTOR ONALEMPKI ARE DIRECTOR OF THE DULL DIAGNOSIS ADDICTION CLINICAT STAMFORD SHIS IN AMAZING BOOK CALLED DOPAMIN NATION ALL ABOUT DOPAMINE AND BOTH ITS USES HEALTHY AND ITS PER OLS IN THINGS LIKE ADDICTION AND SHE DESCRIBES A PATIENT OF HERS THAT USE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE TO TRY AND MAINTAIN DOPAMINE LEVELS WHILE COMING OFF OF DRUGS THAT WERE INCREASING DOPAMIE SOPOTELI THAT THEY WERE PUTTING HIM DOWN THE PATH OF ADDICTION SO THE USE OF COLD WATER FOR INCREASING DOPAMINE IS A REAL TOOL IT'S I WOULD SAY A POWER TOOL IN FACT IT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT IF YOU WANT INCREASE DOPAMNE FOR SAKE OF MOTIVATION IT MIGHT BE YOUR FIRST GO TOO PROVIDED YOUR ALSO DOING THE THINGS TO MAINTAIN DOPAMINE BASE LINE LIKE SUNLIGHT EXPOSURE IN PARTICULAR MAKING SURE YOUR GETTING SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS OF TYROSINE CONTAINING FOODS AND SO ON AND NOW JUST VERY BRIEFLY OU ON A POINT TO A FEW QUICK TOOLS THAT GOOD PURE O VIEW DATA TELL US CAN BE LEVERAGE IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HALF SUFFICIENT DOPAMINE WHEN YOU WANT IT OR THAT IT'S AVAILABLE FOR IT TO BE RELEASED BY ANY NUMBER OF THE TOOLS I'VE PROVIDED THUS FAR AND THOSE ARE SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF BE VITEMENS SO IT TURNS OUT THAT BE VITEMENS IN PARTICULAR BE SIX OR VITEMAN BE SIX CAN POTENTLY REDUCE PROLACTIN LEVELS AND AGAIN PROLACTON IN DOPAMIN TEN TO WORK IN KONT OF PUSHPOLL FASHION THAT SAID YOU SHOULD BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT TAKING EXCESSIVE LEVELS OF BE SIX IT IS AVIDEMENT THAT IF YOU TAKE TOO MUCH YOU'LL LIKELY EXCREET IT THROUGH YOUR URINE BUT THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT HAVING EXCESSIVELY HIGH LEVELS OF BE SIX OR SUPPLEMENTING WITH EXCESSIVELY HIGH LEVELS OF BE SIX CAN CAUSE SOME PERIFERAL NOROPATHY SOME DEATH OF NERVES IN THE PRITH PERIFERY YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT DOSAGE LEVELS ARE RELEVANT THERE TOT SIMPLY LOOK AT UP ON LINE THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THIS BUT YOU DO ONT TO MAKE SURE THEYYU'RE GETTING ENOUGH BE SIX BE TWELVE ET CETERA SUCH THAT YOU CAN KEEP PROLACTON LEVELS IN CHECK AND IF YOU SUSPECT THAT YOU HAVE A DOPAMINE DEFICIENCY PLEASE TALK YOUR DOCTR AN TALK TO THEM ABOUT WAYS YOU MIGHE ADJUST THAT PROLACTIN DOWN AND THEREBY DOPAMINE UP THE OTHER WAY TO IN SURE THAT DOPAMINE LEVELS STAY HIGH OR PUT DIFFERENTLY THAT YOU DON'T QUASH WHATEVER DOPAMIN YOU HAVE IN YOUR SYSTEM IS TO REALLY AVOID BRIGHT LIGHT EXPOSURE TO YOUR EYES BETWEEN THE HOURS OF TEN P M AND FORIAM OR ANOTHER WAY PUTTING THIS BECAUSE I REALIZE PEOPLE SLEEP AT DIFFERENT TIMES ET CETERA IS TO AVOID BRIGHT LIGHT EXPOSURE TO YOUR EYES NOT JUST BLUE LIGHT BUT ALL COLOURS OF LIGHT IN FASE THREE THAT IS SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER WAKING UP BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY WHEN YOU SHOULD BE ASLEEP OR TRYING TO GET ASLEEP IF YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLES SLEEPING WORK FROM SAMMER HOTAR'S LAB THE DIRECTUR OF THE CHRONOBILOGY UNIT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES A MENTAL HEALTH AGAIN AN  I PREVIOUS HUBROM LAB PODCAST GUEST TELL US THAT BRIGHT LIGHT EXPOSURE IN FASE THREE OF YOUR CIRCADIAN CYCLE SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER WAKING CAN HAVE DRAMATIC EFFECTS IN REDUCING DOPAMINE LEVELS BY WAY OF ACTIVATING IN NURL CIRCUIT IN VOLVINGS ON THE CALL THE HABENULA WHENT A GET INTO TOO MANY DETAILS RIGHT NOW BUT REALLY TRYIANG KEEP THE LIGHTS DIM IN THE MILL THE NIGHT OR OFF IF YOU CAN DO THAT SAFELY TO REALLY GOING TO HELP IF YOURE TURNING ON YOUR PHONE BRIGHTLY IF YOU ARE TU NTING ON BRIGHT LIGHTS IT'S NOT JUST GOING TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT MELLATONAN THE HORM ON THE HELPS YOU FALL IN STAY ASLEEP IT'S ALSO GOING TO NEGATIVE TOLY IMPACT DOPAMING LEVELS NOT JUST THAT NIGHT BUT THE SUBSEQUENT DAY SO THAT MORE OR LESS SUMMARISES OUR COVERAGE OF WAYS TO USE BEHAVIOUR AND SUPPLEMENTATION AND NUTRITION TO INCREASE DOPAMING AND DOPAMYING RECEPTER EFFICACY AN NUMBER AND TO KEEP SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS OF DOPAMING IN YOUR SYSTEM DAY TO DAY FOR MOTIVATION MOOD AND FOCUS AND OF COURSE KEEP IN MIND THOSE THINGS THAT CAN SUPPRESSDOPAMING THE BRIGHT LIGHT EXPOSURE ELEVATED PROLACTON AND SO ON MY HOPE IS THAT BY UNDERSTANDING THOSE TOOLS AND HOW THEY WORK AND UNDERSTANDING THAT DOPAMING DOES CERTAIN THINGS AND NOT OTHERS THAT YOU CAN ASSEMBLE A VERSATILE KIT OF BEHAVIORS AND OTHER THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO IN ORDER TO ADJUST YOUR DOPAMEAN LEVELS ACCORDING TO YOUR PARTICULAR GOALS I WANT A JUST BRIEFLY RETURN TO THE FACT HOWEVER THAT ALL OF THAT IS RIDING ON THAT FASE ONE FASE TO BACKGROUND MEANING IT'S PROBABLY GIN TO TAKE LESS COLD WATER EXPOSURER I SHOULD SAY LESS TIME DOING COLD WATER EXPOSURE EARLY IN THE DAY TO GET A BIG INCREASE IN DOPAMING THAN IT WOULD LATER IN THE DAY BECAUSE LATER IN THE DAY YOUR BASELINE LEVELS OF DOPAMINE ARE LOWER NDYOU'VE GOT MORE SERTONE AND CIRCULATING THAT SHOULD MAKE SENSE TO YOU NOW AS TO WHY THAT'S THE CASE AND DOES THAT MEAN THAT YOU SHOULD REALLY MODIFY YOUR PROTOCALS DRAMATICALLY PROBABLY NOT BUT YOU MIGHT KEEP THAT IN MIND THAT IF FOR INSTANCE YOU NEED TO BE IN A HIGHLY MODOF ATED FOCUS STATE IN THE LATE PART OF THE DAY FOR WHATEVER REASON IT MIGHT TAKE A FEW OR MORE OF THESE TOOLS IN COMMINATION IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THAT WERE AS IF YOURE SOMEBODY WHO FEELS PRETTY GOOD DURING THE DAY BUT YOUR KIND OF LACKING MOTIVATION YOU WANT INCREASE DOPAMING LEVELS AN YOU DON'T YET NEED TO OR WANT TO RESORT TO PRESCRIPTION DRUGS OR SUPPLEMENTATION WOR THEN YOU MIGHT LAYER IN A COUPLE BEHAVIOR OF PROTOCALLS PAYING ATTENTION TO OF COURSE THE THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT BE DOING THAT WOULD ALSO POTENTIALLY SUPPRESSED OPAMINE SO AGAIN THAT KIT OF TOOLS IS DESIGN FOR YOU TO PLAY WITH IF YOU CHOOSE OF ITS SAFE FOR YOU TO APPLY THEM THAN DO THAT CONSIDER DOING THEM INDIVIDUALLY NOT TRING TO HIT ALL THE TOOLS ALL AT ONCE RIGHT I MEAN TO WHY THROW ALL THOSE TOOLS AT YOUR DOPAMING SYSTEM AT ONCE BETTER WOULD BE TO HAVE THOSE TOOLS IN YOUR KIT AND BE ABLE TO DEPLOY THEM DEPENDING ON WHETHER NOT YOU'R OWN TRAVEL WHETHER NOT YOUR EATING WELL OR LESS WELL WHETHER NT YOUR SLEEPING WELL OR LESS WELL THAT'S HIGHLY INDIVIDUAL AND I LIKE TO THINK THAT IN HAVING THOSE TOOLS IN HAND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO ADJUST THEM AND APPLY THEM IN THE WAYS THAT ALLOW YOU TO ACCESS THE DOPAMING INCREASES THAT YOU'RE AFTER SO NEXT I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT EPINEFRAN ALSO CALLED ADRENALINE WHEN A POINT OUT THAT EPINEFERON IS RELEASED BOTH IN THE BRAIN AND THE BODY IN FACT THERE'S A BARRIER BETWEEN BRAIN AND BODY THAT PREVENTS THE EPINEFRIN THAT'S RELEASE FROM YOUR DRENAL GLANDS CROSSING THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER SO YOUR BRAIN HAS A SEPARATE SIGHT CALLED THE LOCUS SERULIUS THIS IS A COLLECTION OF NURONS IN THE BACK OF THE BRAIN THAT COND OF SPRINKLEOR THE REST OF THE BRAIN WITH EPINEFERAN AND ESSENTIALLY WAKE SUP WHATEVER NERAL CIRCUITS HAPPEN TO SEE OR I SHOULD SAY A WAKE UP ANY CIRCUITS WERE THAT EPINEFERAN HAPPENS TO ARRIVE AND GENERALLY INCREASE THE EXCITABILITY OF THOSE NETWORKS THAT'S WHY WE SAY EPINEFERAN INCREASES ENERGY I'M NOT STALKING ABOUT COLORIC ENERGY ALTHOUGH THAT'S DISTANTLY RELATED TO THIS BUT REALLY ENERGY AND THE DESIRE TO MOVE THE FEELING THAT WE CAN THINK THE FEELING THAT WE CAN BE ALERT IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT SOMEBODY IN THEIR EYELIDS ARE WIDE OPEN IN LARGE PART THAT'S BECAUSE OF A LOT OF A DRENALINE IN THEIR SYSTEM IF THEIR PUPILS ARE REALLY BIG AND THEIR EYES ARE REALLY WIDE OPEN IN GENERAL THAT MEANS THEY HAVE A LOT OF EPINEFERAN CIRCULATING THERE WHEREAS WHEN WE'RE TIRED AND WE ARE KIND OF HOODID AND WORSS ORE F SLEEPY OR A PUPILS ARE REALLY SMALL IN GENERAL THAT'S BECAUSE LEVELS OF EPINEFERAN AND ALSO DOPENME RMEMBER THEY WORK TOGETHER LEVELS OF EPINEPERAN AND DOPENING TEND TO BE LOWER THIS IS ALSO WHY WHEN PEOPLE TAKE ANY DRUG LIKE AGAIN NOT RECOMMENDING THIS AMPHEDAMINE OR COCANE OR ANY STIMULANT THEIR PUPILS TEND TO BEHUGE THEIRE EYES TEND TO BE WIDE OPEN THEY DON'T BLINK VERY OFTEN AND THE OPPOSITES TRUE WHEN PEOPLE TAKE SEDITIVES SO IT ALSARTS TO MAKE SENSE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE BASIC ACTIONS OF THESE THINGS FOR MANY PEOPLE INCREASING A DRENALINE OR EPINEFERAN MIGHT SEEM LIKE A CRAZY IDEA MOST PEOPIL PROBABLY ASSOCIATE THIS SMALLECULE WITH STRESS AND THEY IT WOULD LIKE TO BE LESSTRESSED AND WE'VE DONE ENTIRE EPISODES ABOUT STRESS HOW TO MASTERO STRESS HOW TO LEVERD STRESS HOW TO CONCER STRESS OR LOT OF GREAT TOOLS TO DO THAT THAT AR BEHAVIORAL SUPPLEMENTATION BAYSED PLE SEE THE EPISODE ON MASTERING STRESS FOR THOSE TOOLS BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE INCLUDING ME THAT WANT TO INCREASE OUR LEVELS OF EPINEFRAN AT LEAST EARLY IN THE DAY I'M SOMEBODY WAKES UP RATHER SLOWLY IN FACT RIGHT AFTER WAKING OUT I RARELY ONE ABOUNCS OUT OF BED I TRY AND PUSH MYSELF TO DO THAT I'M ALWAYS IMPRESSED BY THESE A CHOCKA WILLINK TYPES THAT ARE UP AT FOR THIRTY OR UP AT FIVE AND ALREADY INTO ACTION I TEND TO BE KIND OF THINKING ABOUT THINKING ABOUT MAYBE BEING IN ACTION EARLY IN THE DAY BUT I TRY AND PUSH MYSELF TO GET INTO ACTION WHICH ITSELF CAN INCREASE EPINEFERAN I SHOULD MENTION THAT ANY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ANY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WALKING RUNNING WAIGHT LIFTING SWIMMING EVEN TALKING FOR THAT MATTER IS GOING TO INCREASE LEVELS OF EPINEFERAN LOCUS CERULIOUS IS A BRAIN STRUCTURE THAT IS TIGHTLY COUPLED WITH BEHAVIORS IN A BY DIRECTIONALWAY THAT IS WHEN YOU ARE IN ACTION YOU INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF EPINEPERAN RELEASE FROM LOCUS RULIUS YOU WAKE UP THE BRAIN AND CONVERSELY WHEN LOCUS CERULIOUS IS ACTIVE THE BRAIN WAKES UP SO IT'S RECYPRICAL IT GOES BOTH DIRECTIONS SO I SHA FUNNY TREAT ACTUALLY EARLIER TO DAY IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE GOING TO THE GIM GIVES YOU ENERGY BUT YOU NEED ENERGY TO GO TO THE GIM SOUNDS LIKE A PYRAMID SCHEME TO ME WHICH MANDE ME CHUCKLE BUT OF COURSE OVERLOOKS THE FACT THAT INDEED IF YOU HAVE ENERGY YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE WILLING TO GET INTO PHYSICAL MOVEMENT OR COGNIT OF MOVEMENT AND THINKING HARD OR THINKING A LOT ABOUT SOMETHING BUT ALSO IT IS ABSOLUTELY SCIENTIFICALLY PROVIN THAT BEING IN ACTION INCREASES LEVELS OF EPINEFRAN THIS IS WHY EXERCISING EARLY IN THE DAY GIVES YOU MORE ENERGY FOR REST OF DAY YOU STILL MIGHT EXPERIENCE A LOA BIT OF A CRASH IN THE AFTERNOON SPUCHIL IF YOU'RE GETTING OUP EXTRA EARLY OR IF YOU'RE DRINKING CAFFINE TOO CLOSE TO WAKING I'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE IF YOU DRINK TOO MUCH CAFFINE CLOSE TO WAKING YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE AN AFTERNOON CRASH BETTER TO PUSH THAT CAFFINE IN TAKE OUT ABOUT NINETY TO A HUNDRED TWENTY MINUTES AFTER WAKING I KNOW THIS IS REALLY PAINFUL FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE BUT CAFFINE DOES INCREASE EPINEFRAN CAFFINE DOES OTHER THINGS TO LIMIT SLEEPINESS AND BY PUSHINGIT OUT NINETY TO A HUNDRED TWENTY MINUTES AFTER WAKING YOU WILL AVOID THE AFTERNOON CRASH TO A LARGE DEGREE AND IF YOU GET UP AND YOU EXERCISE OR EVEN DO ANY MOVEMENT OF ANY KIND A HUNDRED JUMPING JACKS OR A WALK IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT ANYTHING LIKE THAT WILL INCREASE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF EPINEFRAN THAT YOU SECRETE INTO YOUR BLOOD STREAM AND IN YOUR BRAIN AND WILL GET YOU MORE ENERGY NOTJUST IN THAT MOMENT BUT THROUGHOUT THE DAY SO KEEP THAT IN MIND EXERCISE DOES INDEED GIVE YOU ENERGY IT BURNS COLORIC ENERGY BUT IT GIVES YOU NURL ENERGY BY WAY OF INCREASING EPINEFFRAN TRANSMISSION FROM LOCUSTS SERULIUS AND PRESUMABLY IF THE EXERCISES INTENSE ENOUGH A DRENALINE EPINEFFRAN RELEASE FROM THE ADDRENALS WITHIN YOUR BODY AS WELL SO WE HAVE EXERCISE AND WE HAVE CAFFINE AS POTENT TOOLS FOR INCREASING EPINEFFERAN AND THEREBY ENERGY ANOTHER POTENT TOOL THAT'S PURELY BEHAVIORAL BUT IS KNOWN TO WORK BASED ON EXCELLENT STUDIES IN HUMANS AND ACTUALLY MY LABORATORY HAS BEEN DOING SIMILARC TYPES OF STUDIES THAT ARE SOON TO BE PUBLISHED WE HOPE IS SO CALLD SICLIC HYPE ROVENTILATION SOME OF YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH WHIMHOFF BREATHING THERE'S ALSO TWO MOE BREATHING WHICH IS VERY SIMILAR CUNDOLINI BREATHING ALL OF THOSE STILES OF BREATHING INVOLVE SICLIC HY PEREVENTILATION DEEP INHALS AND EITHER PASSIVE EXAILS OR ACTIVE EXAILS BUT REPEATING INHAL EXAL INHEL EXAL IN A VERY DEEP IN REPETITIVE WAY IF YOU WERE TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU DO IT THROUGH YOUR NOSE OR MOUTH ALTHOUGH I DEAL YOU WOULD DO THE INHAIL THROUGH YOUR NOSE AND THE EXAILE THROUGHYOUR MOUTH IF YOU DID THAT FOR TWENTY FIVE REPETITIONS TWENTY FIVE INHALS AND EXAILS YOU WOULD FEEL MORE ALERT YOU'D ALSO FEEL MORE WARM WHY BECAUSE YOU INCREASED EPINEFRAN A DRENOLINE RELEASE IN THE BRAIN AND BODY IT WORKS THE FIRST TIME AND IT WORKS EVERY TIME TO INCREASE EPINEFRAN AND THEREBY ENERGY AND IN FACT THERE ARE PROTOCALS AND GREAT SCIENTIFIC STUDIES OF USING SYCLICYPE ROVENTILATION FOR PERIODS OF MINUTES IF NOT LONGER WHERE FOR INSTANCE YOU WOULD DO TWENTY FIVE BIG INHALS AN EXAILS FOLLOWED BY BRIEF BREATHHOLD WITH YOUR LONGS EMPTY THAN REPEAT TWENTY FIVE THAN BRIEF BREATH HOLD EXCUSE ME EXHAILE HOLD YOUR LUNGS EMPTY AND THEN REPEAT AGAIN FOR A THIRD ROUND IF YOU LIKE IF YOU DO THAT OVER AND OVER YOU'RE GOING TO BE VERY ALERT YOU CAN HAVE MORE ENERGY GOING TO FEEL LIKE YOU WANT TO MOVE AROUND A LOT MORE IN FACT YOU MIGHT EVEN FEEL AGITATE IT SO PEOPLE WITH A LOT OF ANXIETY OR PRONOPANIC ATTACK MIGHT WANT O BE CAUTIOUS AN HOW THEY TRAIN AND EMBARK ON THAT TYPE OF BREATHING MIGHT WANT APPROACH IT A LITLE MORE CAREFULLY OR AVOIDED ALTOGETHER BUT FOR MOST PEOPLE SYCKLICIPEROVENTILATION IS SIMPLY GOING TO GET YOU MORE ENERGIZED AND FEELING LIKE YOU WANT TO MOVE FEELING LIKE YOU CAN THINK MORE CLEARLY AND YOU WILL BE MORE WIDE EYED AND ALERT BECAUSE YOU ARE RELEASING A DRENALIN AND THE COLD WATER EXPOSURE PROTO CALL THAT I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER AND THAT'S COVERED IN OUR EPISODE ON COLD AND IN THE NEWS LETTER ON COLD WELL THAT AS I MENTION EARLY ARE POTENTLY INCREASES DOPAMING BUT ALSO EPINEFERANE SO THAT'S ANOTHER TERRIFIC TOOL WHETHER OR NOT ITS APPLIED BY COLD SHOWER OR COLD IMERSION OR SOME OTHER THING LIKE CRIO THAT IS GOING TO MAKE YOU MORE ALERT BECAUSE IT RELEASES A DRENLIN NOW WE CAN'T REALLY SAY THAT THERE ARE FOODS TO INCREASE EPINEFERAN RATHER THERE ARE FOODS THAT INCLUD A LOT OF TYRICINE THAT WILL INCREASE DOPAMING AND REMEMBER DOPAMING IS THE MOLECULE FROM WHICH EPINEFERAN IS SYNTHESIZED SO WE CAN'T REALLY POINT TO A PARTICULAR FOOD OR CATEGORIES OF FOOD FOR INCREASING EPINEFRAN I THINK KAFFINE AND THINGS LIKE IT WILL INCREASE EPINEFRAN THERE ARE OF COURSE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT WILL INCREASE EPINEFRAN AND OF COURSE THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF SO CALLED BATE ABLOCKERS THAT WILL BLOCK THE RECEPTORS FOR EPINEFERAN TO MAKE YOU FEEL CALM FOR PUBLIC SPEAKING OR FOR VARIOUS HEART CONDITIONS ET CETERA THAT'S REALLY THE DOMAIN OF PHYSICIONS AND SHOULD REALLY BE WORKED OUT WITH YOUR CARDEOLOGISTS WITH A PHYSICIAN ET CETERA I THINK THE TOOLS OF EXERCISE AND SHOULD YOU WANT VERY POTENT INCREASES IN A DRENALIN HIG INTENSITY EXERCISE AS WELL AS THE TOOLS OF KAFFINE SYCKLICCOPEROVENTILATION AND DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE REALLY COMBINE TO GIVE YOU A NICE LITTLE KIT AT WIS A VERSITILE KIT OF WAYS TO INCREASE UPINEFRN FOR SAKE OF HAVING MORE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL ENERGY SO NEXT IS THE NAUROMODULATOR ASEETO CALLING AND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER ASEETL COLING IS ASSOCIATED WITH STATES OF FOCUS AND NO STATES OF FOCUS CAN BE HIGH ENERGY STATES OF FOCUS SO THE ONES THAT ARE ACCOMPANIED BY HIGH LEVELS OF DOPOMINE AN EPINEFERAN AND WERE WERE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT AND REALLY LAZERED IN ON SOMETHING OR THEY CAN BE THE CALMER OR MORE RELAXED STATES OF FOCUS LIKE READING A BOOK OR PRACTISING MUSIC OR LISTENING VERY CAREFULLY TO SOMEBODY IN A WAY THAT'S RELAXED AND CALM AND YET NONE THE LESS WHERE WE HAVE A NARROW COGNITIVE AND TYPICALLY A NARROW VISUAL APERTURE AND TYPICALLY ALSO A NARROW AUDITORY APERTURE THAT IS ARE AUDITORY SYSTEM AN OUR VISUAL SYSTEM AND OUR THINKING CAN BE VERY BROAD IT CAN BE ALL OVER THE PLACE OR IT CAN BE VERY NARROW AND IT CAN BE VERY FOCUSED A SEEDAL COLLING IS RELEASED FROM TOO MAJORCITES IN THE BRAIN NEWCLEASE PISALUS WHICH IS IN THE FOREBRAIN AND EXTENDS CONNECTIONS OUT TO MANY DIFFERENT BRAIN AREAS TO OFFER THE OPPORTUNITY TO RELEASE A SEDO COLING LOCALLY AND MORE LESS IN A CHEMICAL WAY HIGH LIGHT THOSE PARTICULAR NERONS AND SYNAPSES FOR STRENGTHENING FOR PLASTICITY LATER AND IT IS RELEASED FROM SITES IN THE BACK OF THE BRAIN IN A WAY THAT CAN INCREASE THE SO CALLED FIDELITY OF INFORMATION COMING IN THROUGH OUR EYES OUR EARS ORE KNOWS AT CETERA WHAT I MEAN BY FIDELITY WHILE WE ARE CONSTANTLY BEING BOMBARDED WITH SENSORY INFORMATION THROUGH ALL OV OUR VARIOUS SENSES AND A SEDO COLING WRELEASE FROM THIS ARY IN THE BACK OF THE BRAIN HAS THE ABILITY TO INCREASE THE EXTENT TO WHICH SAY VISUAL INFORMATION OR JUST VISUAL AN AUDITORY INFORMATION WOULD MAKE IT THROUGH TO OUR CONSCIOUSNESS WHEREAS ALL THE OTHER TYPES OF SENSORY INFORMATION THAT ARE COMERING IN ARE FILTERED OUT SO YOUR BRAIN BECAUSE ITS TAKING IN ALL THIS INFORMATION NEEDS TO DECIDE WHAT TO PAY ATTENTION TO AND IN THIS WAY WE CAN SAY THAT A SEDO CLING HAS A LOT TO DO NOT JUST WITH FOCU S IN ERQUOTES BUT LITERALLY ATTENTION WHICH NERL SIGNALS BECOME RELEVANT TO OUR CONSCIOUSNESS THERE'S A WHOLE DISCUSSION TO BE HAD THERE AND WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THAT RATHER I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON WHAT ARE THE TOOLS THAT ONE CAN USE TO MAINTAIN HEALTHY BASE LINES OF A SETO COLING AND INCREASE A SEDO COLING FOR SAKE OF LEARNING ANY TYPE OF INFORMATION PHYSICAL COGNITIVE ARE OTHERWISE NOW TURNS OUT THERE BEEN A LOT OF STUDIES INCLUDING MANY QUALITY PEREVIEWED STUDIES CARRIED OUT IN HUMANS LOOKING AT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU INCREASE A SEDO COLING LEVELS IN THE BRAIN AND YOU ACCOMPANY THAT WITH THE ATTEMPT TO LEARN AND WHAT YOU FIND ALMOST ALWAYS IS THAT PEOPLE EXPERIENCE INCREASED FOCUS THAT WHEN MEASURED THE NURONAL RESPONSES BECOME MORE SPECIFIC SO LESS BROAD SCALE ACTIVITY IN THE BRAIN AND MORE SPECIFIC NERL CIRCUIT ACTIVITY AND THAT THIS TRIGGERS IMMEDIATE AND LONGLASTING CHANGES IN THE WAY THOSE CIRCUITS WORK EVEN WHEN A SEDO COLING IS NOT BEING DEPLOYED SO CALLED NEURO PLASTISY THE CIRCUITS LITERALLY CHANGE SO THIS IS GREAT THE WORK OF MICHAEL SILVER AT BERCALLY THE WORK OF MICHAMERSINICAT YOU SEE A SAV THE WORK OF MICHAEL KILGAR DOWN IN TEXAS ALL OF THOSE LABORATORYS SEE THIS AGAIN AND AGAIND AGAIN INCREASE A SEDO COLING BEFORE ENDOYING LEARNING AND THERE'S A MUCH HIGHER PROBABILITY THAT THE LEARNING WILL CUOTE IN QUO SINK IN THAT THE INFORMATION WILL BE RETAINED BECAUSE THOS NERAL CIRCUITS CHANGE NOW WAYSE TO INCREASE O SETO COLING IN A POTENT WAY INCLUDE AGAIN NUTRICION AND SUPPLEMENTATION IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE BASE LINE LEVELS OF A SETO COLING BE SUFFICIENTLY HIGH AS WELL AND FOR THAT REALLY THE IDEAL SITUATION IS TO REGULARLY INJEST FOODS THAT PROVIDE ENOUGH OF THE PRECURSERS FOR A SEDO COLING TO BE MADE IF YOU GO ON LINE AND YOU WERE TO DO A SEARCH OF WHICH FOODS CONTAIN A LOT OF COLING WHICH IS RELATED TO THE SENTHESIS OF A SEDTO COLING YOU WOULD GET SOME INTERESTING INFORMATION BACK FOR INSTANCE BEEF LIVER IS THE MOST POTENT SOURCE OF COLING I KNOW NOWDAYS ARS KIND OF A GROWING M ICROTREND IF YOU WILL OF INJESTING BEEFLIVER EVEN RAW LIVER WHICH TO BE OST THE THOUGHT OF IN JESTING RAW LIVER OF ANY KIND ACTIVATES MY AREA POSTREMA WHICH IS THE ARY THE BRAIN THAT TRIGGERS NAUSEA INFECT I 'M STROYING TO SALIVATE A BIT NOT BECAUSE I'M HUNGRY BUT THE WHOLE CONCEPT MAKES ME ILL NONE THE LESS COOKED LIVER UM OR RAW LIVER FOR THAT MATTER OR LIVER OF ANY KIND SEEMS TO CONTAIN A LOT OF COALIG I REALIZE MOST PEOPLE MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO BE RUNNING OUT AND INJESTING LARGE MOUNTS OF BEEF LIVER EGGS CONTAIN A LOT OF COALING BEEF CONTAINS COALING SOIBINGS CONTAIN COALING SO THERE ARE VIGAN OR NON MEAT SOURCES CHICKEN FISH MUSHROOMS KIDNEY BEINGS THESE SORTS OF THINGS CONTAIN A LOT OF COALING AND THEREARE OTHER VEGETABLES THAT CONTAIN COALING SO DEPENDING ON YOUR DIETARY PREFERENCES IN NEEDS YOU CAN OM SELECT CERTAIN FOODS A TO INJEST TO GET ENOUGH COALING TO SYNTHESIZE ENOUGH BASE LINE A SETAL COALING IN THE REALM OF SUPPLEMENTATION THERE ARE SOME EXCELLENT TOOLS FOR INCREASING A SEATO COALING IN THE ACUTE SHORT TERM MEANING OVER THE COURSE OF ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES OUT TO ABOUT TWO HOURS OR MAYBE VEN FOUR HOURS AND THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MOLECULES THAT CAN DO THAT THAT ARE AVAILABLE WITHOUT A PRESCRIPTION AT LEAST IN THE USS IS PRETTY VAST THE MOST COMMON OF THOSE MOLECULES IS ACTUALLY NICOTINE NICOTINIC A SEATO COALING RECEPTORS ARE ABUNDANT THROUGHOUT THE BODY AND BRAIN THERE IN VARIOUS BRAIN CIRCUITS THEY ARE ON MUSCLE AND YES SMOKING NICOTINE EITHER BY VAPING OR CIGARETTE WILL ACTIVATE THOSE NICOTENIC RECEPTERS BUT OF COURSE SMOKING IS A TERRIBLE THING IT WILL ALSO ACTIVATE THINGS LIKE LONG CANCER SO I DETLIY DON'T RECOMMEND THAT IT ALSO ACTIVATES A DICTION BECAUSE OF THE WAYS THAT IT TRIGGERS ACTIVATION OF THE DOPOMINE CIRCUIT SO I THINK THAT TRIGGERING ACTIVATION OF A SEATO CALING RELATED PATHWAYS BY INJESTING NICOTINE BY WAY OF INHALENTS IS GENERALLY A BAD IDEA HOWEVER SOME PEOPLE WILL TO NICORET OR OTHER NICOTINE TYPE GUMS I'VE NEVER DONE THAT BUT O FRIENDS WHO ACTUALY RELY ON THAT THESE ARE TYPICALLY FORMER SMOKERS THAT ARE TRYING NOT TO SMOKE BUT STILL WANT TO GET SOME OF THE FOCUS ENHANCEMENT THAT THEY EXPERIENCE FROM NICOTINE SOME PEOPLE ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO NICOTINE AND THIS IS IMPORTANTSOME PEOPLE ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO INJESTED NICOTINE SO NOWDAYS THEIR NICOTINE A DIPPED TOOTHBICS THERE OF COURSES NICTINE GUM AND OTHER SOURCES OF NICOTINE SOME PEOPLE CAN TAKE THAT AND FEEL FINE SOME PEOPLE TAKE IT AND FEEL ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE I CONFESS I'D NEVER ACTUALLY TRIED NICOTINE IN ANY OF THOSE FORMS SO I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY WORK FOR ME BUT SOME PEOPLE DO USE THEM AS COGNIVE IN HANCERS IN FACT I KNOW ONE NOBELL PRIZE WINNING NORRO SCIENTISTS WHOS QUITE WELL KNOWN IN OUR FIELD FOR CHEWING NIKER AT ALL THEY LONG HE INSIST THAT IT REALLY HELPS HEM WITH HIS FOCUS AND HE IS EXCEEDINGLY SMART AND PRODUCTIVE ALTHOUGH I'M SURE THERE ARE OTHER REASONS FOR THAT SUPPLEMENTS THAT I HAVE USED AND DO USE FOR INCREASING A SETO COALING AR THING S LIKE ALPHAG P C OR HOOPERSIN ALPHAG P C IS IN THE COLING PATHWAY SUCH THAT MORE ASEET OF COLINE IS SYNTHESIZED AFTER YOU INGEST IT THAT'S THE GENERAL LOGIC OR FRAMEWORK OF HOW IT WORKES WHEREAS HOOPERSINE IS MAINLY IN THE ENSEMATIC PATHWAY IT TENDS TO A JUST HOW MUCH A SEATO CULLING IS BROKEN DOWN AND LEAD TO NET INCREASES IN A CETO COLING I WILL OFTEN TAKE THREE HUNDRED MELIGRAMS OF ALPHA G P C PRIOR TO WORKOUTS OR PRIOR TO COGNITIVE WORK BOUTS BUT WHEN I SAY OFTEN I TEND TO DO THIS ANYWHERE FROM THREE TO FOUR TIMES A WEEK TYPICALLY NOT EVERY DAY ALTHOUGH THERE ARE PEOPLE INCLUDING PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO OFFSET AGRELY COGNIVE DECLINE THAT WILL TAKE THREE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF ALPHAG P C THREE TIMES A DAY EVERY DAY WHICH CLOSELY MIMIC SOME OF THE STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE ON HUMANS LOOKING AT OFFSETTING AGRLA COGNIVE DECLINE USING THINGS LIKE ALPHAG P C I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW STUDIES A FEW NOT MANY BUT THIS TUDIES EMPHASIZE THAT PEOPLE WHO TAKE A LOT OF ALPHAG P C CHRONICALLY OVER TIME MAY BE AT INCREASED RISK FOR STROKE I THINK THE DATARE STILL OUT ON THAT AND WE NEED MORE DATA BUT FOR ME IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT THE RISK BENEFIT PROFILES TAKING THREE UNDRED MILIGRAMS OF ALPHA G P C MOST CERTAINLY DOES INCREASE MY ABILITY OF FOCUS I'VE NOTICE THAT I TAN TO TAKE IT ALONGSIDE CAFINE AND FENAL ETHEL AMING SO I TAKE THAT IN COMMINATION ITHERE BEFORE WORKOUTS AR WORKBOUTS REALLY SHARPENS MY FOCUS AND AGAIN I'M DOING THAT THREE MAY BE FOUR TIMES FOR WEEK AND I'M CAREFUL TO DO THAT IN THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY SO THAT IT DOES NOT DISRUPT MY SLEEP ALTHOUGH I HAVE TAKEN ALPHAG P C IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE DAY AND I HAD NO TROUBLE SLEEPING AT ALL I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE EXACT HALF LIFE IS OF THE GIVEN FORM THAT TYPICALLY IN SUPPLEMENTATION AS I SHAL HARD TO GET THAT INFORMATION BUT TYPICALLY THE FOCUS EFFECTS WEAR OFF AFTER ABOUT TWO MAY BE FOUR HOURS MAXIMUM NOW ONE THING THAT I DON'T THINK HAS EVER BEEN DISCUSSED BEFORE CERTAINLY NOT ON THIS PODCAST IS THAT IF YOU TAKE ALPHAG P C EVEN SEMI REGULARLY YOU MAY NOTICE THAT A PARTICULAR FEATURE OF YOUR BLOOD WORK WILL INCREA AND THAT T M A O WHICH IS SOMETIMES ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASE CARTYOF ASCULAR RISK THIS MAY AGAIN MAY RELATE TO SOME OF THE POTENTIAL RISK OF VERY HIGH LEVELS OF ALHAG P C INGESTION OVER MANY YEARS INCREASING STROKE RISK AGAIN THOSE STUDIES LOOK AT PEOPLE BEEN TAKING IT FORUPT TO A DECADE BUT IN ANY CASE ONE WAY TO PREVENT THE INCREASE IN T MA O IF YOU'RE TAKING ALPHAG P C AT ALL IS TO TAKE SIX HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF GARLIC BECAUSE IT CONTAINS ONE THE ALLED ALISON THIS WAS A A TRICK THAT WAS HANDED OFF TO ME BY DOCTOR CALGELETT WHO AGAIN WAS A GUEST ON THIS PODCAST SOME TIME AGO TALKING OUT HORMONES AND HORMON HEALTH TURNS OUT THAT IN GESTION OF SIX HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF ALISON A LONGSIDE OR EVEN JUST SAME DAY AS ALPHAG P C CAN REALLY CLAMP THOSE T MA O LEVELS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE INCREASE OF YOUR TAKING ALPHOCH P CE AND INDEED I'VE DONE THE BLOOD WORK AND THAT TURNS OUT TO BE THE CASE A SAUCE BY CANTIAMAEO I STARTED TAKING SIX HUNDR MILEGRAMS OF GARLIC AND THOSE TIAMEO LEVELS CAME DOWN AND LAST AS IT RELATES TO A SEDO COLING BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST JUST AS THE CEDO COLING CAN INCREASE FOCUS FOCUS CAN INCREASE A SEDO COLING I TALKED A LOT ABOUT THIS IN THE EPISODE ON FOCUS BUT THERE ARE BEHAVIORAL TOOLS THAT YOU CAN USE TO ANHANCE FOCUS THINGS ALIKE STARING INTA PARTICULAR VISUAL TARGET AT THE SAME DISTANCE AT WHICH YOURE GOING TO PERFORM SOME WORK AND DOING THAT FOR THIRTY IS SIXTY SECONDS NARROWING IN A VERY DELIBERATE WAY YOUR VISUAL FIELD AND THEN MOVING INTO A FOCUS T WORK ABOUT THAT BEHAVIORAL PRACTISE OF NARROWING YOUR VISUAL APERTURE WILL INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF A SEDOCOLING TRANSMISSION IN PARTICULAR NERAL CIRCUITS THAT WILL THEN MAKE IT EASIER TO FOCUS HOW DO WE KNOW THAT WELL I COVERED IN THAT EPISODE SOME OF THE PURE REVIEWED STUDIES THAT IT RELATE TO PROTOCALS THAT ARE NOW ACTIVELY BEING TOPLOYED IN SCHOOLS IN CHINA AND ELSEWHERE WHERE KIDS ARE DOING DELIBERATE VISUAL FOCUS EXERCISES IN ORDER TO INCREASE THEIR MENTAL FOCUS AND WHILE THEY ARE NOT DOING MICHRODIALYSIS AR BRAIN IMAGING ON THOSE KIDS IN REAL TIME THE COGNIVE EFFECTS AND INDEED THE PERFORMANCE EFFECTS IN TERMS OF ACADEMICABILITY AND OUTPUT ARE PRETTY IMPRESSIVE SO A CEDOCOLING INCREASES FOCUS WE TALKED ABOUT SOME DIATARY AND SOME SUPPLEMENTATION BATES WAYS TO INPROVE A CEDOCOLING OR ISHUS T INCREASE O SEDO COLING END THAT DOES IN FACT LEAD TO INCREASES IN ONE'S ABILITY TO FOCUS THIS IS WHY A LOT OF THE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR THE TREATMET OF ALCIMER IS ADERALY COGNIIVE DECLINE AND INDEED EVEN SOME OF THE DRUGS THAT TAP INTO TREATMENTS FOR EIGHTY EIGHTST ALSO INVOLVE THE ASEDOCOLING SYSTEM SO THERE'S NOTHING SURPRISING OR A HOREDICAL HERE BUT IT IS IMPORTAN TO POINT OUT THAT YOUR BEHAVIORAL ABILITY TO FOCUS IS ALSO RELATED TO YOUR ABILITY TO AXIS AN DEPLOYA SEDO COLING SO NEVER DO WE WANT PURELY PHARMICALOGIC TREATMENTS TO BE THE ONLY WAY THAT PEOPLE ARE INCREASING A GIVEN OROMOGULATOR I ALWAYS SAY BEHAVIORS FIRST THEN NUTRITION THEN SUPPLEMENTATION AND THEN IF THERE IS A NEED CERTAINLY A CLINICAL NEED THEN PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ET CETERA OF COURSE ADMINISTERED A THROUGH A PHYSICIAN SO LET'S DISCUSS SERATONAN CERATONAN AS I MENTIONE EARLIER AS ASSOCIATED WITH BRAIN EN BODY STATES OF WELL BEING OF COMFORT OF SOTIETY AND THEREFORE SHOULD COME AS NO SURPRISE THAT A LOT OF THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG TREATMENTS FOR THINGS LIKE TO PRESSION INVOLVE INCREASING LEVELS OF CERATONAN IN THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT SAID ANY TIME YOU TALK ABOUT PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FOR CERATONAN WE ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE OFTEN SIDAFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASING CERATONAN IN PARTICULAR CERATONAN LEVELS GO TO HIGH THAT IS IF THE DOSAGES OF THOSE TREATMENTS GO TOO HIGH PEOPLE WILL FOR INSTANCE FEEL REDUCED APPETITE REDUCED LIBIDO INCREASE LETHARGY ET CETERA END THERE'S A SO CALLE CERATON URGE ECCINDRUM ALL OF THAT KIN AND SHOULD BE CONCSIDERED WITH A WELL TRAINE PHYSICIAN SO BECAUSE THEIR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS CONTROLLING THE DOSAGE DECIDING WHAT DOSAGE TO TAKE DECIDING WHICH ESSESSARIDE TO TAKE AND WHETHER NOT TO COME OFF THOSE DRUGS HAW TO COME OFF THOSE DRUGS AGAIN ALL OF THAT SHOULD BE HANDLED WITH A LICENSED PHYSICIAN THAT SAID THERE ARE BEHAVIORAL TOOLS NUTRITIONAL TOOLS AND SUPPLEMENTATION TOOLS THAT CONTAPIN TO THE CARATONAN SYSTEM NOT TO THE SAME DEGRE IN POTENCY BUT NONE THE LESS IN WAYS THAT CAN STILL IMPACT OUR FEELINGS OF WELL BEING IN POSITIVE WAYS SO LET'S FOKUS FIRST ON THE BEHAVIORAL TOOLS AND SOME OF THESE MIGHT MAKE PEOPLE CHUCKLE A LITTLE BIT BUT I WANT O POINT OUT THAT A LOT OF THESE TOOLS ARE QUITE POTENT IN FACT THEY ARE POWER TOOLS FOR MODULATING SERATONAN AND WE KNOW THAT BASED ON HUMAN NROIMAGING STUDIES HUMAN AND ANIMAL MICRODIALYSIS STUDIES AND OTHER STUDIES THAT REALLY HAVE VALUATED CIRCULATING LEVELS OF CERATONAN AND THAT PARTICULAR BRAIN CIRCUITS THAT REALY SERATONAN WHEN PEOPLE DO CERTAIN THINGS WHAT SORTS OF THINGS WELL FOR INSTANCE PHYSICAL CONTACT IN PARTICULAR WITH LOVED ONES THIS CAN BE ROMANTIC LOVE THIS CAN BE A CHILDREN SO YOUR OWN CHILDREN OR A YOUR SPOUSE EVEN IF ITS NOT SECTUAL CONTACT FRIEND TO FRIEND CONTACT EVEN FRIEND TO ANIMAL CONTACT YOU KNOW AS AF FORMER DOGOWNER TOF ANOTHER DOGS SOON CAUSE INFORTUNATELY COSTELLO PASSED AWAY BUT THERE IS SOMETHING REALLY COMFORTING AND WONDERFUL ABOUT PETTING YOUR DOG AND CERTAINLY GIVEN THAT MANY OF THE STUDIES ON CERATONAN AND THESE OTHER NERMODULATORS WERE DONE ON ANIMAL MODELS WE ALSO KNOW THAT SARATONAN IS BEING EVOKED IN THE DOG AND OF COURSE IN THE CHILD AN IN THE SIGNIFICAN OTHER ET CETERA SO THINGS LIKE HOLDING HANDS BELIEVE OR NOT HUGS CUDDLING ET CETERA CAN INCREASE CARATON AND TRANSMISSION AND THEY MAKE PEOPLE FEEL GOOD THIS SHOULDN'T REALLY COME AS A SURPRISE THERE'S ALSO GRATITUDE AND WE DIDN'T ENTIRE EPISODE ABOUT GRATITUDE THERE'S LOT OF MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT GRATITUDE OFTENTIMES WHEN PEOPLE HERE GRATITUDE THEY THINK O GRATITUDE THIS IS JUST BEING THANKFUL FOR WHAT YOU HAVE AND ITS KIND OF A WEAK SAUCE OF FACT MEANING YELLTS CON ALIN ME MAYBE A L CARATONAN GOES UP OR MAYBE THERE'S LA BIT OF INCREASE FEELINGS OF WELL BEING NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH THAT TURNS OUT FIRST OF ALL THAT RECEIVING NOT GIVING GRATITUDE IS WHAT HAS THE MOST APPOTENT EFFECTS ON INCREASING SRATONAN AN ACTIVITY OF THE BRAIN CIRCUITS THAT INVOLVE CARATONAN IN THAT LEAD TO INCREASES IN FEELINGS OF WELL BEING IYS INTERESTING RECEIVING MUCH MORE THAN GIVING GRATITUDE IS WHAT ACTIVATES THO CARATONURGE IT PATHWAYS SO THE TAKE AWAY FROM THAT IS BOTH GIVE AND RECEIVE GRATITUDE AND OF COURSE DO IT IN AUTENTIC WAY THE OTHER THING ABOUT GRATITUDE THAT SOMEWHAT COUNTER INTUITIVE IS THAT OBSERVING OTHERS GIVING AND RECEIVING GRATITUDE IS IMMENSELY POWERFUL FOR EVOKING SRATONAN AND THE ACTIVITY OF SARATONURGE IC CIRCUITS IN YOU THE OBSERVER SO RECEIVING AND OBSERVING GRATITUDE TURNS OUT TO BE THE MOST POTENT WAY TO INCREASE SERATONAN IN THE BRAIN AND BODY AND THESE AGAIN ARE DRAMATIC EFFECTS THAT ARE QUITE LONG LASTING AND NOT THE SORTS OF EFFECTS THAT CAN LEA DECIDE EFFECTS AT LEAST THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK THEY WOULD NOW WOOT ABOUT NUTRITIONAL APPROACHES TO INCREASING SERATONAN WELL JUST AS WE HAVE TYRICENE AS AN EMENOACID PRECURSEOR UPSTREAM OF DOPEMIN SYNTHESIS WE HAVE DHE YOU MEANO ACID TRIP TO FAN WHICH IS UPSTREAM OF SERATONAN SYNTHESIS AND ONE SIMPLY HAS TO GO ON LINE AND PUT IN TRIP TO FAN CONTAINING FOODS AND YOU WILL DISCOVER THAT THERR LOT OF FOODS THAT ARE ENRICHED IN TRIP TO FAN THAT KAN LEAD TO NET INCREASES IN THE AMOUNT OF SERATONAN AVAILABLE IN THE BRAIN AND BODY THE MOST KIND OF FAMOUS ARE INFAMOUS OF THESE IS WHITE MEAT TURKEY THE SO CALL TRIP TO FAN EFFECT WHERE PEOPLE GET VERY SLEEPY AFTER EATING WHITE MEAT TURKEY AN IT IS INDEED HIGHLY ENRICHED IN TRIP TO FAN ALTHOUGH TYPICALLY THE GETTING SLEEPY AFTER EATING TURKEY IS A MOST OFTEN ASSOCIATE WITH THE THANKSGIVING MEAL AND THE THANKSGIVING MEAL LEAST IN THE YOUASSES OFTEN ASSOCIATE WITH PEOPLE VASTLY OVEREATING AND SO I DO ONE A POINT OUT THAT IF YOU FILL YOUR GOT WITH FOOD NO MATTER WHAT THAT FOOD IS THERE'S CAN BE A DIVERSION OF BLOODS YOURE GOT THAT'S CAN MAKE YOU FEEL SLEEPY BECAUSE THERE'S A DIVERSION OF BLOOD AWAY FROM OTHER TISSUES SO YE EAT A LIT YOU'RE GING TO GET SLEEPY PARIOD WEATHER NOT YOU EAT TURKEY OR SOME OTHER SUBSTANCE NONE THE LESS THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FOODS THAT CONTAIN A LOT OF TRIP TO AN AND THAT SOME PEOPLE WILL LEVERAGE O IN ORDER TO TRYING INCREASE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF CIRCULATING SERATONAN AVAILABLE TO THEM IN ORDER TO HAVE A MODEST INCREASE IN OVER ALL MOOD AND WELL BEING SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THESE FOODS THESE ARE THINGS LIKE MILK IN PARTICULAR WHOLE MILK SO FULL FAT MILK I KNOW NUMBER OF PEOPLE CHOOSE NOT TO DRINK MILK CAUSE THEY'RE LACTOS AND TOLERANCE I'M RAISING MY HAND AS OM ONE SUCH PERSON ALTHOUGH A NOOF THE KID I DID ENJOY MILK A KAND TUNA TURKEY AS WE MENTION BEFORE HIGH AND TRIP TO FAN OATS I AM A CONSUMER OF OAT MEAL SO THAT RESONATES WITH ME AM CHEES AND I HERE I READ ALTHOUGH NOT AS HIGH AND TRIP TO FAN AS MEATN OTHER DAIRY SOURCES A CERTAIN CHEEASES LIKE CHEDDAR CHEESES CAN BE RICH IN TRIP TO FAN CERTAIN NUTS AND SEEDS CERTAIN BREADS CHOCOLATE NO A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WILL BE RELIEVED TO HEAR THAT I KNOW CHOCOLATE LOVERS ARE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR AN EXCUSE TOCHOCOLATE I CONFESS I'VE NEVER REALLY LIKE CHOCOLATE EXCEPT DHERE I SAY I LIKE THE SMOOTH HUNDRED PER CENT CHOCOLATES I KNOW MANY PEOPLE GAGWHEN THEY HEAR HUNDRED PER CENT ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE THEM AND SOME FRUITS CAN BE HIGHLY EN RICHED IN TRIP TO FAN THINGS LIKE BANANNAS AND APPLES AND THINGS THAT SORT ALTHOUGH NOT NEARLY TO THE DEGREE OF THINGS LIKE TURKEY CAN TUNA AND MILK I'M SURE THERE ARE OTHER EXCELLENT SOURCES OF TRIP TO FAN FROM THE DIET INCLUDING A VEGAN SOURCES SO PLEASE PERUSE THE INNERNET TO TRY AND FIND THE SOURCES THAT ARE COMPATIBLE WITH YOUR NUTRITIONAL PROGRAM IF INDEED YOUR GOAL IS TO INCREASE TRIP TO FAN NOW THERE ARE SUPPLEMENTS THAT CAN INCREASE TRIP TO FAN AND CAN DO SO QUITE POTENTLY ONE OF T ONES THAT HAS RECEIVED IT INCREASING ATTENTION AS OF LATELY IS CISIS QUADRANGALARIS COMPLICATED NAME WHEN TAKEN IN DOSAGES OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TO SIX HUNDRED MILIGRAMS CAND PRETTY DRAMATICALLY INCREASE CERATONAN LEVELS IN FACT ANYWHERE FROM THIRTY PER CENT TO THIRTY NINE PER CENT INCREASES IN CIRCULATING SERATONAN THAT'S A BIG INCREASE AND I CAN PROVIDE A LINK TO THAT STUDY THE STUDY WAS FOCUS NOT SO MUCH ON SERATONAN BUT WAS FOCUSED MAINLY ON TREATMENT OF OBISITY AND APPETITE AND WEIGHT LOSS AND IT SHOULD COME AS NO SURPRISE THAT ERATONAN IF INCREASED MIGHT LEA TO D CREASES AN APPETITE A CAUTIONARY NOTE CISIS QUADRANGLARIS MAY NEED TO BE CYCLED HOW QUICKLY TO CYCLIC MEANING TOYOU DO TWO WEEKS ON TO WEEKS OFF WHETHER NOT YOU NEED TO DO MORE RAPPEDCYCLING LIKE TWO DAYS ON TWO DAYS OFF IS A MATTER OF DEBATE THERE NOT A LOT OF DATE ON THIS JUST YET THERE LOT OF OPINIONS ABOUT THIS ON THE INTERNET BUT AGAIN NOT A LOT OF QUALITY PURE REVIEW DATA NONE THE LESS CISI QUADRANGULARIS HAS BEEN SHOWED NOPOTELY INCREASE SERATONAN IN HUMANS AND FOR PEOPLE THARE SEEKING TO INCREASE ERATONAND MAY BE IN PARTICULAR FORSAKE OF APPETITE AND WEGT CONTROL THAT MIGHT BE A USEFUL COMPOUND I KNOW MANY PEOPLE ALSO TAKE FIVE H T P ONE OF THE PRECURSERS TO SERATONAN INDOSAGES OF ANYWHERE FROM THREE HUNDRED OR FIVE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS TYPICALLY PEOPLE ARE DOING THIS IN ANTICIPATION OF SLEEP MEANING IN THE FINAL HOUR OF WAKEFULNESS BEFORE GOING TO SLEEP I MYSELF HAVE TRIED FIVE H T P PRIOR TO SLEEP AND ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT IT LED TO VERY DEEP SLEEP FOR ABOUT ONE TO THREE HOURS THAN I WOKE UP AND I COULD NOT FALL BACK A SLEEP I RAN THAT EXPERIMENT TWICE BEFORE I DECIDED TO ABANDON FIVE H T P IS A SLEEP AID AND THAT'S WHY I'VE NEVER PUT IT IN TO OUR SLEEP KIT OR AT LEST MY SLEEP KIT AND WHEN I REFER T THE SLEEP KIT IO'M THAT SOMETHING YOU CAN FINED AT HUBERMAN LABDO COMNIS'S ZERO COST RESOURCE RE CAN C BEHAVIORAL TOOLS AND ALSO SUPPLEMENTATION TOOLS THAT CAN INPROVE THE TRANSITION TIME INTO AND THE DEPTH OF SLEEP AND NONE OF THOSE WHORELY ON FIVE H T P SUPPLEMENTATION THAT SAID I KNOW A NUMBER OF PEOPLE USE FIVE H T P SUPPLEMENTATION OUTSIDE OF SLEEP BRISHES A DURING THE DAYTIME TO TRY AND INCREASE SERATONAN AND IT WILL INDEED INCREASE CIRCULATING SERATONAN BUT AGAIN PEOPLE VARY IN THEIR SENSITIVITY TO THESE SORTS OF THINGS SOME PEOPLE MIGHT FIND FOR INSTANCE THAT THREE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF FIVE H T P IS JUST FAR TOO MUCH IT BLUNTS THEIR APPETITE MIGHT EVEN REDUCE SLEBEDO THERE AREN'T A LOT OF VERY WELL CONTROLLED STUDIES LOOKING AT THIS AND SO HAS TO BE FIGURED OUT ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS IF YOU DECIDE TO APPROACH IT AT ALL NOW ONE MOLECULE THAT IVE FOUND TO BE PARTICULARLY INTERESTING ANY USEFUL AND THIS IS ONE THAT I HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT YET ON THIS PODCAST IS  NOCITOL IN PARTICULAR MIO IN OCITAL MIOANOCITAL CAN HAVE THE EFFECT OF INCREASING SERATONAN AND OTHER NERROCHEMICALS BUT PRIMARILY AT LEAS IN TERMS OF THE NEROMODULATORS DISCUSS TO DAY SER TONENT I'VE BEEN TAKING NINE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF MYOINOCITOL EVERY THIRD NIGHT OR SO AS A TEST OF ITS ABILITY TO IMPROVE SLEEP AND I HAVE TO SAY THE DEPTH AN QUALITY OF SLEEP THAT I'VE BEEN OBTAINING ON MYOWN OCITOL IS PRETTY REMARKABLE IN FACT I'VE USED IT ALONE AND INCOMMINATION WITH THE MAGNESIUM THREE IN AE APIGEN AN THEANINES SLEEP KIT THAT I'VE TALKED ABOUT IN THAT'S INCLUDED IN THAT AGAIN ZERO COST KIT THAT'S AVAILABLES OF PEDIAPHON OUR WEBSIGHT SO MYOWNOCITOL IS KNOWN TO INCREASE CIRCULATING LEVELES OF CERETONAN IT HAS BEEN EXPLORED EXTENSIVELY IN BOTH ANIMAL MODELS AND INHUMANS FOR IT'S DAYTIME USE FOR TREATING ANXIETY IT DOES SEEM TO REDUCE ANXIETY AND FOR ALL SORTS OF THINGS IT'S BEEN EXPLORED FOR BY POLAR DISORDER WE'RE GOING TO DO AN EPISODE ABOUT BY POLAR DISORDER COMING UP IT'S BEEN EXPLORED FOR THE TREATMENT OF MY GRAIN IT'S BEEN EXPLORED FOR EIGHTY EIGHT STO IT'S BEEN EXPLORED FOR A HUGE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CONDITIONS OF BRAIN AND BODY AGAIN I'VE BEEN USING THE NINE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF MYOINOCITOL IN THE THIRDY TO SIXTY MINUTES BEFORE SLEEP TO IMPROVE MY SLEEP AND T HAS BEEN DOING THAT VERY DRAMATICALLY ESPECIALLY WHEN I TAKE IT ALONGSIDE THE REST OF THOSE SLEEP KIT SUPPLEMENTS A QUICK NOTE ABOUT MY OWN OCITOL FOR SAKE OF INCREASING CERETONAN IF YOU LOOK AT THE HUMAN STUDIES ON MYOWNOCITOL THAT ARE OUT THERE AND IN PETULARFOCUS ON THE HUMAN STUDIES WHAT YOU'LL FIND IS THAT THE DOSAGES THAT ARE OFTEN USE ARE TREMENDOUSLY HIGH SLIKE FIVE GRAHAMS EIGHT GRAHMS EIGHTEEN GRAHAMS OF MY ONOCITOL TAKEN THROUGHOUT THE DAY I DON'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE STOMACH THAT AND IN FACT MANY PEOPLE DROP OUT OF THOSE STUDIES BECAUSE OF GATER JIST COMFORT AND YET I ALLSO WONDER HOW PEOPLE TOLERATE ET BECAUSE IT HAS SOME ONE OF A SEDITIVE OF FACT AND IT THIS KIND OF ANTI ANXIETY EFFECT AND I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE GIVEN MY EXPERIENCE WITH NINE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS WHAT ONE WOULD EXPERIENCE TAKING MULTIPLE OR MANY MORE GRAHAMS PER DAY SO I CERTAINLY AM NOT ENCOURAGING THAT AND THE ONLY REASON I MENTION MY OWN OCITOL IS THAT IT HAS A NOWN EFFECT OF INCREASING SEROTONAN IT LEAST IN MY EXPERIENCE IT DOES NOT LEAD TO THIS FALLING DEEPLY ASLEEP IN WAKING BACK UP ACTUALLY TO THE CONTRARY IF I WAKE UP IN MILL THE NIGHT TO USE THE BATHROOMWHERE I WAKE UP THE MILINITE FOR WHATEVER OTHER REASON IV FIND IT FAR EASIER TO FALL BACK O SLEEP IF I'VE TAKEN NINE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS IN OCITOL PRIOR TO SLEEP SO FOR ME IT'S PROVING TO BE A QUITE USEFUL COMPOUND I'M NOT AWARE OF HAVING ANY  SERATONURGIC DEFICIONCY OVER ALL DON'T CONCER MYSELF DEPRESSED AND OF COURSE I SHOULD MENTION THAT NO SUPPLEMENT EITHER ADDED OR WITHDRAWN FROM YOUR PROTOCOL SHOULD EVER BE USED AS A DIRECT REPLACEMENT FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUG TREATMENTS THAT YOUR PHYSICION AS GIVEN YOU SHOULD ALWAYS TALKED YOUR PHYSICION ANY TIME YOU REMOVE OR ADD SOMETHING TO YOUR DRUG PROTOCOLAR PRESCRIPTION PROTOCOL OF COURSE SO WE'VE GOT BEHAVIORAL PROTOCOLS THAT AS SOLY'S IT FEELS TO SAY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO POTENTLY INCREASE SERETONAN THINGS LIKE PHYSICAL CONTACT CUDDLING HOLDING HANDS WITH PEOPLE THAT YOU LOVE OF COURSE RIGHT I THINK IF THEY RE EOPLE THAT YOU ON DESPISED IT WOULD HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT FOR OBVIOUS REASONS BUT ALSO RECEIVING GRATITUDE AND OBSERVING GRATITUDE VERY POTENT INCREASES IN CERATONAN AND THINGS LIKE CISIS QUADRANGULARIS THINGS LIKE FIVE H C P MAY HAVE THEIR USES RIGHT THEIR VERY POTENT AT INCREASING CERATONAN BUT THEY DO SEEM TO HAVE THE NEED TO CYCLE THEM AND THEY ARE NEW WANT SOME PEOPLE RESPOND WELL TO THEM OTHER LIKE MYSELF DON'T AND OF COURSE ALWAYS BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR DRAMATIC OR EVEN SUBTLE DECREASES AN APPETITE OR LEBITO OR THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT NOT WANT IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE TINKERING WITH YOUR SERATONURGIC A LEVELS AND PATHWAYS AND THEN MYOR NOCITALL ACTUALLY AS PROVING TO BE QUITE USEFUL TO ME AND WHETHER NOT THAT'S BECAUSE OF ITS EFFECTS ON SERATONAN OR THROUGH SOME OF ITS OTHER EFFECTS ON MAY BE REDUCING ANXIETY WHICH CERTAINLY EXPERIENCE IF I WAKE UP IN THE MILLTHEN I DO DON'T LIKE WA IN WIT THE MILL THE NIGHT BUT ON MY OWN OCITALIS AR SEEM NOT REALLY CARE THAT I WOKE UP HEN I FALL RIGHT BACK ASLEEP SO THE DIRECT SOURCE OF THE PAUSIVE EFFECTS THAT I'M GETTING AREN'T CLEAR BUT NONE LESS I THOUGHT I'D PASS I LONG AS A YUSEFUL TOOL BECAUSE IT IS OUT THERE AND IT IS AVAILBLE OVER THE COUNTER AND PROVIDED YOUR TAKING THE APPROPRIATE SAFETY STEPS IN CONSIDERING WHETHER NOT TO USE IT OR NOT I THINK IT MIGHT BE A USEFUL TOOL AND OF COURSE AS WITH ALL THE OTHER NERMODULATORS WE DISCUSS YOU HAVE BOTH A BASE LINE OF CERATONAN AND THE ABILITY TO GIVE OR PROVIDE YOURSELF PEAKS OF SERATONAN THROUGH THESE VARIOUS PROTOCALLS THE DIETARY INTERVENTIONS OF THE SORT THAT I MENTION MEANING EATING FOODS THAT ARE EN RICH IN TRIP TO FAN THOSE ARE MAINLY GOING TO A JUS YOUR BASELINE LEVELS OF TRIP TOFAN FOR INSTANCE IF YOU REALLY WANT TO BE SLEEPY SURE YOU COULD EAT SOME WHITE MEAT TURKEY IN HOPES TO THAT TRIP TOFAN WILL CONVERT TO CERATONAN AND MAKE YOU SLEEPY ET CETERA BUT IN GENERAL THOSE ARE GINGTO BE PRETTY LONGLASTING EFFECTS ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT NOT ALL OF THE TRIP TOFAN YOU WILL INJEST IS GOING TO BE CONVERTED INTO CERATONAN IN YOUR BRAIN IT'S GOING TO HAVE OTHER EFFECTS ON OTHER TISSUES AN ORGANS OF YOUR BODY NONE THE LESS IF YOU WANT TO INCREAS SERATONAN PROVIDING THE APPROPRIATE BASE LINE CONTECT IS GOING TO BE USEFUL AND AGAIN THIS IS A GENERAL THEME OF ALL FOUR OF THESE NAUROMODULATORS DOPAMIN EPIN EFRAN A SETOCONAN CERATONAN YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE SUFFICIENT BASE LINE LEVELS OF THOSE THINGS THROUGH THINGS LIKE DIET REGULAR BEHAVIORS AND THEN YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE SUPPLEMENTATION AND IF ITS APPROPRIATE FOR YOU PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND CERTAIN BEHAVIORAL PROTICALS TO TRY AND GET THESE PPOTENT INCREASESS ACUTE INCREASES IN WHICHEVER THE NER MODULATORS YOU HAPPEN TO WANT TO LEVERAGE FOR YOUR PARTICULAR GOLLS SO THAT BRINGS US TO THE END OF AT LEAST THIS EXPLORATION OF THE NAURMODULATORS DOPOMINE EPINEPHRAN ACEDOCALLING AND CERATONAN SOME OF YOU WHO ARE REGULAR LISTENERS OF THIS POTCAS MIGHT BE SAYING BUT WE'VE HEARD ALL THIS BEFORE RIGHT YET AN EPISODE ON DOPOMINE YOU HAD AN EPISODE ON ANXIETY YOU HAD AN EPISODE ON SLEEP AND INDEED THAT'S TRUE BUT WHAT I'VE TRIED TO PROVIDE TO DAY IS A FRAMEWORK THAT CUTS THROUGH ALL THOSE EPISODES AND AT THE SAME TIME BUILDS OUT A NEW AND WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE A REALLY IMPORTANT THEME AND PRINCIPLE WHICH IS THAT WHETHER NOT YOUR USING NUTRITIONAL TOOLS OR SUPPLEMENTATION OR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS OR ANY OTHER SORT OF PROTOCAL TO TRY AND CREATE A DESIRED EFFECT OF FOCUS OR ENERGY MOTIVATION RELAXATION YOU ARE PLAYING WITH THE SAME NEUROCHEMICAL INGREDIENTS JUST AS IN THE REALM OF NUTRITION YOU HAVE MACRONUTRIANS YOU APPROACINES COHYDRATES AND FACTS THAT CAN BE ADJUSTED IN DIFFERENT RATIOS AND ARRANGE TO DIFFERENT TIMES IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE CERTAIN DESIRED EFFECTS WELL WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR NEUROCHEMISTRY AND YOUR ABILITY TO PERFORM MENTALLY TO PERFORM PHYSICALLY AND YOUR OVERALL WELL BEING YOU ARE DEALING WITH A SMALL HANDFUL OF ESPECIALLY POTENT MOLECULES AND I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE MANY NEUROMODULATORS THERE INDEED MANY NEUROTRANSMITTORS GLUDOMINE GLICINE GABA ET CETERA BUT TO DAY WE FOCUSED ON THE MAIN FOR MEANING THE MOST POTENT AND MOST WIDESPREAD NEUROMODULATORS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT GIVE YOU ACCESS TO PARTICULAR BRAN STATES AND BODY STATES OF THE SORT THAT MOST PEOPL DESIRE SO WHAT I'M HOPING IS THAT RATHER THAN DECIDE THAT ANY ONE TOOL IS THE MOST USEFUL OR THAT ANY ONE NEUROCHEMICAL IS MOST USEFUL FOR THAT MATTER THAT THE INFORMATION THAT HAVE PROVIDED TODAY ALLOWS YOU A KIT OF VERSATILE TOOLS THAT ALLOWS YOU TO FIGURE OUT WHAT LEVELS OF DOPOMINE AND AUGMENTATION OF DOPOMINE ARE APPROPRIATE AND NECESSARY FOR YOU WHAT LEVELS OF ASEDOCOLINE AND TOOLS FOR MANIPULATING A SITOCOLING ARE GOING TO BE MOST USEFUL FOR YOU AND SO ON AND SO FORTH BECAUSE AT LEAST AT THIS STAGE IN TIME THAT IS JUNE TWENTY TWENTY TWO THERE IS NO SIMPLE AT HOME TEST IN FACT THERE IS NO SIMPLE LABORATORY TEST THAT ALLOWS US TO KNOW WHETHER NOT OUR DOPOMING LEVELS AR HIGH IN OUR CARETONAN LEVELS OR LOW WE CAN LOOK AT SOMEBODY AN THEIR BEHAVIOR WE CAN LOOK AT OURSELVES AN OUR OWN MOOD AND BEHAVIOR AND WE CAN IN FER WHAT THOSE LEVELS MAY OR MAY NOT BE BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE A REALLY GOOD TEST OF DOPOMING LEVELS ARE CERATONAN LEVELS THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO SAY OKE THIS PERSON OR I NEED TO INCREASE DOPOMINE TOFOLD IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE CONOMOTIVATION THAT WE WANT UNFORTUNE THAT DOESN'T EXIST RATHER WE ARE CONFRONTED WITH THE SITUATION WHERE WE UNDERSTAND GENERALLY WHAT THESE DIFFERENT EUROMODULATORS DO THE DIFFERENT MENTAL STATES AND PHYSICAL STATES THAT THEY TEND TO PUT US INTO AND WE REVIEWED THOSE AND WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE REALLY POTENT TOOLS TO ADJUST THOSE NEUROMODULATORS IF NOT ALONE BUT IN CERTAINT COMMINATIONS THAT IS INGESTION OF CAFINE WILL TAPIN TO AND SUPPORT DOPAMING END EPINEFERAN IN NCREASING DOPOMINE AND EPINEFRON A LONG SIDE INCREASING ASEDOCOLING WILL ALLOW US TO ACCESS CERTAIN BRAIN STATES THAT IS FOCUST ALERT ENERGIZE BRAINSTATES GREAT FOR LEARNING AND PLASTICITY OF ALL KINDS WHEREAS AUGMENTING CERETONAN IS GOING TO PUT US INTO MORE RELAXED STATE AND SO ON AND SO FORTH AND I'D LIKE YOU TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THERE IS NO NEGOTIATING THE FACT THAT WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT PHASES OF OUR TWENTY FOR OUR CYCLE DURING WHICH THOSE VERY SAME NUROMODULATORS TEND TO BE NATURALLY HIGHER OR NATURALLY LOWER AND I REVIEW THAT THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE SO MY WISH FOR YOU IS THAT YOU WILL TAKE THIS INFORMATION EXPERIMENT WITH IT AS YOU SEE FIT FOR YOU AND IN A SAFE WAY AND AS YOU GO FORWARD TO REALLY TRYING GAIN INTUITION AND UNDERSTANDING AS TO NOT JUST HOW THESE PROTOCALS WORK BUT HOW ANY PROTOCAL THAT YOU MIGHT ENCOUNTER SUPPLEMENT BASE DRUG BASED BEHAVIORL BASE HOW THOSE MIGHT TAP IN TO THESE DIFFERENT MAJOR NOROMODULATOR SYSTEMS AND FROM THAT TO BE ABLE TO BETTER PREDICT AND AVALUATE WHETHER NOT THEY'RE GOING TO BE USEFUL TO YOU DETRIMENTAL TO YOU OR WHETHER NOT THEY SHOULD BE USED IN COMMINATIONS THAT WOULD BE MORE USEFUL TO YOU IF YOU'RE LEARNING FROM AND OR ENJOYING THIS PODCAST PLEASE SUBSCRIBED OUR U TUBE CHANNEL THAT'S A TERRIFIC ZEROCOST

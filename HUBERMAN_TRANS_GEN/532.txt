WELCOME TO THE HUBERMEN LA PONCAS   SCIENCE SCIENCE PACE TO  FOR   MY NAME IS ANDREW HUBERMEN AND EMA PROFESSOR OF NERBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FOR MY TEACHING IN RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COST TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS AT LETIC GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THE REASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS ON TH REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIGRENS ONCE OR TWICE TO DAY IS THAT IT HELPS ME COVER ALL OF MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGHT HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH OUR VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GOPMICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WITH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSENTIALLY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITHOUT LETIC GREENS IT GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED AND THE PROBIOCS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIOM IF YOU LIKE TO TRY ATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO

ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR AVE TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLL OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLITES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AND ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIUM MAGNESIUM IN POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOS ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY ND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEM CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLITES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IF HYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOUR GETTING THE PROPARATIOES OF ELECTROLITES IF YOU LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMENT DOK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND YOU'LL GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THERE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT A TRY ELEMEN YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEE MENTI DOTCALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO DAY WE'RE TALKING ALL ABOUT EMOTIONS EMOTIONS ARE SENTIAL TO OUR ENTIRE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE WHETHER'RE NOT WE'RE HAPPY OR SAD OR DEPRESSED OR ANGRY IS OUR LIFE EXPERIENCE AND YET I THINK WITH ALL THE IMPORTANCE THAT WE'VE PLACED ON EMOTIONS VERY FEW PEOPLE ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND HOW EMOTIONS ARISE IN OUR BRAIN AND BODY AND I MENTION BRAIN AND BODY BECAUSE AS YOU'LL SEE TO DAY EMOTIONS REALLY CAPTURE THE BRAIN BODY RELATIONSHIP WE CANNOT SAY THAT EMOTIONS ARISE JUST FROM WHAT HAPPENS IN OUR HEAD IT ALSO INVOLVES EVENTS BIOLOGICAL EVENTS CHEMICAL EVENTS WITHIN OUR BODY THE OTHER THING ABOUT EMOTIONS IS THAT THERE'S NO REAL AGREEMENT AS TO WHAT'S A GOOD EMOTION ORE A BAD EMOTION TO DAY WE'RE GING TO TALK ABOUT THE BIOLOGY OF THE CHEMICALS AND PATHWAYS THAT GIVE RISE TO EMOTIONS AND I'M GOING TO EQUIP YOU WITH SEVERAL IF NOT MANY TOOLS THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO REGULATE AND CHANGE AND STERIOR EMOTIONS SHOULD YOU WANT BUT NOT USING THE TYPICAL ADVICE YOU KNOW EVERYONE'S PROBABLY HEARD OF THIS THING OH YOU KNOW IF YOUR FEELING DEPRESSED JUST SMILE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU ETS IMPOSSIBLE BE DEPRESSED WHILE SMILING LOOK IF THAT WE'RE TRUE WE WOULDN'T HAVE ANY DEPRESSED PEOPLE BECAUSE DEPRESS PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO BE DEPRESSED AND IT IS NOT THE CASE THAT SIMPLY SMILING WILL REVERSE DEPRESSION OR SADNESS AND IT'S SIMPLY NOT THE CASE THAT SMILING CAN INHIBIT SADNESS IT JUST DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY HOWEVER IT IS THE CASE THAT CERTAIN THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN OUR BODY INFLUENCE HOW OUR BRAIN FUNCTIONS AND THE CHEMICALS THAT ARE RELEASED AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK A LOT ABOUT HOW THE BRAIN AMBODY INTO RACT TO CREATE THESE THINGS CALLED EMOTIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF FOOD AND NUTRITION AND THE REASON WE'RE DOING THAT IS NOT BECAUSE I AVE IN BEATING THE DRUM ABOUT PARTICULAR DIET REGIMENTS OR ANYTHING IN FACT OR NO CAN DO ANY OF THAT WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS I'M GOING TO REVIEW SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SCIENTIFIC DATA THAT POINT TO HOW INGESTING CERTAIN NUTRIENCE BOTH MACRONUTRANTE LIKE PROTINES FATS AND CARBOHYDRATES AS WELL AS MICRONUTRIENCE CAN IMPACT THE CHEMICALS IN OUR BRAIN THAT GIVE RISE TO THE FEELINGS OF BEING HAPPY OR SAD OR SLEEPY OR ALERT WHEN YOU WANT TO BE SLEEPY OR SLEEPY WHEN YOU WANT TO BE ALERT SO THIS IS SURE TO BE A BROAD DISCUSSION AND YET WE'RE GOING TO GET VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT EMOTIONS ARE HOW THEY ARISE IN THE BODY TOOLS THAT ONE CAN USE IN ORDER TO BHAT TERE CONTROL THEIR EMOTIONS TOOLS THAT PEOPLE CAN USE TO BELIEVE IT ARE NOT FEEL HAPPIER OR FEEL CALMER AND THAT'S BECAUSE IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS OR SO THERE'S BEEN AN EXPLOSION OF SCIENTIFIC STUDIES EXPLORING HOW THE BRAIN AMDBODY INTERACT TO SUPPORT CERTAIN NARROW CHEMICALS THAT GIVE US THESE FEELINGS OF BEING ALERT AND HAPPY OR DEPRESSED OR CERTAIN THAT OUR LIFE IS GAN O BE TERRIBLE OR CERTAIN THAT OUR LIFE IS GOING TO BE GREAT SO AS MYSTERIOUS IS ALL THAT MIGHT SOUND AND CONFUSING AS ALL THAT MIGHT SOUND WERE GONTO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR TO DAY AND YOU'RE GOING TO COME AWAY FROM THIS CONVERSATION WITH A LOT OF TOOL OLS THAT YOU CAN ACT ON IMMEDIATELY AND THOSE TOOLS ARE GROUNDED IN SCIENTIFIC DATA WE ARE GOIN TO PROVIDE LINKS TO SEVERAL OF THE STUDIES AND OF AN IMENSION SOME A SEVERAL OF THOSE STUDIES AS WE GO ALONG BUT OVER ALL THE GOL TO DAY IS FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND HOW MOODS IN EMOTIONS ARISE AND THET DIFFERENT PATHWAYS IN YOUR BRAIN ENBODY THAT ALLOW THEM TO HAPPEN AND HOW YOU CAN USE THOSE PATHWAYS TO CHANGE THOSE EMOTIONS AND THE TOOLS THAT YOU CAN RELY ON IN VERY SPECIFIC WAYS TO SHIFT FROM BEING SAY SLIGHTLY DEPRESSED O FEELING HAPPIER THERE ACTUALLY ARWAYS TO DO THAT OR FROM FEELING TOO ALERT AND ANXIOUS TO FEELING CALMER AND THESE ARE TOOLS THAT ARE DISTINCT FROM THE TOOLS I'VE TALKED ABOUT IN PREVIOUS EPISODES THE DISCUSSION AROUND EMOTIONS HAS A LONG AND RICH HISTORY GOING BACK TO DARWIN AND EVEN LONG BEFORE DARWIN NOW THIS IS A CONVERSATION THAT PHILOSOPHERS AND SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN HAVING FOR HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF YEARS YON THE THE IDEA THAT DARWIN PUT FORTH AND THAT WAS REALLY ATTRACTIVE FOR ABOUT THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS WAS THAT EMOTIONS ARE UNIVERSAL AND THAT SOME OF THE FACIAL EXPRESSIONS AROUND EMOTION ARE UNIVERSAL AND OTHER PEOPLE HAVE YOU KNOW CAPITALIZED ON THAT IDEA AND TO SOME EXTENT IT'S TRUE I MAN I THINK THAT THEY TOO MOST ROBUST EXAMPLES OF THAT WOULD BE WHEN WE SEE SOMETHING OR WE SMELL SOMETHING OR WE TASTE SOMETHING THAT WE LIKE THERE DOES TEND TO BE A POSTURAL LEANING IN WE TEND TO INHALE ERE AT THAT TIME WE TAN TO BRING IN MORE OF WHATEVER CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE IS THEIRS WE TEND TO THESE MUMS AND YOU KNOW IN KIND OF LEAN IN CLOSER TO THINGS THAT ARE ATTRACTIVE TO US AND WHEN WE SEE AND EXPERIENCE THINGS THAT WE DON'T LIKE SOMETIMES IT'S A MILD AVERSION WE JUST CINE TO LEAN BACK OR LOOK AWAY OTHER TIMES IT'S AN INTENSE AVERSION OF DISGUST AND WE TEND TO CRINGE OUR FACE WE TEND TO AVOID INHALING ANY OF THE CHEMICALS THIS PROBABLY HAS ROOTS IN ANCIENT BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS THAT ARE TO PREVENT US FROM INGESTING THINGS THAT ARE BAD FOR US CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS AND TASTE THAT MIGHT BE POISONOUS SO MUCH OF THE FOUNDATION OF ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT EMOTION HAS TO CENTER AROUND THIS KIND OF PUSHPULL OF ATTRACTION TO THINGS OR AVERSION FROM THINGS NOW THAT'S A VERY BASIC WAY OF THINKING ABOUT EMOTIONS BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IT WORKS FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES AND IN THE BRAIN EVERYWHERE FROM THE DEEP CIRCUITS OF THE BRAIN TO THE MAR AND F WHAT WE CALL HIGHER ORDER REVOLVE CENTERS OF THE BRAIN WE HAVE THIS PUSHPULL THING WERE EITHER  PREVIOUS EPISODE IVE TALKED ABOUT GO THE CIRCUITS THAT ALLOW YOU TO EMPHASIZE ACTION AND THEN NO GO CIRCUITS THE CIRCUITS IN THE BASEL GANGLIA THAT ALLOW YOU TO DE EMPHASIZE ACTION PREVENT ACTION WE TALK ABW THAT'S A PUSHPULL SO AVERSION AND ATTRACTION IS A PUSHPULL TOO DELIGHT OR HAPPINESS OR EXCITEMENT ARE ATTRACTIONS TO CERTAIN THINGS AND IDEAS SONGS PEOPLE PLACES FOODS AVERSION IS A LEANING OUT IT'S A DISGUST ITS AN AVOIDANCE AND SO WE CAN BREAK DOWN THE DISCUSSION ABOUT EMOTIONS INTO THE SIMPLER VERSIONS OF THEMSELVES BUT AT THE CORE OF THAT OF ATTRACTION OR AVERSION IS AN IMPORTANT THEME THAT YOU MIGHT REALIZE ALREADY BUT MOST PEOPLE TEND OVERLOOK WHICH IS THAT THERE'S AN ACTION THERE YOU'RE EITHERE MOVING FORWARD OR YOU'RE MOVING AWAY FROM SOMETHING AND ANY TIMEYOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ACTION IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MOTOR BEHAVIORS YOURE TALKING ABOUT LITERALLY THE CONTRACTION OF MUSCLES TO MOVE YOU TOWARD OR AWAY FRORM THINGS AND ANY TIME YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT NERVE TO MUSCLE AND ACTION YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE BRAIN AND THE BODY BECAUSE THE BRAIN CAN'T MOVE ITSELF THE BRAIN HAS A BODY SO THAT THE ORGANISM CAN MOVE AND THE BODY HAS A BRAIN SO THAT THE ORGANISM YOU CAN MOVE TOWARD OR AWAY FROM THINGS THAT YOU DEEM TO BE GOOD OR BAD FOR YOU NOW SOME OF THESE THINGS THAT WERE ATTRACTED TO IN SOME OF THEM THAT WE AVOID OR WHAT WE CALL INNATE OR HARD WIRED YET WHEN WE TASTE THE BITTER COMPOUNDS A'RE NOTHIN ABOUT BITTER LIKE A YOU LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF A BITTERS IN YOUR DRINK ORE SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT REALLY BITTER COMPOUNDS WE TEND TO AVOID THOSE BECAUSE THEIR ASSOCIATED WITH POISONS WHEN WE TASTE THINGS THAT ARE SWEET OR THAT ARE SAVORY WE TEND TO LE PURSUE MORE OF THOSE WE TEND TO LEAN TOWARD THOSE SO TO SPEAK AND WE TEND TO NOT AVOID THEM SO THERE ARE CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN FOR A FOR AVERSION AND FOR ATTRACTION TOWARD THINGS AND THE BODY IS GOVERNING A LOT OF THAT AND SO IMMEDIATELY IN THIS CONVERSATION I WANT TO RAISE AN IMPORTANT POINT WHICH IS ABOUT A NERVE PATHWAY THAT MANY MANY PEOPLE HAVE HEARD OF THAT GETS DISCUSSED ALL THE TIME AND THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST KIND OF OVERSOLD FOR THE WRONG REASONS AND UNDERSOLD UNFORTUNATELY FOR ITS REAL POWER WHICH IS THE VAGUEST NERVE SO THE VAGUEST NERVE IS ONE NOT THE ONLY BUT ONE WAY IN WHICH OUR BRAIN AND BODY ARE CONNECTED AND REGULATES OUR MOTIONAL STATES NOW MANY OF YOU HAVE PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT POLLY VAGAL THEORY I'M GOING TALK ABOUT THIS TO DAY POLLYVAGAL THEORY WAS IAM POPULARIZED BY STEVEN PORGUS AND IT'S AN INTERESTING THEORY CERTAIN ASPECTS OF IT FRANKLY HOLD UP TO THE SCIENCE SOME OF IT DOESN'T AND O'MEN AN DISCUSS ALL OF THAT TO DAY A LOT OF THE VAGUES AND THE EXCITEMENT ABOUT THE VAGUUS V A G U S IS BECAUSE IT SOMEHOW GOT INTO THE MIND OF THE PUBLIC THAT THE VAGUUS IS INVOLVED IN CALMING US DOWN SO WHAT IS THE VAUST NERVE OK WE CAN TO MAKE THIS REALLY SIMPLE TA PARTICULAR FOR THOSE THY ARE JUST LISTENING YOU CAN JUST OMACTION THIS FOR THOSE EITHER WATCHING I'LL POINT TO THE VARIOUS ARIAS BUT VASICALLY VAGUEST IS THE TENTH CRANIAL NERVE WHICH BASY MEANS THAT THE NURONS THE THE KIND OF THE THE CONTROL CENTRE OF EACH OF THOSE NURONS IN THE VAGUS LIVES JUST KIND OF NEAR THE NECK I AND A BRANCH OF THE VAGUUS GOES INTO THE BRAIN THEY SENDLE A WIRE INTO THE BRAIN THE OTHER BRANCH GOES INTO THE PERIFERY BUT NOT JUST THE GUT GOES INTO THE STOMACH THE INTESTINS THE HEART THE LUNGS AND THE IMMUNE SYSTEM SO THAT THIS VAGUUS NERVOUS INCREDIBLE BECAUSE IT'S TAKING INFORMATION FROM THE BODY AND IT HAS TWO DIRECTIONS THE FIRST IS WHAT WE CALL CENSORY SO IT'S SENSING THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN THE GUT IN THE LUNGS EVERYTHING FOR EXAMPLE IN THE LUNGS WHEN OUR LUNGS ARE DISTENDED THE VAGUES NERVE SENSES THAT AND SENS THAT INFORMATION UPEN TO THE BRAIN IT ALSO CONSENSE THINGS IN THE GUT LIKE HOW DISTENDED OR EMPTY YOUR STOMACH HAPPENS TO BE IT CAN SENSE HEARTRIGHT IT CONSENSE YOUR IMUNE SYSTEM WHETHER NOT YOU HAVE BACTERIO OR THINGS INVADING YOU IN YOUR BODY SO IT SENSE THAT INFORMATION UP TO THE BRAIN SO IT'S A TWO WAY STREET AND SENSORY INFORMATION IS GOING UP TO THE BRAIN THAT'S ALL VAGUUS SOYS LIKE A SUPER HIGHWAY SENSORY INFORMATION GOING ONE WAY AND IN THE OTHER DIRECTION IS MOTOR CONTROL SO THE VAGUUS IS NOT JUST FOR SENSING THINGS IT'S ACTALLY FOR CONTROLLING THINGS IS GOT A SENSORY PATHWAY AND A MOTOR PATHWAY STHAT'S THE FIRST THING I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THE VAGUS IN FACT IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT I FEEL LIKE THIS IS AS IMPORTANT IS PEOPLE KNOWING THAT WALKING INVOLVES FLEXORS AND EXTENSORS AND IF YOU DON'T THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT IT'S AS IMPORTANT AS WALKING FRANKLY BECAUSE THE VAGUS IS THE WAY IN WHICH YOU CAN GOVERN THE BRAIN BODY CONNECTION AND IN WHICH YOU CAN STEER VARIOUS ASPECTS OF YOUR MOOD AND WELL BEING BUT MOST PEOPLE JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE IT SO FIRST YOU GOT UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS SO YO'VE GOT CENSORY INFORMATION COMING FROM ALL THESE DIFFERENT ORGANS OF THE BODY UP TO THE BRAIN GET MOTOR INFORMATION GOING FROM THE BRAIN BACK TO THE BODY AND SWEO'VE GOT THE SUPERHIGHWAY WITHIN YOU NOW WHAT ACTUALLY REGULATES THE VAGUS OFTENTIMES YOU'LL HERE THINGS LIKE OH YOU KNOW THIS PARTICULAR BEHAVIOR YOU KNOW RUBBING IT A YOUR FACE AT A PARTICULAR LOCATION OR BREATHING IN A PARTICULAR WAY OR AH YOU'LL WARM BATH OR SOMETHING STIMULATES THE VAGUS WELL RIGHT NOW I WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW THAT QUOTEN QUOTE STIMULATING THE VAGUS BROADLY SPEAKING IS A TERRIBLE WAT TO THINK ABOUT THE VAGUS BECAUSE DID YOU KNOW WHAT IF YOU HAVE A CONTAMINANT INSIDE YOUR BODY THE VAGUEST SENSE IS THAT AND PROJECTS THAT INFORMATION TO YOUR BRAIN AND YOU START TO GENERATE A FEVER YOU START TO TRY AND KILL THAT CONTAMINANT IN YOUR BODY SO I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU WANT A STIMULATE THE VAGUUS JUST AS A GENERAL THEME TO DAY ORE GON TO GET SPECIFIC ABOUT HOW YOU CAN ACTIVATE PARTICULAR CIRCUITS SCERTAIN PATHWAYS FROM CERTAIN ORGANS TO THE BRAIN IN ORDER TO FEEL BETTER OR RELIEVE CERTAIN CONDITIONS BUT YOU CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO JUST STIMULATE THE VAGUS NOW EXCITEMENT ABOUT THE VAGUS IN PART IS BECAUSE OF WHAT A QUITE HONESTLY WAS IT FAIRLY PIONEERING THEORY ABOUT THE VAGUS WHICH IS POULY VAGEL THEORY SO POLLY VAGEL THE WORD POLLY MEANS MANY IS COOL BECAUSE IT ECKNOWLEDGE IS THAT THE VAGUUS HAS A LOT OF DIFFERENT BRANCHES IT'S NOT JUST ONE THING AND SO I REALLY LIKE THAT I LIKE THE NAMING POULY VAGEL THE IDEA THAT PORTUS PUT FORWARD WAS THAT THERE'S A DOOR SOUL VAGUS A WHICH HIS KONOFON RUNS THE BACK OF THE SPINAL CORD WHICH IS INVOLVED IN ALERTNESS AND ACTIVATION AND KIND OF FIGHT ER FLIGHT TYPED STUFF AND THAT THERE'S A VENTUAL PATHWAY AND THAT THAT'S INVOLVED IN MORE KIND OF EMPATHIC BEHAVIORS THAT IS NOT QUITE IN AGREEMENT WITH THE MODERN ANATOMY BUT YOU KNOW HE WAS DOING THE BEST WITH WHAT HE HAD AT THE TIME SO OKE THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THE POLY VAGUAL THEORY IS THE WAY THAT IT'S DISGUSSED PEOPLE OFTEN SAY OH YOU KNOW IF YOUR DORSO VGUUS IS A TOO ACTIVE THAN YOU TEN TO BE SOME ONE WHO'S LITTLE TOO KEED UP AND PEOPLE WHO ARE KIND OF IN A STATE OF FREEZE OR OR KIND OF FLACID AND KIND OF YOU KNOW LIKE JUST NOT REALLY ON ACTIVE AND AND THEI'RE JUST LEPHARGIC WELL THEN THAT PATHWAY IS HYPOACTIVE IT SHOULD BE MORE ACTIVE SO T ALOT OF THEORIES ABOUT HOW PSYCHOLOGY MAPS ON TO THE VAGUUST THAT AS FAR AS I KNOW DON'T MAPTO ANY REAL PHYSIOLOGY NOW THE OTHER PROBLEM WITH THIS KIND OF THE WAY THAT THE POLY VAGAL THEORY IS DISCUSSED PROBABLY NOT BY THE REAL EXPERTS BUT BY A LOT OF PEOPLE IS THET PEOPLE START TO DIGNOST DIFFERENT PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL MANIFESTATIONS THROUGH THE VAGUUS THEY WOULD SAY THINGS LIKE OH YOU KNOW THIS PERSON IS HYPERFLEXIBLE AT THE JOINTS AND THEREFORE THEIR DORSO VAGUUST ISN'T ACTIVE OR NOG FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND IT'S REALLY KIND OF GONE WAY OUTSIDE THE LANE LINES SO TO DAY WEREGIN TO CLEAN UP A LOT OF THAT LET'S MAKE IT REALLY SIMPLE ABOUT HOW THE VAGUUST ACTUALLY WORKS AT LEAST AS WE UNDERSTAND IT TO DAY IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE FIRST OF ALL AS I MENTION YOU HAVE CENSORY INFORMATION THE SAME WAY TAT YOU DETECT LIGHT WITH YOUR EYES OR YOU HEAR SOUNDS WITH YOUR EARS YOU HAVE CENSORS IN YOUR GUT THAT SENDS HOW FULL OR EMPTY YOUR GOT IS IT CAN ALSO SENDS HOW ACITIC YOUR GOT IS IT CONSENTS VERIEST THINGS WITHIN YOUR GOT YOUR HEART IS DOING THE SAME IT'S INFORMING THE BRAIN HOW FAST YOUR HEART IS BEATING HOW FULL YOUR LUNGS ARE AS BEEN  COMMUNICATED AND THEN THE STATUS OF YOURMIAN SYSTEM SO THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THE VAGUUST IS THE SAME WAY I WOULDTHING ABOUT THE EYES THE EYES ARE LOOKING AT COLORS THAT LOOKING AT MOTION THA LOOKING HOW BRIGHT IT IS AND EACH ONE OF THOSE THINGS THOSE FEATURES IS TELLING THE BRAIN SOMETHING DIFFERENCE OF THE BRAIN CAN DECIDE WHEN TO BE AWAKE OR SLEEP WHETHER NOT IT'S LOOKING AT SOMEBODY ATTRACTIVE OR UNATTRACTIVE THE VAGUEST NERVE IS ALSO ANALYZING MANY FEATURES WITHIN THE BODY AND IN FORMING THE BRAIN OF HOW TO FEEL ABOUT THAT AND WHAT TO DO SO A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE THAT I THINK ITS AN EXCITING ONE IS AS IT RELATES TO SUGAR SO WE ALL KNOW THAT SWEET THINGS GENERALLY TASTES GOOD I'M NOT PARTICULARLY A FAN OF VERY SWEET THINGS YOU KNOW I'D MUCH RATHER HAVE U YOU KNOW CHEESE OR PETZAOR OR HAMBERDOR STAKE I LIKE SAVORY FATTY FOODS BUT I DO LIKE SWEET FOODS AND MOST PEOPLE FIND SWEET FOODS TO BE ATTRACTIVE THEY WANT THEM THEY MIGHT OR THEY MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO REGULATE THEIR BEHAVIOR AROUND THEM BUT THEY WANT THEM AND WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING IS THAT FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS PEOPLE OF THOUGHT THAT THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT SWEET TO SWEET FOODS TASTE SO THEM MAKE SENSE RIGHT YOU EAT SOMETHING IT TASTE SWEET YOU WANT MORE OF IT WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT IT'S MUCH MORE INTERESTING THAN THAT WHEN YOU EAT SOMETHING SWEET WITHIN YOUR STOMACH YOU HAVE CELLS NURONS THAT SENSE THE PRESENCE OF SUGARY FOODS INDEPENDENT OF THEIR TASTE AND SIGNAL TO THE BRAIN SO THOSE SENSORS THOSE NURONS SEND INFORMATION UP THE VAGUS TO YOUR BRAIN GOES THROUGH A SERIES OF STATIONS AND THEN YOU RELEASE DOPEMING THIS MOLECULE THAT MAKES YOU WANT MORE OF WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU JUST INJESTED IN FACT THIS PATHWAYIS SO POWERFUL THAT THEY'VE DONE EXPERIMENTS WHERE THEY COMPLETELY NUMB ALL THE TASTE AND FEELING IN SOMEBODY'S MOUTH THEY'RE BLINDFOLDED SO THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR EATING AND THEY'R EATING OF FOOD THAT'S EITHER SUGARY OR NOT SUGARY AND WHAT THEY FIND IS THAT EVEN THOUGH PEOPLE CAN'T TASTE THE SUGARY FOOD THEY CRAVE MORE OF THE FOOD THAT CONTAIN SUGAR BECAUSE OF THE CENSORS IN THE GUT THAT SENSE SUGAR SO TO PUT THIS DIFFERENTLY YOU ACTUALLY HAVE CENSORS WITHIN YOUR BODY THAT MAKE YOU CRAVE SUGAR INDEPENDENT OF THE SWEET TASTE OF THOSE THINGS NOW THAT'S INCREDIBLE AND WHAT IT DOES AND WHAT IT TELLS US IS THAT WE HAVE CIRCUITS IN OUR BODY THAT ARE DRIVING US TOWARDS CERTAIN BEHAVIORS AND MAKING US FEEL GOOD EVEN THOUGH WE CAN'T PERCEIVE THEM NOW FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN GUT INTUITION AND KIND OF GUT FEELINGS THIS IS A GUT FEELING EXCEPT THIS IS A CHEMICAL GUT FEELING THIS IS A PARTICULAR SET OF NURONS DETECTING THAT SOMETHING IN YOUR BODY HAS A PARTICULAR FEATURE IN THIS CASE THE PRESENCE OF SUGARS AND SENDING INFORMATION TO THE BRAIN TO ESSENTIALLY TO CONTROL YOUR BEHAVIOR AND I FIND THIS REMARKABLE BECAUSE WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT WHAT WE CALL ATTRACTIVE ISN'T ALWAYS COMING FROM OUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT OR OUR FEELINGS ARE EVEN OUR PERCEPTION WE ARE DRAWN TO PARTICULAR FOODS AND WERE DRAWN TO PERHAPS ALSO TO PARTICULAR PEOPLE PLACES AND OTHER THINGS BECAUSE OF INFORMATION THAT'S COMING FROM OUR BODY AND WE'EGIN TO TALK ABOUT ONE WHAT ONE CAN DO WITH THIS INFORMATION I KNOW MANY PEOPLE ARE THOUGHTFUL OR CONCERNE ABOUT SUGARS THESE DAYS THINKING YOU KNOW WE ALL IN JUST TOO MUCH SUGAR THEIR SUGAR SNUCK INTO ALL THE THINGS WE A WE EAT AND INDEED THAT'S TRUE I MEAN THIS SHOULD COMPLETELY REFRAME THE WAY THAT WE THINK ABOUT THET SORTER SO CALLED HIDDEN SUGARS IN FOODS WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT EVEN IF A FOOD IS VERY SAVORY LIKE A PIECE OF PETZA OR OR PIECE OF BREAD OR AH EVEN LIKE A SALAD DRESSING IF THEIRE SUGAR SNUCK IN TO THAT AND YOU CAN'T TASTE IT YOU WILL STILL CRAVE MORE OF THAT THING WITHOUT KNOWING THAT YOU CRAVE IT BECAUSE IT HAS SUGAR IN OTHER WORDS YOU MIGHT FIND YOURSELF WANTING CERTAIN FOODS AND NOT KNOWING WHY YOU WANT THOSE FOODS SO I FIND THIS TO BE A FASCINATING ASPECT OF OUR BIOLOGY AND YES IT RELATES TO MOOD IN EMOTION AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT HOW THAT IS IN A MOMENT SO LIT'S JUST BACK UP A BIT AND ASK THE QUESTION WHY DO WE EAT CERTAIN THINGS AND WHY DO CERTAIN FOODS MAKE US FEEL GOOD AND OTHER FOODS ACTUALLY MAKE US FEEL ANXIOUS THINK SOME PEOPLE MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH THIS OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT NOT BUT MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT AS YOU APPROACH EATING THERE'S AN ANXIETY ASSOCIATED WITH THAT IT'S AN ALERTNESS REMEMBER IN THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSIONS OR EVEN IF YOU DON'T AND YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THOSE ALL OF YOUR MOODS AND FEELINGS ARE WELL BEING ARE ANCHORED ON THIS CONTINUUM OF ALERTNESS VERSES CALMNESS AND WE HERE SO OFTEN ABOUT REST IN DIGEST YOU KNOW THAT OH AFTER WE EAT WE FEEL REALLY NICE AND FULL HOPEFULLY COMFORTABLY FULL AND NOT TOOFULL AND WHAT RELAXING AND WE FEEL A SATIATED IT'S ASSOCIATE WITH SIR ATONE IN THIS MOLECULE OF SATIATION THAT'S ALL TRUE BUT WHAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW IS THAT THERE'S AN AREA OF THE HYPOTHALMU SO DEEP IN THE BRAIN KIND IN THE MIDDLE DEEP PORTION OF THE BRAIN CALLED THE LATERAL HYPOTHALMUS AND THE LATERL HYPOTHALMUS IS REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE IT CONTROLS FEEDING BUT IT INHIBITS FEEDING IT IT STOPS US FROM FEEDING AND THERE'S ANOTHER AREA IN THE BRAIN IF YOU WANT NAMES I'LL GIVE THEM TO YOU IF YOU DON'T WANT NAMES JUST IGNORE THEM TO LEAT THEM FROM YOUR FROM YOUR MEMORY AN AWARENESS CALLED THE LOCUS SERULIUS NOW THE LOCUS SERULIUS SITS BACK FURTHER IN THE BRAINSTEM AND IT RELEASES NOR UP IN EFFERON WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY ADRENALINE AND MAKES US FEEL ALERT NOW LOCUS RULIS HAS A LOT OF DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS IN THE BRAIN BUT WHEN WE ARE GOING TO EAT LETS IT WE WALK INTO A RESTAURANT WE SIT DOWN OR WERE PREPARING A MEAL LOCUS SERULIUS IS KNOWN TO RELEASE NOR GRENTALINE IN THE BRAIN IT'S CREATING A KIND OF ALERTNESS THESE HAS ANCIENT UTILITY BUT IT'S CREATING THIS ALERTNESS AND FOR MANY PEOPLE THY EXPERIENCE THAT AS THEY APPROACH FOOD AS STRESS AS ANXIETY BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT AS WE APPROACH FOOD LOCUS SERULIUS AS RELEASING ALL THESE MOLECULES THAT MAKE US FEEL MORE ANXIOUS IN ALERT SOMETIMES IT'S FELT IS EXCITEMENT AND THAT ASK PROBABLY TO DO WITH HOW WE FEEL ABOUT FOOD GENERALLY ARE WE HAPPY WITH OUR RELATIONSHIP TO FOOD ORE WE TRY TO RESTRICT OUR RELATIONSHIP TO FOOD ORE PEOPLE COMING OVER FOR DINNER ALL THAT WILL PLAY IN OF COURSE BUT THERE'S A CERTAIN STRESS AND ANXIETY ON APPROACH TO FOOD AND AS WE APPROACH FOOD AND WE FEEL THAT ANXIETY LOCUS SERULIUS ACTIVATES THE LATERAL HYPOTHALEMUS IN A WAY THAT INHIBITS FEEDING THAT MAKES US NOT WANT TO EAT SO A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE KIND OF PREMIAL ANXIETY OR ANXIETY AROUND FOOD AND THEY CAN'T SEEM TO JUST CALM DOWN AND HOW A GOOD MEAL TO ACS US THAT LATER REST IN DIGEST A LOT OF THAT IS BECAUSE OF THIS HEIGHTENED STRESS UPON APPROACH TO FOOD AND A LOT OF THE TOOLS THAT ARE OUT THERE BOTH FOR EATING DISORDERS AND FOR JUST KOND OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC WHO ISN'T SUFFERING FROM EATING DISORDERS THINGS LIKE MINDFULNESS AROUND MEALS YOU KNOW THEY ALWAYS TELL YOU YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD NEVER EAT WHEN STRESSED I'M SORRY BUT MY LIFE IS NOT ORGANIZE IN A WAY THAT I CAN'T DO THAT WOULD NEVER EAT RIGHT BECAUSE I EAT WHEN I'M AWAKE AND I'M I DON'T KNOW IF I'M STRESS BUT I I DON'T THINK I AM BUT I TEND TO YOU'LL RUN AROUND A LOT DURING THE DAY I DON'T GENERALLY TAKE TIME TO DO TWO OR THREE DEEP BREASTS BEFORE I EAT DIGENERALLY WILL JUST KEEP WILL EAT THAT CAN BE HEALTHIER UNHEALTHY DEPENDING ON THE QUALITY OF OF YOUR DIGESTION I THINK USING DIGESTION AS A GUIDE IS GOOD BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE AREN'T AWARE THAT THE THIS INNERACTION BETWEEN LOCUS TERULIUS AND LATERAL HYPOTHELEMAS IS A BASIC MECHANISM WHERE WE ARE SUPPOSED TO GET A LITTLE BIT ALERT AND ANXIOUS AROUND MEAL TIME AND THEN AS WE EAT THE MECHANISMS FOR CALMING AND SATIATION ARE SUPPOSED TO KICK IN AND THOSE MECHANISMS INVOLVE AS I MENTION EARLY OR TWO THINGS ONE IS HOW THINGS TASTE DIGESTION STARTS IN THE MOUTH OF COURSE WERE TASTE OUR FOOD EVERYONE TELLS US WE SHOULD CHEW OUR FOOD MORE YES THAT CAN IMPROVE DIGESTION WERE NOT SUPOSE TO DRINK TOO MANY FLUIDS AS WE EAT THAT'S TRUE TOO BUT A LOT OF HOW WE FEEL WHILE WE EAT AND AFTER WE EAT IS BECAUSE OF THIS VAGUEST SENSING OF WHAT'S IN OUR GOT IT'S SENDING INFORMATION ALL THE TIME IS THEIR SUGAR ARE THEIR FATS ARE THEIR CONTAMINANTS THERE ARE A LOT OF INFORMATION THESE SO CALL PARALLEL PATHWAYS THAT ARE GOING UP INTO OUR BRAIN THAT REGULATE WHETHER NOT WE WANT TO EAT MORE OF SOMETHING OR NOT AND THERE ARE ECCELERATORS THINGS THAT MAKE US ONE EAT MORE LIKE SUGAR AND FATS BECAUSE THOSE ARE NEUTRIANT DENTS AND THEY HELPS GENERALLY AT LEAST IN THE SHORT TERMS SUPPORT THE SURVIVAL OF ANIMALS BUT ALSO A MENO ACIDS AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT THERE'RE A LOT OF DATA BUT MUCH OF WHAT COMES FROM THE DATA ON WHAT PEOPLE EAT AND HOW MUCH THEY EAT IS FROM A SUBCONSCIOUS DETECTION OF HOW MANY A MENO ACIDS AND WHAT THE ARRAY MEANING THE CONSTELLATION OF AMENO ACIDS IS IN A GIVEN FOOD AND IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THE SOME TOTAL OF THESE STUDIES POINT IN A DIRECTION WHERE PEOPLE WILL BASICALLY EAT NOT UNTIL THEIR STOMACH IS FULL BUT UNTIL THE BRAIN PERCEIVES THAT THEY HAVE ADEQUATE IN TAKE OF A MENO ACIDS NOW THIS IS A CONVERSATION THAT COMES UP IN THE CONTECT OF YOU KNOW THE MEAT ONLY THE QUITO THE KIND OF AZON DIEAT THE MEDITERRANEAN DIE AT THE VIGAN DIET I'M LARGELY GOING TO IGNORE THE KIND OF STRICT CAMPS TO DAY I WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT BECAUSE I THINK EACH ONE OF THEM ACTUALLY TAPS INTO SOMETHING IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS BRAINBODY RELATIONSHIP THAT THE OTHER ONES DON'T BUT I DO'T WAN TO GET INTO A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE ETHIC THE ETHICS OF DIFFERENT FOODS OF ANIMAL BASTE OR NON ANIMAL BASE POSSEST NOT THE TOPIC TO DAY IT'S REALLY ABOUT NEUTRIAN SENSING AND A MENO ACID SENSING SO WE GENERALLY WILL EAT UNTIL OUR GOT TELLS OUR BRAIN THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATE AMOUNTS OF THESE A MENO ACIDS A MENOACIDS OF COURSE ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF SURE MUSCLE AND THE OTHER THINGS IN OUR BODY THAT NEED REPAIR BUT WHAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALI S IS THAT A MENO ACIDS ARE WHAT THE NERROCHEMICLES IN THE BRAIN ARE MADE FROM THIS IS VITALLY IMPORTANT HOCIST SO WE'VE HEARD DOPAMINE IS TAS MOLECULE THAT MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD ACTUALLY DOPAMINE IS A MOLECULE THAT MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD IT'S RELEASED WITHIN THE BRAIN AND IT DOES FEEL G VERY GOOD WHEN YOU HAVE DOPAMINE RELEASE DOPAMIN RELEASE IS CAUSE BY SURPRISE EXCITEMENT EVENTS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO AND THAT TURN OUT WELL IT IS INHIBITED BY EVENTS YOURE LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT DON'T WORK OUT WHEN SOME ONE SAYS THEY'RE GOEN A CALL THAT YOU REALLY REALLY ESIDE TO TALK TO IM THAN THEY DON'T OR YOU THOUGHT A MOVI WAS GOING TO BE REALLY GREAT IN IT'S NOT OR YOU EXPECT A MEALE TO BE REALLY DELICIOUS AND IT'S CUN AND WE ACTUALLY THERE'S A NAME FOR THAT IT'S CALLED REWARD PREDICTION ERROR SO IF AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF MUALES AND PLANS IN A WAY THAT'S VERY USEFUL WITH YOURSELF AND PEOPLE YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY IF YOU EXPECT SOMETHING TO BE REALLY TERRIFIC IT REALLY DOES PLACE A HIGHER EXPECTATION AT THE CHEMICAL LEVEL SO IF YOU DON'T GET AS MUCH DOPAMINE AS YOU'RE EXPECTING FROM SOMETHING SO YOU YOU HEREABOUT A REALLY GREAT RESTAURON TO OR PLACE THAT AS A REALLY IN MICAS I AV A I WON'T CALL AN ADDICTION I WOULD CALLED MORE OF AN AFFLICTION FOR CRASSENTS THE BEST VEGETABLE OF COURSE IS THE CRAESSENT AND I GET REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE FACT THAT SOME ONE WILL TELL ME O THERE'S THIS PLACE IN THE HVE INCREDIBLE CRESSENTE YOU GOT A GO THERE SO YIT REALLY EXCITE A'LL GO AND JUST THEM TELLING ME THAT IT CAN BE REALY TERRIFIC RAISES IN EXPECTATION A DOPAMINE EXPECTATION AND UNLESS THOSE CRESSENTS ARE AMAZING CHANCES ARE I'M GOING TO EXPERIENCE THEM AS LESS GOOD LESS SATISFYING I WILL RTRULY RELEASE LESS DOPAMINE THEN I WOULD HAD THEY JUST SAID OYI THINK THAT THEIRE CRASSENTE DOWN THE STREET OR IF I JUST TRIED ONE AT RANDOM AND THAT'S BECAUSE THIS REWARD PREDICTION ERROR YOURE EXPECTATION OF SOMETHING RELEASES DOPAMINE AND THE ACTUALE EVENT RELEASES DOPAMINE AND IF THE EVENT RELATED DOPAMINE DOES NOT EXCEED THE EXPECTATION OR AT LEAST MATCHIT THERE'S MUCH HIGHER TENDENCY TAT YOU WON'T PURSUE THAT THING AGAIN SO DOPAMINE AS REALLY POWERFUL AND IT'S NOT JUST THE MOLECULE OF REWARD IT IS THE MOLECULE OF DESIRE IT'S THE MOLECULE OF WANTING NOT JUST THE MOLECULE OF HAVING AND A BOOK SINCE PEOPLE OFTEN ASK FOR BOOK RECOMMENDATIONS I DON'T KNOW THE AUTHOR PERSONALLY BUT I LOVE THE BOOK IT'S CALLED THE MOLECULE OF MORE IS A TERRIFIC BOOK I WISH I HAD WRITTEN IT FRANKLY UM BUT IF YOU WANT A LEARN MORE ABOUT DOPAMINE REWARD PREDICTION ERROR AND HOW DOPAMINE REGULATES VARIOUS ASPECTS OF YOUR EMOTIONAL AND MOTIVATIONAL LIFE IT'S A TERRIFIC READ DOPAMINE IS WHAT'S GOING TO LEAD US TO WANT TO EAT MORE OF SOMETHING OR TO NOT WANT MORE OF SOMETHING BECAUSE DOPAMINE REALLY IS ABOUT CRAVING IT'S ABOUT MOTIVATION AND IT'S ABOUT DESIRE AND AS I MENTION THESE A MENOACID CENSORS IN OUR GUT ARE DETECTING HOW MANY A MENOACIDS BUT THEY'RE ALSO DETECTING WHICH AMENO ACIDS AND THE'S A PARTICULAR AMINOACID CALLED EL TYRASINE WHICH COMES FROM FOOD YOU CAN LOOK UP ON LINE WHICH FOODS CONTAIN AL TYRASINE IT IS IN MEATS IT IS IN NUTS IT IS ALSO IN SOME PLANTBASE FOODS EL TYRISINE IS THE PRECURSER TO A COUPLE OTHER MOLECULES LIKE ALTOPA ET CETERA THAT MAKE DOPAMIN AND SO THERE'S A MISCONCEPTION OUT THERE THAT MOST OF THE CERATONAN IS IN OUR GUT AND MOST OF THE DOPAMININ IS IN AUR GOT AND THEREFORE AR MOOD IS IN OUR GUT THAT'S NOT QUITE THE WAY IT WORKS UKA WE'LL TALK ABOUT CERATONAN A MOMENT BUT DOPAMINE IS SYNTHESIZED FROM THE AMENOACIDS THAT YOU EAT HOWEVER THE DOPAMIN NURANS THAT GIVE RISE TO THESE FEELINGS OF GOOD OR WANTING MORE OR DESIRE IN MOTIVATION THOSE RESIDE IN THE BRAIN SO WE DON'T WANT TO GET TOO CONFUSE WE WANT O RESPECT AND HONOR THE POWER OF THE GUT AND THIS VAGAL PATHWAY BUT IT'S REALLY NURONS WITHIN YOUR BRAIN THAT DRIVE THE PURSUIT AND DECISION MAKING SO WHAT DOS THIS MEAN WELL SOME PEOPLE MAKE TOO LITTLE DOPAMINE SOME PEOPLE MAKE SO LITTLE DOPAMINE THAT THEY NEED PERSCRIPTION DOPAMINE THEY NEED ALDOPA PEOPLE WITH PARKINSINS TAKE ALDOPA AND OTHER COMPOUNDS TO INCREASE DOPAMIN BECAUSE PARKINSINS IS ASSOCIATED WITH DEFIS IT'S IN MOVEMENT STARTS AS A TREMOR ASSHE STARTS AS SOME OTHER THINGS THAT ARE INTERESING WILL TALK ABOUT IN A MOMENT BUT PARKINSINS IS A DEPRESSION IT'S A BLUNTING OF MOTIVATION AND MOOD AND AFFECT AND IT'S A TREMOR AND THEN EVENTUALLY IN SEVERE CONDITIONS ITS CHALLENGES IN SPEAKING AND WALKING SO THAT SOME FAMOUS EXAMPLES WOULD BE YOUR MAHAMEDALE MICHAEL JE FOX A THE GREAT BOXING TRAINER FREDIROCH LIKE THESE PEOPLE HAVE PARKINSINS AND THEY AT LEAST LATER IN THEIR LIFE HAD CHALLENGES SPEAKING NOW IT'S NOT JUST FIGHTERS THAT DEVELOP PARKINSINS A AS FAR AS I KNOW A MICHROGE FOX WASN'T A WASN'T A FIGHTER PEOPLE CAN DEVELOP PARKINSINS AND PARKINSINS IS A DEPLETION OF DOPAMI NURANS IN THE BRAIN AND IT'S NOT JUS MOVEMENT CHALLENGES ITS CHALLENGES WITH MOOD NOW HOPEFULLY MOST OF YOU ALL OF YOU A DON'T HAV PARKINSINS BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT DIETARY ELTRISINE SUPPORTS THE HEALTHY PRODUCTION OF THINGS LIKE DOPAMNE AND AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS WITHIN THE BRAIN NOW SOME PEOPLE IMMEDIATELY ASK WHLE SHOULD I SUPPLEMENT ELTYRASINE SO LET JUST TALK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THATS CAN A COME UP AM FULL DISCLOSURE I SOMETIMES TAKE ELTYRAISIN I'M NOT TAKING A RI NOW BUT I TAKE IT ONLY OCCASIONALLY YOU CAN BY THIS IN CAPSIL FORM IT DOES INCREASE KIND OF A MOOD AND ELEVATION AND ALERTNESS IT IS OVER THE COUNTER YOU HAVE TO CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR HEALTHCARE AND NI'M NOT A DOCTOR WHETHER NOT SAFE FOR YOU PEOPLE WITH PREEXISTING HYPER DOPAMEN URGENT CONDITIONS LIKE MENIA SHOULD PROBABLY NOT TAKE EL TYRASINE NHE OTHER THING ABOUT TAKING ALTYRASINE IS THERE IS A CRASH OCA IT'S NOT A MASSIVE CRASH IF YOU TAKE IT TO APPROPRIATE DOSES AND ITS RIGHT FOR YOU BUT IT CAN PRODUCE A CRA ATIONA LETHARGY AND A KIND OF BRAIN FOG AFTER THE NEXT DAY OR SO AND SO ELL TYRACINE HOWEVER CAN BE INGESTED THROUGH FOODS OR THROUGH SUPPLEMENTATION TO INCREASE DOPAMIE LEVELS THAT'S WELL KNOWN TAKING CHRONICALLY HOWEVER IT CAN DISRUPT THOSE DOPAMINE PATHWAYS NOW THERE ARE OTHER DRUGS THAT WILL INCREASE ELT A ALTYRACINE AND DOPAMINE AS WELL BUT THOSE ARE SEVERE ENOUGH THAT THEY GENERALLY TENT AV ADICTIVE PROPERTYES SO THINGS LIKE METHEMPHETAMINE THINGS LIKE COCANE ARE TERRIBLE BECAUSE THEY REALLY RAMP UP THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM SO MUCH THAT PEOPLE REALLY CAN'T ACHIEVE DOPAMINE RELEASE THROUGH ANY OTHER MECHANISMS BUT FOOD AND THE INGESTION OF ALTIRACENE HAS A PROFOUND EFFECT ON OUR LEVELS OF DOPAMNE IT TAKES A LITTLE WHILE BUT THAT REALLY WILL IMPACT LEVEL OF MOOD CERTAIN ANTI DEPRESSENCE FALL INTO THE CATEGORY OF DOPAMINERGIC ANTA DEPRESCENCE ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS ONES OF COURSE IS WELL BUTRON WELL BEUTRAN WITH DEVELOPED BECAUSE HA LOT OF THE OTHER ANDTO DEPRESSENCE TEND TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL KIND OF LETHARGEICA THEY HAD SIDE EFFECT PROFILES THAT PEOPLED IDN'T LIKE SO THEY DEVELOPED THIS THING THAT A THE THE GENERIC NAME IS DIFFERENT BUT ITS GENERALLY CALLED WELL BUTRON WILL BEUTRAN ACTIVATES DOPAMINE AND EPINEFRON WHICH IS A SUBSTRATE OF OF DOPAMINE AND BOTH OF THOSE ARE INVOLVED IN MOTIVATION AND ALERTNESS AN EFFORT SYOU MIGHT SAY WELL THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT DRUG HOWEVER THIS DRUG THE SIDE EFFECT PROFILE TENDS TO BE THE THINGS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ELEVATED MOOD AND ALERTNESS SO THIS IS'N LIKE TAKING SOME ALTIRACINE THIS ISN'T LIKE EATING SOME TIRACINE RICH FOOD THIS IS REALLY A MUCH GREATER RELEASE OF DOPAMINE AND EPINEFRON AND IT INCREASES THINGS LIKE ANXIETY SWEATING THE PUPILS DILATE IT HAS CERTAIN EFFECTS ON A PARTULAR PEOPE WITH EPILEPSY IT'S BEEN USED SOMEWHAT SUCCESSFULLY FOR SMOKING CESSATION BUT AGAIN IT'S NOT FOR EVERYBODY AND I'M NOT HERETO ENCOURAGE THE THE USE OF THESE HINGS I'M JUST DESCRIBING THE BIOLOGY IN THE RATIONAL FOR WHY THESE DRUGS WERE DEVELOPED SO LET'S BACK UP A SECOND AS JUST CON ITAKE STOCK WHERE WE'REAT WE HAVE A BRAIN BODY CONNECTION THERE ARE MANY OF THEM BUT ONE OF THE MAIN ONES IS THE VAGUEST NERVE THE VAGUES COLLECTS INFORMATION ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS BREATHING HEART RATE STUFF THAT'S HAPPENING IN THE GUT ET CETERA AND GOT BY THE WAY INCLUDES THE STOMACH AND THE INTESTINSE SENDS THAT INFORMATION UP TO THE BRAIN THE BRAIN IS USING THAT INFORMATION TO DECIDE ONE OF TWO THINGS MOVE TOWARDS SOMETHING OR MOVE AWAY CAN ALSO PAUSE BUT ESSENTIALLY PAUSING IS NOT MOVING TOWARD SO THAT'S THE DOPAMINE PATHWAY AND FOODS RICH IN ELTIRACINE GENERALLY GIVE US AN ELEVATED MOOD AND MAKE US WONT TO DO MORE OF WHATEVER IT IS THAT WE HAPPEN TO BE DOING AS WELL AS OTHER THINGS MOTIVATION GENERALIZES TO OTHER THINGS ITS NOT UNIQUE TO JUST INGESTING FOODS BUT FOODS THAT GIVE US A BIG PULSOF DOPAMINE WILL MAKE US CRAVE MORE OF THAT FOOD IT WILL MAKE US CRAVE MORE OF THE ACTIVITY THAT LED TO THE INGESTION IN THAT FOOD AND AS I MENTION EARLIER A LOT OF THAT IS HAPPENING AT A SUBCONSCIOUS LEVEL THAT YOU'RE NOT EVEN AWARE OF AND THIS IS WHY I THINK THE CONCERN ABOUT HIDDEN SUGARS AND OVERINGESTION OF SUGARS I IS SERIOUS BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST THAT THE SUGARS ARE IMPACTING OUR BLOOD GLUCOS IN NEGATIVE WAYS ALTHOUGH OFTEN IT IS IT'S NOT JUST THE OBISITY CRISIS THAT'S HAPPENING IT'S ALSO THE FACT THAT ITS DESRUPTING ARE DOPOMINE SYSTEMS NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN ALL SUGAR IS BAD SOME PEOPLE HAVE A QUITE HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP TO SUGAR BUT I THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE JUST NOT AWARE THAT SUGAR ISN'T JUST OPERATING AT THE LEVEL OF TASTE IT'S OPERATED THE LEVEL OF NAUR CHEMICALS AND ITS DOING IT SUBCONSCIOUSLY SO I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER PATHWAYS BETWEEN BRAIN AND BODY THAT REGULATE OUR MOODS IN EMOTIONS BUT ALSO ARE ACTIONABLE SO THE OTHER NERAMODULATOR THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING IN THE CONTEXTS OF THE VAGUS IS SARATONAN SARATONAN JUST TO REMIND YOU IS A NERMODULATOR THEREFORE IT CREATES A BIAS IN WHICH NERL CIRCUITS WHICH NERONS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY ARE GOING TO BE ACTIVE AND IT MAKES IT LESS LIKELY THE OTHER ONES ARE GOING TO BE ACTIVE I THING IT'S FAR TO SAY WITHOUT EVER HAVING MEASURED IT THAT MY BULLDOG COSTELLO IT MUST JUST AS BRAIN EMBODY MUST BE SWIMMING IN SARATONAN BECAUSE HE IS VERY CALM AND HE EATS A LOT BUT HE GENERALLY FEELS PRETTY SATED HE'S KIND OF AN ANIMAL THAT'S OBSESSED WITH COMFORTS IS A BIT OF A HEEDENIST AND SARATONAN WHEN IT'S ELEVATED TENDS TO MAKE US FEEL REALLY COMFORTABLE ACCOUNT OF BLISSED OUT WHEREVER WE ARE AND THAT CONTRAST WIH DOPAMINE AN EPINEPRAN WHICH MAINLY PUT US IN PURSUIT OF THINGS MOTIVATION IS PURSUIT SARATONAN IS MORE ABOUT FEELING REALLY COMFI WHERE WE ARE THE CONVERSATION AROUND THE BRAINBODY RELATIONSHIP AND MOOD IN SARATONAN FOR MANY YEARS WAS WELL YOU EAT A BIG MEAL THE GOT IS DISTENDED HOU'VE GOT ALL THE NEUTRIANCE YOU NEED YOU REST IN DIGEST AND SARATONAN IS RELEASE THAT'S SORD O TRUE BUT THEREIS A LOT MORE GOING ON AND A LOT MORE THAT'S INTERESTING AND ACTIONABLE THAT'S GOING ON FIRST OF ALL SOME OF YOU BUT PERHAPS NOT ALL HA'VE HEARD THAT MORE THAN NINETY PER CENT OF THE SARATONAN THAT WE MAKE IS IN OUR GUT AND INDEED WE HAVE A LOT OF SARATONAN IN OUR GUT WE HAVE NURONS IN OUR GUT HAT MAKE SARATONAN WE HAVE NURONS IN OUR BRAIN THEY MAKE SARATONAN BUT HERE'S THE DEAL MOST OF THE SARATONAN THAT IMPACTS ARE MOOD AND OUR MENTAL STATE IS NOT IN OUR GUT MOST OF IT IS IN THE NURONS OF THE BRAIN IN AN AREA CALLED THE RAPHE NUCLEUS OF THE BRAIN THEIR FEW OTHER LOCATIONS TOO AND THOSE OF THE NERONS THAT CONTROL WHETHER NOT WE FEEL SATIATED OR NOT WHETHER OR NOT WE FEEL HAPPY AND CALM YOU CAN'T HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT SARATONAN WITHOUT HAVING DISCUSSION ABOUT AND TO DEPRESENCE BECAUSE DURING THE LAY EIGHTIES AND EARLY NINETIES THERE WAS IS EXPLOSION IN THE NUMBER OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT WERE RELEASED THINGS LIKE FIRST ONE AND MOST FAMOUS ONE IS PROSAC ZOLOFT AND A PACXIL AE NUMBER OF OTHER ONES THAT ARE SO CALLED S S OR I SELECTIVE SARATONAN REUP TAKE IN HIBITORS THAT'S A LONG ACRANYM BUT BASICALLY THOSE DRUGS WORK BY PREVENTING THE GOBBLING UP OF CERATONAN OR RE UPTAKE OF CARATONAN IN TO NURONS AFTER IT'S BEEN RELEASED WHICH LEADS TO MORE CERATONAN OVER ALL WHICH MEANS TO ELEVATE CERATONAN AND INDEED THOSE DRUGS WERE AND CAN BE VERY USEFUL FOR SCERTAIN PEOPLE TO FEEL BETTER IN CASES OF DEPRESSION AND SOME OTHER CLINICAL DISORDERS AS WELL SO I REALLY DON'T WANT TO A DISMISS THEM AS USELESS OR DANGEROUS FOR EVERYBODY THEY CAN BE QUITE USEFUL FOR MANY PEOPLE NOT EVERYONE RESPONDS WELL TO THEM AS I'M SURE YOU'VE ALL HEARD AND THEIR SIDE TA PAFFECT PROFILE HAS EFFECTS LIKE BLUNTING AFFECT IT CAN MAKE PEOPLE FEEL KIND OF FLAT KIND OF MEC IT CAN A REDUCE APPETITE FOR FOOD IT CAN PRODUSE APPETITE FOR SEX IT CAN DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS OR IT CAN WORK REALLY WELL SOMETIMES IT'S A DOSE RELATED ISSUE ET CETERA CERATONAN IS FASCINATING HOWEVER BECAUSE HOW WELL THOSE NURONS IN THE RAPH THEY WORK IS IMPACTED BY SOME EVENTS WITHIN THE GUT ALTHOUGH YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED TO FIND OUT WHAT THOSE EVENTS ARE SO LET'S GO A LOBIT DEEPER INTO THE GUT AND AGAIN THE GUT INCLODS THE STOMACH AND THEN THE SMALL INTESTAN AND THE LARGE INTESTAN AND ASKED LIKE WHAT IS GOING ON WITH CERATONAN IN THE GUT HOW IS IT IMPACTING CERATONAN IN THE BRAIN AND LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS IN THE CONTET OF HOW SOME OF US MIGHT WANT TO INCREASE OR DECREASE ARE CERATONAN LEVELS SO AS FAR AS I KNOW THERE AREN'T ANY REALLY GOOD AT HOME BLOOD TESTS FOR THINGS LIKE CERATONAN AND DOPOMINE THERE'RE SOME COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS OUT THERE BUT TO ME JUST TO ME I'M NOT PARTICULARLY IMPRESSED YOU KNOW IT'S NOT THE SAME AS GETTING YOUR HORMONS A LEVELS MEASURED OR YOUR METABOLIC FACTORES MEASURED THAT'S CAN BE DONING CAN BE DONE RIGOROUSLY THERE ARE TESTS OUT THERE THERE EVEN SOM A BELIV IT ARE NOT THERE SOME QUESTIONEERS YOU KNOW THAT AND I THINK ACTUALLY LAST YEAR MADE SOME OF THE BIGGER NEWSPAPERS YOU KNOW ARE YOU MORE OF A DOPAMENE OR A CERATONAN ARE YOU OF THIS COR A THAT I FIND THAT STUFF TO BE A LITTLE SILLY ALTHOUGH I DO APPRECIATE AND LIKE THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT AND TALKING BOUT NAUREUMOGULATORS THERE AREN'T REALLY GREAT WAYS TO MEASURE THESE THINGS OUTSIDE THE CLENIC THERE'RE SOME GREAT CLINICAL TOOLS THAT YOU CAN GET INSIDE OF A HOSPITAL OR FROM A PROPER INDER CHRONOLOGIST OR NEUROLOGIST BUT NO GREAT ATHOME TOOLS SO MAVE THAT'S A CALL TO ARMS FOR SOME OF YOU ON TOPRONERIAL FOLKS OUT THERE TO CREATE THESE TESTS A ACCURATE TESTS PLEASE THAT CAN BE DONE AT HOME BUT YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEIR TOO ANXIOUS OR THERE ALWAYS IN A MOTIVATED STATE IN THEIR TRINE TO ADJUSTS THEIR CERATONAN MANY PEOPLE ADJUST THEIR CERATONAN BY JUST EATING MORE FOOD AND CARBOHYDRATE RICH FOODS WILL INCREASE CERATONAN I'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS ON A PREVIOUS PODCAST BUT I PERSONALLY AM A BIG FAN AT LEAST FOR ME AS I USUALLY FAST AND EXERCISE IN THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY I EAT A RELATIVELY HIGH PROTINE MODERATE FAT ZERO CARB OR LOW CARB DO A MEAL AT LUNCHEAN IN THE AFTERNOON TO STAY ALERT BECAUSE THOSE FOODS TEND TO FAVOR DOPING PRODUCTION AS SEET OF CALLING PRODUCTION P ANEF FROM PRODUCTION AND ALERTNESS MY MOOD IS GENERALLY PRETTY GOOD MOST OF THE TIME AND THEN AS EVENING COMES AROUND AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT SLEEP AND A GOOD NIGHTS SLEEP I NOT CONCERNED IN AN ANXIOUS WAY BUT I WANT TO GET A GOOD NIGHT' SLEEP I WILL INGJEST FOODS THAT PROMOTE CERATONAN RELEASE BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN A LOT OF TRIP TO FAN SO IF I DO EAT MEAT IT WOULD BE LIKE A WHITE MEAT TURKEY MEAT I DON'T TEND TO I I'VE NEVER LIKE TURKEY I DON'T MIND THE ANIMAL BUT I DON'T LIKE AN JESTING THE MEA UM BUT STARCHY CARBORHYDRATES WILL INCREASE SERATONAN SOME PEOPLE ALSO WILL TAKE SERATONA THEY YOU CAN NOW BUY FIVE H T P SUPPLEMENTS ZILOBIT TRICKEY FIVE AH T P SUPPLEMENTS CAN OF COURSE INCREASE FIVE AH T P IT IS FIVE AH TP OR  OR SERATONAN BUT THAT SOMETIMES CAN CREATE PROBLEMS IN INDOGENOUS OR SELF MADE PRODUCTION OF SERATONAN SO I'M NEVER A FAN OF TAKING THINGS VERY CLOSE TO THE CHEMICAL YOUR TRYIN INCREASE FOR VERY LONG PERIODS OF TIME MAY BE FOR OCCASIONAL USE I HAVE THE PROBLEM THAT IF I TAKE SERATONAN SUPPLEMENTS FIVE H T P I FALL SLEEP THE SLEEP I HAVE IS VERY INTENSE AND I WAKE UP THREE OR FOUR HOURS LATER AND WE KNOW BASED ON SLEEP STUDIES WITH GOOD MEASUREMENTS IN THE LAB THAT SERATONAN RELEASE TENDS TO BE IN THE LATER PART OF THE NIGHT AND SO BY TAKING I EARLY IN THE NIGHT IT REALLY CAN DESTRUP THE PATTERNOF SLEEP IN THE DEPTH OF SLEEP NONE THE LESS SOME PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN TAKING CERATONAN TO GET SOME OF THE MORE BLISTOUT EFFECTS YOU CAN ACHIEVE THAT WITH FOODS AS I MENTION THAT ARE CARBOHYDRATE RICH SO AS YOUR SEEING THIS ISN'T REALLY A DISCUSSION ABOUT NUTRICIAN PERSAY THIS IS DISCUSSION ABOUT FOOD WHICH CONTAINS A MENO ACIDS A MENO ACIDS BEING THE PRECURSORS TO NAROMODULATORS AND NROMODULATORS HAVING A PROFOUND EFFECT ON YOUR FEET OVER ALL STATE OF ALERTNESS OR CALMNESS HAPPINESS SADNESS AND WELL BEING SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT ONE UM CAN TAKE AS I MENTION ONE OF THEM BEING FIVE H T P ITSELF NOW IM NOT RECOMMENDING PEOPLE TAKE ANYTHING BUT IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN WHAT THIS DOES AND YOU WANT TO EXPLORE THIS OF COURSE YOU'D WANT PERMISSION FROM YOUR DOCTOR YOU CAN GO TO THIS FREE WEB SITE I LOVE THIS RESOURCE THEY DON'T PAY ME TO SAY THAT BY JUST LOVE THIS RESOURCE I FOLLOWED IT FOR LONG TIME CALLED EXAMINE DOT CALM THANK YOU FOLKS THAT EXAMINED OT COM FOR PUTTING THIS FREE RESOURCE OUT ON THE WEB THAT HAS LINK THROUGH WHAT THEY CALL THE HUMAN AFFECT MATRICS SO IT'S LINKS TO ALL THE PUBMED STUDIES FOR PARTICULAR EFFECTS OF PARTICULAR COMPOUNDS THAT ONE CAN BINE IN JEST INCREDIBLE AS WELL AS IMPORTANT HEALTH WARNINGS SO M NOTCIN T READ THROUGH EVERYTHING BUT IF YOU WERE TO GO TO EXAMINED OT CALM AS I HAVE NOW AND YOU'D PUT IN FIVE H T P THERE ONLY LOOK IN THINGS THAT HAVE STRONG EVIDENCE PUBMED ARTICLES ARTICLES THERE ARE ARE IN THE PUBMET ARCIVES SO FOR INSTANCE I DIDN'T KNOW THIS BUT FIVE H T P PRODUCES A NOTABLE DECREASE IN APPETITE THREE STUDIES AND THE AP APPETITE SUPPRESSION MAKE SENSE OF COURSE BECAUSE WE INGEST FOODS TO GET SERATONAN AND IF WE HAVE ENOUGH SERATONAN THEN THERE'S NO REASON TO INJEST MORE FOODS ITTENDS TO HAVE A BLUNTING OF APPETITE IT PROBABLY T OES THAT ALSO THROUGH OTHER MECHANISMS SO I'M NOT SAYING YOU SHIT IS BUT IF SOMEONE TRIND OF BLUNT THEIR APPETITE COULD BE A INTERESTING ROUTE ALTHOUGH I DON'T RECOMMEND CHRONIC USE NOT SURPRISINGLY HAS IT THERE'S A DECREASE IN BODYWEIGHT A AS A CONSEQUENCE AN INCREASING CORTES ALL SO THAT'S KIND OF IM PORTANT TO NOTE THAT WHEN YOU TYPICALLY IN BIOLOGY IF YOU PULL ON ONE STRING REALLY HARD AND OTHER ONE MOVES ITS SLOBIT LIKE A APUPPET AND THEIR S MORE THAN ONE STRING ON THE PUPPET SO IT DOES SEEM TO INCREASE CORTERS ALL THOUGH THEY REPORT AS A MINOR EFFECT AGAIN LINKS TO ALL THOSE STUDIES ARE THERE WHICH IS WHY IAM NOT LISTING THEM OUT IN OUR CAPTION NOTES YOU CAN GO AND GET THEM AN EXAMINED OUT COM PUT IN CERATONEN AND YOU'LL FIND THAT SO I FIND IT FASCINATING THAT NOWADAYS THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN DOING NOTHING GETTING CERATONAN FROM TRIPDIFAN AND FOODS AND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THEREIS IS OTHER CATEGORY OF SUPPLEMENTS THAT ARE REALLY INTERESTING FOR MODULATING A THESE CHEMICALS IN THE BODY AND I SHOULD MENTION BEFORE I MOVE ON BEAUSE I MENTIONED ALTYRICINE I NEGLECTED TO MENTION EARLIER IN OUR DISCUSSION ABOUT DOPOMINE I F YOUR INTEREST IN THE DOPAOMINE PATHWAY GO TO EXAMINED OT CALM PUT IN MCUNA PURANS ITS M U C U AN A P SEPARATE WORD P ARE OU ARE I E AN ASS IT IS A VELVET BEAN THAT GROWS FROM VINES AND IS VERY ITCHY TO TOUCH DUE TO CERATONAN ON ITS SURFACE AMAZING THIS BEING HAS CERATONEN ON ITS SURFACE AND INDEED CERATONAN AT IF YOU ARE TO PUT IT ON YOUR SKIN WOULD CAUSE SOME IRRITATION OF THE SKIN AMAZING INSIDE THE BEN IS EL DOPA MACUNAPURIANS IS NOT JUST SOMETHING THAT PROMOTES DOPAMING RELEASE BECAUSE OF SOME WEIRD MISTICAL ANCIEN THING OR WHATEVER RSORCERY IT IS CHEMICALLY EL DOPA THE PRECURSER TO DOPAMI IT CONTAIN SOME OTHER MOLECULES AS WELL AND LOW LEVELS OF OTHER PSYCHOACTIVES THE STUFF IS AVAILABLE OVER THE COUNTER INCREDIBLE I PERSONALLY FIND INCREDIBLE ITS EFFECTS ARE REALLY INTERESTING I'M NOCKIN A READ THEM ALL OFF BUT I MENTION THESE AFFECTS NOT BECAUSE I'M ENCOURAGING YOU TO TAKE IT BUT BECAUSE YOU GET A WINDOW INTO WHAT DOPAMIN ACUTE DOPAMING INCREASE DOES IN THE NON PARCANSONIAN CONTECT AND YOU CONSTRUCT TO THINK ABOUT FOODS THAT ARE RICH IN AL TYRICENE AS BIACING CERTAIN AFFECTS ARE NOT OTHERS SO WHEN YOU HAR FOOD IS MEDICINE FOOD AS IN REALLY MEDICINE FOOD IS FOOD BUT FOOD HAS THESE CHEMICAL EFFECTS AS WELL SO FIRST ONE LISTED A IS THREE STUDIES WITH VERY HIGH A RIGOR THAT OVER ALL HAVE A MINOR EFFECT ON OF ALL THINGS SPIRM QUALITY SO IS APPEARS THAT SPIRM MOTILITY ITSELF I 'AM ASSUMING WHEN THEY SAY SPIRM QUALIDY OWN WHAT FEATURES OFH SPIRM OF QUALITY THEY LOOKED OUT WITH SPIRM THITS NOT DISCUSSION ON ONE A HALF BUT I'M ASSUMING ITS MOTILITY BECAUSE I KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY TO KNOW THAT A SPERM AABILITY TO SWIM DEPENDS ON SOME PROTINES THAT ARE PRESENT IN THE FRONT OF THE SPIRM ET CETERA THINGS LIKE PENTRACONS AND SPIRM MOTILITY AS A GENERALLY ASSOCIA WITH SPER QUALITY SPIRM THE DON'T MOVER GENERALLY NOT VERY USEFUL SPIRM I'M SYMPTOMS OF PARKANSON DISEASE ARE ARE NOTABLY DEGRADED WITH MACUNE APPEARANCE SO FASCINATING THAT'S NOT SURPRISING AND THERE A LOT OF OTHER EFFECTS HERE FEELINGS OF SUBJECTIVE WELL BEING TESTOSTERON REDUCTIONS IND PROLACKED AND NOT SURPRISING PROLACTIN IS A HORMON THAT'S INVOLVED IN MILK LET DOWN IT'S IN OF IN LACTATING MOTHERS IT'S INVOLVED IN FEELINGS OF PEACE AND A GENERALLY IS ANTAGONISTIC TO SECUAL DESIRE IN BOTH MEN AND FEMALE A SO IT'S REALLY INTERESTING THAT THINGS LIKE MACUNAPPERIANS WHICH ARE AL DOPA REDUCED PROLACT AND INCREASE PER MOTILITY INCREASE TESTOSTERON SUBJECTIVE WELL BEING SO YOU STARVING TO SEE A THEME RIGHT DOPOMIN REALLY MAKES US MOTIVATED FEEL IN PURSUIT MAKES US FEEL GOOD CERATONA MAKES US FEEL MORE RELAXED AND CALM NOW THIS WHOLE MONTH IS ABOUT EMOTIONS WE MIGHT BE THINKING W WAIT WHERE ARE WE GOING WITH ALL THIS IS IT RELATES TO EMOTIONS BUT IN THE LAST EPISODE I SAID SOMETHNG OWHEN A REPEAT IT NOW BRIEFLY WHICH IS THAT MUCH OF WHAT WE TALK ABOUT AS GOOD EMOTIONS OR BAD EMOTIONS THERE'S A CONTEXT TO THAT THERE'S A SOCIAL CONTAXT YOU CAN'T REALLY SAY AN EMOTION IS GOOD OR BAD GRIEVING AT A FUNERAL IS HEALTHY OKI BEING HAPPY AT A FUNERAL PRESUME ASSUMING YOU LOVED THE PERSON THAT DIED IS MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY WOULDN THINK THAT WAS HEALHY SO WE CAN'T REALLY SAY THAT CERTAIN YOU KNOW MOTIONS LIKE SADNESS OR HAPPINESS ARE HEALTHY ITS CONTEXT IS IMPORTANT CULTIAL CONTETS IS IMPORTANT MANY OF YOU 'VE ASKED FOR BOOK RECOMMENDATIONS THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE A MENTION OF ANOTHER BOOK AGAIN I DON'T HAVE ANY FINANCIAL FILIATION OR ANYTHING BUT IF YOU WANT TO READ MORE ABOUT EMOTIONS AND HOW THE CONTEXT AND CULTURAL THINGS IMPACT OUR EMOTIONS I'M A HUGE FAN OF LISA FELDMAN BEAR IT AM I LEARNED ABOUT HER FROM THE LEXFRDMAN PODCAST A I'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH HER AL MY INSTEGRAND LIVE SHE'S AT NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY A WORLD EXPERT IN EMOTIONS HER FIRST BOOK IS HOW EMOTIONS ARE MADE THIS NOT A BOOK SHE SENT ME I PAID FOR THIS WITH MY OWN MONEY A YEARS AGO BOUGHT IT READ IT LOVED IT LONG BEFORE I MET LEISA M JUST DELIGHTED THAT WE'VE GOT TO KNOWN EACH OTHER A LITTLE BIT IT'S A REALLY INTERESTING READ INTO THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EMOTIONS AND SOME OF THE SUBJECTIVITY OF EMOTIONS SO WHERE AS I'M TALKING ABOUT MAINLY THE BIOLOGY OF EMOTIONS THIS GETS A LO BIT MORE INTO THE PSYCHOLOGY OTHOUGH THE BIOLOGY AS WELL AND LESAS JUST A TERRIFIC SHE'S ALSO PUTTING A LOT OF INFORMATION OUT INTO THE WORLD ABOUT EMOTIONS SO IF YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THAT A CHECK OUT HER WORK AGAIN ITS LISA FELDMEN BEAR IT AND THAT BOOK IS HOW EMOTIONS ARE MADE HOFULY SHALL CONTINUE TO WRITE MANY MORE BAKES A BOOKS SO NOW YOU UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP I HOPE BETWEEN FOODS AND DOPOMINE FOODS AND SERATONAN AND THAT THERE BOTH BEING COMMUNICATE TO THE BRAIN VIA THE VAGUUST RIGHT WE INJEST THESE FOODS WI THESE SUPPLEMENTS ARE THINGS PEOPLE TAKE THEY DON'T PUT THEM DIRECTLY INTO THE BRAIN THEY PUT THEM IN OUR GUT SO YES THERE'S A GUT BRING CAN NECTION BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT THE SCERATONAN IN THE GUT THAT MAKES YOU FEEL CALM AND PLACID IT'S NOT ABOUT THE DOPAMINE IN THE GUT IT'S JUST BEEN OVERSOLD THAT WAY BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING REALLY ATTRACTIVE AND I UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE IDEA THAT BECAUSE CERTAIN THINGS ABOUT OUR EXPERIENCE OF LIFE AND OUR EMOTIONS IS HAPPENING IN OUR BODY THAT MAYBE WE HAVE A LITTLE MORE CONTROL RIGHT BECAUSE THIS THING IS A HARD CONTAINER WE CAN'T JUST STUFF SOME DOPAMINE AND THERE I CAN'T JUST LE YOU KNOW TI COULD PROBABLY TAKE A MACUNAPURINES BEIN AND STUFF IT IN MY EAR PLEASE DON'T DO THAT IT MAKE MYHT YOUR ITCHECAUSE OF THE CERATONAN ON THE OUTSIDE WE CAN'T GET STUFF IN THERE WE YOU HAVE TO DO AS IN JEST THINGS THAT ARE METABOLIZED IN CERTAIN WAYS THAT COMMUNICATE TO THE BRAIN OR SO MAYBE THEY PASS INTO THE BRAIN THEMSELVES ACROSS WHAT'S CALLED THE BLOOD BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER OR TALK ABOUT THE BLOOD RAIN BARRIER IN A MINUTE IT'S AS SHE ALLED THE B B B SO IT ENDS AT THE SOUNDING LIKE BABY BBB AM I GUESS THAT'S LIKE B B ANYWAY BA B  B B BUT THER'RE ALSO NERVES IN THE GUT THAT ARE SENSING THE NEUTRIENT CONTENTS OF FOOD AND THEN SAYING OH YOU SHOULD FEEL BETTER AND WANT MORE OH THAT'S GOT A LOT OF A BITTERNESS AND ACID TASTE TO IT YOU SHOULD WANT LESS OF THAT O K SO AS I TRANSITION OUT OF THE DISCUSSION ABOUT DOPAMIN AN CERATONAN AND THE GOT HOPEFULLY YOU'VE GOT SOME ACTIONABLE ITEMS THERE UNDER YOUR BELT PON INTENDED WHERE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND HOW CERTAIN FOODS AND CERTAIN NEUTRIENCE AND YOU CAN LOOK THESE UP MIGHT IMPACT YOUR YOUR MOOD IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO'S REALLY ANXIOUS AND REALLY WIRED WELL THEN THE DOPAMEN A DRENNALIN PATHWAY UP AND EFFERN PATHWAYS PROBABLY NOT ONE THAT YOU WANT TO LEAN ON ANY HARDER IF YOU TEND TO BE SOMEONE WHOS PRETTY PASSIVE IN YOUR HAVING TROUBLE WITH MOTIVATION WELL THEN THINK ABOUT RAMPING UP THE DOPAMINE PATHWAY A I ALWAYS THINK BEHAVIORS AND PROPER FOOD CHOICES THE BEST WAY TO START AND A BEHAVIORS INCLUDE THINGS LIKE EXERCISE ET CETERA BUT ONE OF THE PROMS WITH THE DISCUSSION AROUND MOOD AND EXERCISE OR MOOD AND MEDITATION IS THAT IT'S SO SUBJECTIVE S LIKE I LOVE CERTAIN FORMS OF EXERCISE AND NOT OTHERS CERTAIN ONES ARE AVERSIVE TO ME CERTAIN ONES ARE ATTRACTIVE TO ME AND IT'S NEVER REALLY CLEAR NO ONE'S EVER TOLD ME OKE IT YOU HAVE TO DO YOU KNOW TEN MINUTES ON THE BIKE AT EX NUMBER OF OR PIM IT SO AND SO OR ON THE SKEAR IN ORDER TO GET YOUR DOPAMINE UP BUT WE CAN ACTUALLY SAY IF YOU IN JEST MORE AL TIRASCENE THERE'S A HIGH PROBABILITY THAT YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE MORE DOPAMIN AND I'M TIME IGHT IN JUSTING IT THROUGH FOOD OR THROUGH SUPPLEMENTATION IF IF YOU LIKE MACUNIPERIENCE I'VE TRIED I SHOULD JUST MENTION IT WAS TOO DOPAMAN ERGIC FOR ME I REALLY REALLY JAZED UP AND THEN SEVERE CRASH FOR ME THE NEXT DAY AH BUT THAT'S I THINK BECAUSE I TEND TO RIDE PRETTY HIGH ON THE KIND OF ALERTNESS AND MOTIVATION SCALE I'M ALWAYS BEING TOLD LIKE COSTELLO AND OTHER PEOPLE IN THE POK ASTUDIA SLOW MY SPEECH DOWN THIS IS ME UN CAFANATED AND I COUN PROBABLY AFFORD A LITLE MORE SERATONAN IN MY LIFE SO WHERE AS COSTELLO YOU GUT AFFORD W YOU GOET AFFORD TO WAKE UP EVERY EVERY COUPLE DAYS IN JUST A HILL LOW TO US THIS DOG SLEEPS MORE THAN ANY OTHER CREATURE IT'S REMARKABLE SO THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO AND THEIR ACTIONABLE AND THEY ARE I IN SOME WAYS THEIR QUANTITATIVE BECAUSE YOU CAN REGULATE DOSAGEIS AND YOU CAN REGULATE AMOUNTS AND YOU CAN REGULATE TIMING AND EVERYONE HAS TO PLAY WITH THESE THINGS AND FIGURE OUT WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THEM IN TERMS OF FEEDING AND EVERYONE HAS TO EXPLORE AND UNDERSTAND WHAT SAFE AND RITE FOR THEM BUT AND OF COURSE EXERCISE IS STILL VERY IMPORTANT I TALKED ABOUT SOCIAL CONNECTION IN THE LAST EPISODE SUPERIMPORTANT FOR ACTIVATION OF SERTONIN BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THIS GOT BRAIN BODY BRAIN RELATIONSHIP WHAT WE EAT REALLY MATTERS IN TERMS OF THE NORL CHEMICALS THAT WE MAKE SO AT'S TALK A LITTLE BIT OF MORE ABOUT THINGS THAT WE INJEST IN OUR BODY AND THEN ALLOW OUR BODY TO IN FORM OUR BRAIN TO SHIFT OUR MOOD AND THIS IS SOMETHING I'VE I'VE BEEN DOING FOR YEARS AND I JUST WANT TO SAY I'VE FOUND TO BE A COMPLETE GAME CHANGER THERE'S EXCELLENT SCIENCE TO SUPPORT IT AND I THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH IT IN A DIFFERENT CONTECT BUT I DON'T THINK MOST PEOPLE KNOW THIS SIMPLE FACT WHICH IS THAT THE OMEGA THREE TO A MEGASIX FADIACID RATIO HAS A PROFOUND EFFECT ON DEPRESSION IT HAS A PROFOUND EFFECT ON MOOD SO MUCH SO THAT IN A DOUBLE BLIND PLOCIBO CONTROLLED STUDY THAT I WILL PROVIDE THE LINK TO THIS IS A STUDY FIRST PUBLISHIN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT BUT THEREHAVE BEEN MANY OTHERS AS WELL FIRST OF ALL AN EXPERIMENT DONE IN ANIMALS THEY FOUND THERE'S A MODEL OF LEARNED HELPNESSES AND ANIMALS IT'S NOT VERY KIND TO THE ANIMALS BUT THEY PUT RATS OR MICE IN A JAR THEY LET THEM SWIM AND THEY'LL SWIM SWIM SWIM TO TRY AND SAVE THEIR LIFE AND EVENTUALY THEY GIVE UP TO LEARNE HELPLESSNESS THEY DON'T LET THEM DROWN THEY TAKE THEM OUT A JUSTING THE OMEGATHREOMEGASIXS RATIO SO THAT THE OMEGA THREES ARE HIGHER LED TO LESS LEARNED HELPLESSNESS MEANING THESE ANIMALS WOULD SWIM LONGER O CAN HO THAT'S AN ANIMAL THAT'S A RAT NOT A PARTICULARLY KIND STUDY BUT THAT SAME STUDY WAS ESSENTIALLY DONE IN HUMANS ALTHOUGH THEY DIDN'T HAVE THEM SWIM TO THE POINT OF NEAR DROWNING WHAT THEY DID IS THEY TOOK PEOPLE WHO WERE CLINICALLY DEPRESSED MAJOR DEPRESSION CAN MAJOR DEPRESSION IS SEVERE MALEDAPTIVE STATE MEANING IT INHIBITS JOG RELATIONSHIPS APPETITE ALL SORTS OF NEGATIVE HELTH EFFECTS AND THEY DID A COMPARISON OF A THOUSAND MILIGRAMS A DAY OF E P A SO E P A IS ONE OF THE ELEMENTS WHI THAT CONTAINS HIGH LEVELS OF OMEGA THREES THAT'S IN THINGS LIKE FISH OIL TALK ABOUT OTHER SOURCES IN A LOW BIT BUT IT WASN'T A THOUSAND MILIGRAMS OF FISOI IT WAS A THOUSAND MILIGRAMS OF E P A COMPARED THAT TO TWENTY MILIGRAMS OF FLUOXITINE WHICH IS PROSAC MOKE REALLY INCREASE OF CERATONAN AND IN THIS STUDY OF SIXTY INDIVIDUALS AGAIN I'LL PROVIDE THE THE LINX TO THE STUDY THEY FOUND THAT THEY WERE EQUALLY EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS SO IMAGINE THAT A FOOD BASED COMPOUND THAT YOU CAN'T MAKE WITHOUT RIGHT THIS IS NOT I A SITUATION WHERE YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN A MAGA THREES YOU HAVE TO GET THEM FROM FOOD SOURCES OR FROM SUPPLEMENTATION WAS AS EFFECTIVE AS TWENTY MELIGRAMS OF FLUOXITINE OVER THE COURSE OF EIGHT WEEKS AND WHAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING IN ADDITION TO THAT IS THAT THE COLMINATION OF A THOUSAND MELIGRAMS OF E P  AND FLUOXITINE HAD TA CENERGISTIC EFFECT IN LOWERING DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS I FIND THIS REMARKABLE I HEARD ABOUT THIS WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT AND I WASN'T SURE WHAT TO MAKE OF IT CAUSE THEIR LOT OF STUDIES THAT COME OUT AND I GENERALLY LIKE TO FOCUS MY CHANGES IN BEHAVIOR AROUND THINGS WHERE THRE'S A LARGE CENTER OF MASTERS A LOT OF INFORMATION A COUPLE YEARS LATER I DID IN FACT START TAKING A THOUSAND MILIGRAMS PER DAY OF E P  IN FISH OIL NOW THERE ARE A FEW SIDE EFFECTS OF FISH OIL A PEOPLE WHO HAVE BLOOD T WHO ARE BLEADERS WHO HAVE FACTORFIVE LIGHT INMUTATIONS OR A IN A WOMEN WHO ARE TAKING BIRTH CONTROL WHICH CAN MAKE YOU WHICH CAN EFFECT BLOOD CLOTDING IN THINGS THAT SORT REALLY SHOULD TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR I MAKE SURE IT SO K FOR YOU FISH OIL ALSO CAN GIVE PEOPLE FISHY BREATH WHICH IS PREGROSS FRANKLY BUT THEYRE NOW FISH OILS THAT O EITHER BECAUSE OF THE INCAPSCILLATIONS OR BECAUSE OF THE AM THEY PUT SOME LEMON FLAVORING IN THEIR DOESN'T HAVE THAT EFFECT IN ANY EVENT A THOUSAND MLIGRAMS PERDAY OF E P  I STARTEN INJESTING THAT REGULARLY I JUST FELT BETTER I WASN'T CLENICALLY DEPRESS BUT I GENERAL I DID FEEL AT LEAST FOR ME AND INCREAS IN MOOD AND AFFECT AND A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS THAT SPUS TO REDUCE INFLAMMATION THE CARTYOF ASCULAR EFFECTS ARE CONTROVERSIAL FOR A LONG TIME EVERYONE THOUGHT THE EFFECTS ON PLATELETS WERE REALLY TERRIFIC THEN THERE ARE ARTICLES THAT CAME OUT IN MAJOR NEWSPAPERS SAYING MAY BE NOT SO MUCH BUT THE EFFECTS ON MOOD ARE REALLY PROFOUND AND NOW THERE ARE LOTS OF STUDIES IF YOU GO INTO PUBMED AND YOU WERE TO PUT E P A OR FISH OIL AND DEPRESSION YOU WOULD FIND THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF REALLY IMPRESSIVE RESULTS SHOWING THAT IT'S AT LEAST AS EFFECTIVE AS CERTAIN ESSESSORISE INTO DEPRESSONS AT THESE DOSAGES AND IT CAN AMPLIFY OR IMPROVE THE EFFECT OF LOWDOSAGES OF SOME OF THESE FCESSORISE SO I FEEL LIKE MORE PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THIS THIS IS NUTRITION BUT IT'S PROFOUNDLY EFFECTING MOOD AND DEPRESSION IS TERRIBLE RIGHT DEPRESSION CAN HAVE A COMPONENT OF ANXIETY IN SOME CASES WHERE PEOPLE ARE THEY FEEL LOUSY AND VERY UNCERTAIN THAT'S COUNT OF HOW I TALK ABOUT DEPRESSION WITH ANXIETY AS YOU KNOW YOU TALK TO SON'S ANXIOUS AND YOU CAN TELL THEM EVERYTHINGS CAN BE OKE O AND THERE ALWAYS CONCERNI ABOUT WHAT MIGHT THEY MIGHT NOT KNOW YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW THE PLAIN ISN'T GOING TO CRASH YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT LIFE IS GOING TO GOOKA AND IN SOME SENSE THE RIGHT NO ONE HAS A CRYSTAL BALLER CAN PREDICT THE FUTURE BUT THEY TEND TO PERSEVERATE OR FIXATE ON THE UNCERTAINTY AND THEN OF COURSE THEREARE DIVERSIONS OF DEPRESSION THAT INVOLVE CERTAINTY PEOPLE ARE LETHARGIC AND THEI'RE CERTAIN THEY SAY YE I'M CERTAIN IM N EVER GET AGA ANOTHER JOB I'M CERTAIN I'M NEVER GAN O MEET ANYONE NEW I'M CERTAIN IM CAN AV FAIL SO THERE'S THIS KIND OF A DIVIDE IN THAT IN THE SPHERE OF DEPRESSION AROUND CERTAINTY AND UNCERTAINTY BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THIS THOUSAND MILIGRAMS PER DA OR MORE OF E P E HAS BEEN SHOWN TO RELIEF BOTH FORMS OF DEPRESSION NOW TESZAMEANS CAN WORK FOR EVERYBODY NO I'M NOT HERE TO TRY AND PLACE PSYCHITRIS I WANT A POINT YOU IN THE DIRECTION OF THESE MANUSCRIPTS SO THAT YOU CAN MAKE IM FORM CHOICES FOR YOURSELF YOU CAN DISCUSS IT WITH YOUR DOCTOR AND FAMILY AND MAKE THEI CHOICES THAT ARE RIGTE FOR YOU BUT HERE'S WHAT'S ESPECIALLY INTERESTING ABOUT THE HEART OF FECTS BECAUSE WE'VE HEARD THAT THESE OMEGA THREES WHICH OF COURSE YOU CAN GET FROM OTHER SOURCES TOO YOU CAN GET FROM FATTY FISH THERE FLACX SEEDS HEMP SEEDS UM THERE ARE NMBER CHA SEEDS THESE KINDS OF THINGS UM BUT THE LEVELS OF E PE THAT ARE REQUIRED ARE QUITE HIGH SO THIS THOUSAND MILEGRAMS PER DAY IS A THAT'S PRETTY HARD TO GET FROM FOOD ALTHOUGH IT CAN BE DONE DEPENDING ON WHAT WHAT YOU'RE EATING WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT THE HEART EFFECTS THAT ARE SOLID THAT REALLY STAND UP IN THE LITERATURE HAVE A LOT MORE TO DO WITH SOMETHING WE TALKED ABOUT IN A PREVIOUS EPISODE NOW MENTION AGAIN WHICH IS HEARTRATE VARYABILITY SO WE KNOW THAT HAVING A HEART RATE THAT'S REALLY HIGH OR HEART RATE THAT'S REALLY LOW NEITHER OF THOSE ARE GOOD LOPPYOUPLE THINK OW YOU JUST WANT A LOW HEARTRATE BIG STROKE VOLUME YOU KNOW IF YOU'R RUN IN A LOT YOU MAY THIRTY OR FORTY BEATS PER MINUTE THAT'S GREAT TO BE IN SHAPE BUT YOU STILL WANT HEARTRATE VERIABILITY IT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH THE TONE OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM TALK ABOUT LAST TIME HOW WHEN YOU INHAL IT SPEEDS UP HEART RATE WHEN YOU EXTALE IT DECREASES HEARTRATE THAT'S CALLED RESPIRATORY SINESS A RHYTHMEIT'S THE BASIS OF HARTRATE VERYABILITY  MAYBE DO A SHORTPOST ABOUT THIS SO YOU DON'T THAT YOU AN GET ALL THE MECHANISM AND AD THE BEHAVIORS THAT A SPILL OUT OF THAT THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL FOR YOU BUT THE POINT IS HEART RATE VERYBUILDY H ARVY IS GOOD AND WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT THERE WAS A STUDY IN TWO THOUSAND NINE THAT SHOWED THAT PEOPLE WHO EAT A DIET WHERE THERE AND FAIL TO SUPPLEMENT IN A WAY THAT THERE'S A HIGH OMAGA SIX TO THREE RATIO SO NOT ENOUGH OMAGA THREES NOT ONLY ARE THE MARKERS OF IN IN FLAMMATORY SID OKINES ELEVATED THINGS LIKE ILE SIX AND TAN F ALPHA BUT THEY TEND TO BE NONROUSPONDERS TO ANTI DEPRESSENS SHIFTING THAT OMAGA THREE OMAGA SIX RATIO DID A COUPLE THINGS FIRST OF ALL INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF E P E SHIFTED THE RATIOSOS HIER OMAGA THREE TO AMAGA SIX RATIO WHICH WAS GOOD LOWERED THE INFLAMMATION MARKERS AND THEN A LOUD ANTA DEPRESSENCS TO HAVE THEIR EFFECT EVEN AT LOBOSES AND HERE'S THE REALLY INTERESTING THING IT WORKED BY INCREASING HEARTRATE VARYABILITY AND YOU THINK HOW IN THE WORLD WITH THIS HAPPEN BUT YOU KNOW HOW ING THAT'S A TON OF EFFECTS BUT THE WAY IT WORKS IS BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THESE THINGS ARE IMPACTING THE GUT AND THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM REMEMBER EARLIER I SAID THE VAGUES INCLUDES CONNECTIONS FROM THE HEART SIGNALLING ABOUT CENSORY INFORMATION ABOUT HOW FAST THE HEART IS BEATING TO THE BRAIN NOT JUST STUFF FROM THE LUNGS BUT INFORMATION FROM THE HEART AND THE BRAIN THAN A JUST HEARTRATE BY HEARTRATE VERYABILITY SO IT'S INCREDIBLE THAT THERE IS A WAY THAT ONE CAN USE THE GOT THE INGESTION OF MORE OF THESE EPAS EITHER THROUGH FOOD OR SUPPLEMENTATION TO INCREASE HEARTRATE VERYABILITY AND THEREBY TO IMPROVE SYMPTOMS MEANING REDU SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION AND TO EVEN MAKE LOW LEVELS OF ANTA DEPRESSENCE THAT WOULDN'T OTHERWISE WORK WORK AND I THINK I LIKE THO STUDY SO MUCH BECAUSE A ITS SUPERCOOL IT BRIDGES THE BRAIN BODY ACCIS IT INCORPORATES NUTRITIAN AND MICHRONEUTRIENCS IN THE BRAIN BUT ALSO CAUSE IT REALLY POINTS TO SOMETHING THAT WE HEARE ALL THE TIME WHICH IS OUR BODY IS A WHOLE SYSTEM ITS WORKING IS A WHOLE SYSTEM AN THE BRAIN IS IN WORKING AN ISOLATION UP THERE IN THA IN THE SKULL IT'S REACTING THE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN THE BODY IN THE GUT AND IN THE HEART RATE AND HEART RATE VERY ABILITY AND THAT THE THINGS WE INJEST CAN HAVE A PROFOUND EFFECT ON THEM NOW OF COURSE I REALLY ONE EMPHASIZE SOMETHING WHICH IS THAT NO ONE COMPOUND OR NEUTRIENT OR SUPPLEMENT OR DRUG OR BEHAVIOR FOR THAT MATTER IS GOING TO BE THE BE ALL END ALL OF SHIFTING OUT OF DEPRESSION OR IMPROVING ONE'S MOOD OR IMPROVING SLEEP IT'S A CONSTELLATION OF THINGS AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE WHEN PEOPLE START TO GET EXCITED ABOUT SUPPLEMENTS AND DRUGS OF ALL KINDS AND THEIR POTENTIAL FOR VARIOUS THINGS RIGHT NOW THE'S A LOT OF EXCITEMENT ABOUT PSYCHODELICS IN THAT THER APEUTIC USES AND I THINK GREAT BUT AS A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE WHOS A PHYSICIAN CLINATION SAYS BETTER LIVING THROUGH CHEMISTRY STILL REQUIRES BETTER LIVING YOU CANNOT EXPECT TO TAKE A COMPOUND REGARDLESS OF SOURCE OR POTENCY AND HAVE IT COMPLETELY SHIFT YOUR EXPERIENCE OF LIFE WITHOUT HAVING TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN THE PROPER BEHAVIORS ALL THE THINGS WE KNOW PROPER SLEEP EXERCISE SOCIAL CONNECTION FOOD ET CETERA THE'RE MANY OTHERS AS WELL SO I STILL FIND THAT THIS COLLECTION OF STUDIES ABOUT A MEGA THREEDO MEGA SIX RATIOS TO BE PROFOUNDLY IMPORTANT SO MUCH SO THAT IT'S COMPLETELY CHANGE THE WAY THAT I THINK ABOUT FOOD THE FOODS I EAT I DO SUPPLEMENT I DON'T NOWSORLY THAT THINK THAT FOR EVERYBODY BUT I REALLY THINK IT'S INCREDIBLE THAT THERRE THESE COMPOUNDS THAT HAVE THESE ROBUST EFFECTS ON OUR FEELINGS OF WELL BEING AND THERE ARE OTHERS TO SO THAT THOUSAND MILEGRAM PER DAY THRESHOLD OF FISH OIL THATS BENEFICIAL REQUIRES THAT ONE TAKE YOU KNOW REASONABLE AMOUNT OF THESE THINGS EITHER THROUGH FOOD OR THROUGH SUPPLEMENTATION I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NOT EVERY ONE WANTS TO TAKE FISH OIL ON THEIRE COUPLE REASONS WHY ONE MIGHT WANT TO AVOID THAT A ONE WOULD BE FOR ETHICAL REASONS I YOU HAVE A AN EMOTIONAL RELATIONSHIP OR A A RELATIONSHIP TO THE ENVIRONMENT THAT MAKES YOU NOT WANT INJEST A FISH RELATED PRODUCTS THERE'S CRILL OIL CRILL A STILL AN ORGANISM AN TWILL TINYTHING THAT WALES EAT A LOT OF AND PEOPLE GENERALLY VERY LITTLE OF SO CRILL IS OUT THAT I PERSONALLY JUST ME I DON N'T KNOW WHY I DIDN'T RACKET WELL TO TO CRILL I DIDN'T MAKE ME FEEL VERY GOOD I HAD SOME LIKE CON OF SKIN EACH EESE AND THINGS LIKE THAT AM AND THEY STOPPED WHEN I STOP TAKING IT BUT I DON'T WANT TO BUIAS YOU AGAINST IT IF THAT'S YOUR PREFERENCE SOME PEOPLE REALLY LIKE CRILL OIL AS A SOURCE OF O MGA THREES I DID MENTION SOME OF THE OTHER SOURCES A LIKE CHIOCEDES AND FLAXIES BUT YOU'LL NOTICE THESE ARE NOT THINGS THAT WE TEND TIN JEST A LOT OF ON A REGULAR BASIS IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET OMEGATHREES FROM MEATS IF THE ANIMALS HAVE GRAZED ON GRASSES THAT CONTAIN A LOT OF OMEGA THREES AM SO FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT A INJEST MEAT NO YOU'R THE SOURCE OF THOSE MEATIT'S GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT AS IT RELATES STO MEGA THREES EVEN WITHIN THE CATEGORY OF FISHOIL THERE IS A CONCERN SOMETIMES ABOUT MERCURY AND OTHER CONTAMINANTS A YOU WANT TO GO WITH A BRAND THAT EMPHASIZES THAT THEYE A GONE TO REALLY GOOD SOURCES AND THAT THEY DECONTAMINATE A REGARDLESS AM AND SO YOU HAVE TO SEARCH OUT THOSE BRANDS THERE IS A TEST THAT YOU CAN DO AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THE FISHOIL IS A RANCED OR NOT  SOME PEOPLE TAKEIN LIQUID FORM SOME PEOPLE TAKING CAPISAL FORM THE LIQUID FORMS CAN BE MORE AFFORDABLE A THE CAPSAL FORM IT'S MORE A IS A LITTLE EASIER IN A MORE PORTABLE AM YOU CAN ACTUALLY JUST CHE A ONE OF THE A JEL TABLETS AND IF IT TASTES REALLY FISHING KIND ORANCID YOU'LL KNOW IT'S DISCUSTING YOU'LL WANT O SPITTED OUT AM AD IF IT DOESN'T AND IT'S TOLERABLE THEN YOU'LL KNOW THAT THAT IT'S OKA UNFORTUNE YOU HAVE TO BUY AT FIRST NOR TO DO THAT ALTHOUGH AM ANOM IF YOU CAN GET THEM TO OPEN UP THE BOTTLE FOR YOU IN THE STORE IN TELL THEM YOU DON'T WANT TO TRY IT IT I SOME DAY PERHAPS A FISHOIL IN A MEGA THREES IT'LL BE LIKE TASTING ONE A A RESTAURANT WERE YOU CAN SEND IT BACK FOR NOW I THINK YOU HAVE TO PURCHASE AT FIRST BUT FIND FIND A BRAND YOU TRUST AND LIKE AND THEN AND THEN WORK WITH THEM IF YOU DECIDE TO GO THAT ROOT OF COURSE THERE ARE OTHER COMPOUNDS THAT ARE ALSO INTERESTING FOR MOOD ELEVATION THAT ARE ESSENTIALLY LIKE FOODS OR ARE SUPPLEMENT BASED THAT NOW FORTUNATELY THERARE REALLY GOOD DATA FROM PUREVIEWED STUDIES AND THE NEXT ONE I WANT O MENTION CAUSE I THINK IT'S REALLY INTERESTING IS EL CARNATINE NOW EL CARNATINE IS BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME AND IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED IN THE CONTECTS OF HART HEALTH AND A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS HE WAS ASHALY INTOUT IS A BIT OF A WEIGHT LOST AGENT IN THE EARLY NINETIES BUT EL CARNATINE ACTUALLY HAS SOME REALLY IMPRESSIVE EFFECTS ON DEPRESSION AND AGAIN WE WILL LOOK TO PUBMED BECAUSE LOOKING AT EXAMINED OUT COMMANS ESSENTIALLY FOR ME ANYWAY LOOKING LIKE AT PUBMED WHAT IS EL CARNATINE LOKA EL CARNATINE IS MOST PREVALENT IN MEAT AND IN BEEF IN PARTICULAR NOW FOR THE VEGANS PLEASE KNOW THAT AL CARNATINE IS AVAILABLE THROUGH NON MEAT SOURCES AS WELL ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT AS ENRICHED IN NON MEAT SOURCES IT'S A REALLY INTERESTING MOLECULE BECAUSE ELSEEDAL EL CARNATINE IS ESSENTIALLY WHAT'S MADE FROM ELCARNATINE BUT IT'S A SEEDILATED IF YOUR INCEETEN THEABOUT CHEMISTRY CAN LOOK THAT UP IT'S A S ETILATED INTO A FORM THAT CAN CROSS THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER OR B B B IS A BARRIER TA WALL AROUND THE BRAIN AND YOU HAVE THIS BARRIER BECAUSE THE BRAIN IS SO IMPORTANT AND IT HAS THIS FEATURE THAT THE NURONS THERE DON'T RECREATE THEMSELVES AFTER INJURY LIKE OTHER ORGANS OF THE BODY THERE'S NOT A LOT TO TURN OVER OF CELLS DESPITE WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD AND SO NATURE HAS CREATED THIS B B B THIS BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER TO MAKE SURE THAT CERTAIN MOLECULES IN PARTICULAR LARGE MOLECULES DON'T GET ACROSS THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER CAUSE IT CAN BE DAMAGING TO THOSE TISSUES INCIDENTALLY YOU ALSO HAVE A VERY RIGID OR STRINGENT BARRIER AROUND OTHER ORGANS WHICH ARE THE GONE AT SO THE OVERIES AND THE TESTIS AND THE BRAIN ARE THE ORGANS OF THE BODY THAT THE THAT NATURE HAS GONE OUT OF ITS WAY TO PROTECT GIVE THIS ADDITIONAL LAYER OF THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER OR AS YOU MIGHT IMAGIN FOR THE TESTES AND THE OVERIES ITS CAN A BE THE BLOOD GONATTLE BARRIER SO THESE BARRIERS EXIST AND MAKE IT SUCH THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU EAT SOMETHING JUS BECAUSE YOU INJEST IT DOESN'T MEAN ITS CAN ACROSS THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER BUT AL CARNATINE WHEN TAKEN IS A SETILATED AND CONVERTED INTO THIS FORM THAT GETS A CROSS THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER AND IT HAS A LOT OF EFFECTS ITS INVOLVED AN MIGHTA CONDRUAL ACTIVATION A LONG CHAIN PHADIACIDS WHICH THAT'S A BIG MOUTHFUL OM WE GET INTO SOME TIME WHEN WE TIKE OUT METABOLICS BUT IT HAS SOME INTERESTING EFFECTS AT ON THE NURROW SIDE SO IF YOU DECIDE TO CHECK IT OUT UM ON EXAMINED OT COMULE SEE SOME REALLY INTERESTING THINGS LOTS OF EFFECTS ON AMONIA SEE REACTIVE PROTINES THINGS OF THAT SORT BLOOD GLUCOSTS IS LOWERED ET CETERA THAT'S ALLSTUFF THATS UM THE LEVEL BLOOD AN PERIFRY SLIGHT AFFECTS IN LOWER NG COLLESTER ALL UM HERE SOME INTERESTING ONES RATES OF PREGNANCY GO WAY UP WHEND PEOPLE ARE TAKING ALCARNATINE BOTH THE FATHER AND THE MOTHER BOTH THE SOURCE OF SPERM AND THE SOURCE OF EGG ARE EFFECTED IN WAYS THAT FAVOR PREGNANCY IT DOES INCREASE HERE WED GO AGAIN WITH SPIRM QUALITIES POR MOTILITY IN MALES AND IT SEEMS TO HAVE POSIVE EFFECTS ON FEMALES THAT HAVE POLYCISTIC OVERY CINDRA SO CHECK THAT OUT UM YOU KNOW THE EFFECTS ARE VARIE STRONG THEIRE THREE STUDIES LISTED THERE I GEN I'M NOT PROMOTING THIS BUT UM THAT THAT PEOPLE TAKE AL CARNATINE ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE TRYIN TO GET PREGNANT BUT UM CHECK IT OUT BECAUSE THE EFFECTS THERE AND THE STUDIES THAT ARE MENTIONED ARE UM PUBLISHED IN PURE REVIEWED RIGOROUS JOURNALS IN TERMS OF THE THE NURL EFFECTS THOSE ARE QUITE INTERESTING THE AFFECTS ON DEPRESSION ARE STILL EMERGING BUT THEY DO SEEM TO EXIST THAT PEOPLE FEEL A NOTABLE DECREASE IN DEPRESS OF SYMPTOMS THEIRE SEVEN STUDIES LISTED ON EXAMINED OUT CALM UM THAT HAS A NOTABLE BENEFIT IN VARIETY OF CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE PARTICIPANTS HAVE HEIGHTENED DEPRESSION ALREADY THEY START TAKING ALCARNATINE AND THEY START FEELING BETTER AND THEY TALK ABOUT DOSAGES IN THOSE VARIOUS STUDIES IT ALSO HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVING NOTABLE DECREASE IN THE SYMPTOMS OF AUTISM WHICH I FIND FASCINATING ALSO AGAIN THE THINGS WE INJEST IMPACT AR CHEMTHE CHEMICALS IN OUR BRAIN AND HOW THEY IMPACT THE REST OF OUR BODY THERE'S OTHER THINGS HAS BEEN USED TO TREAT CERTAIN FORMS OF ALCOHOL DEPENDENTS I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE A VERY EXCITING AND EMERGING AREA WE'RE GOIN NTO A WHOLE MONTH ABOUT A DICTION I'VE GOT A GREAT GUESS LINED UP FOR THAT MONTH BUT THERE'S NOW IN EMERGING FIELD ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE CAN TAKE AN SUPPLEMENT TO HELP EASE THE CRAVINGS AND THE WITHDRAWAL WHEN TRYING TO QUIT DRUGS OF ABUSE LIKE COCANE ALCOHOL HEROINE AND SMOKING AND THINGS OF THAT SORT SO REALLY INTERESTING A AREA THIS IS I LIKE TO THINK IS EARLY DAYS AND WERE GOING TOSCOVER A LOT MORE THERE'S A HUGE LIST OF THINGS HERE SINCE WE TALKED ABOUT PAIN ON A PREVIOUS EPISODE AND I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE AM HAVE WRITEN TO ME ABOUT FIBR MIALGIA IT DOES EL CARNTINE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE SYMPTOMS OF FIBRA MIALGIA AGAIN ALL THE LINKS TO STUDIES ARE ON EXAMINED OUT CALM TOTAL TOTALLY FREE SIGHT AND THAT WAS MY BULLDOG BEING A BATTERING RAM THERE'S NOTHING GRACEFUL ABOUT THIS BULLDOG HE'S OCIDY ON TO LEAVE TO GO TO DRINK WATER AND SO PLEASE FORGIVE THE NOISE OK SO NOW LET'S TURN TO ANOTHER ASPECT OF THE GOT BRAIN RELATIONSHIP THAT WE'LL SURPRISE YOU IN SOME CASES MIGHT SHOCK YOU AND THAT HAS SOME REALLY COOL AND ACTIONABLE BIOLOGY AND THATS THE GOT MICROBIUM PROBIOTICS AND PREBIOTICS I KNOW TODAY WERE TALKING ABOUT EMOTIONS AND NOT PAIN BUT I BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T MENTION ANOTHER EFFECT OF A SEADALAL CARNATINE THAT'S BEEN REPORTED AND THAT YOU CAN FIND LISTED WITH LINK TO STUDY ON EXAMINED OUT CALM WHICH IS IT'S EFFECT IN REDUCING THE SYMPTOMS OF MY GRAIN THIS WAS A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL WITH A HUNDRE AND THIRTY THREE PARTICIPANTS WHO HAD FREQUENT MIGRAINS THEY WERE TAKING FIVE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF ALCARNATINE WERE NOTHING FOR TWELVE WEEKS SO THE CONTROL IS A LITTLE BIT O THE CONTROL EXPERIMENT THEREIS WILL BUT TRICKY BUT IT HAD A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON REDUCING THE NUMBER OF MIGRAN ANTACX PER MONTH SO I FIND THAT REALLY INTERESTING THERE'S A LOT MORE ELISTED THERE ABOUT THE STUDY AM AND I THINK THESE COMPOUNDS ARE POWERFUL A THEY CARRY RISKS FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE NOT FOR OTHERS SO AGAIN YOU HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT'S RIGHT FOR YOU BUT I DO THINK THEY ARE SUPERINTERESTING AS A POTENTIAL THERAPEUTICS FOR VARIOUS PEOPLE SO WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH THE GOT MICROBIOM AND THE GOT BRAIN AXIS TO DAY WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN TALKING A LOT ALREADY ABOUT THE GOT BRAIN AXIS THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MICROBIUMS WE'VE BEEN TIE BOUT THIS VAGUEST NERVE THAT CONNECS PROVIDING SENSORY INFORMATION FROM THE BODY TO THE BRAIN AND THEN THE BRAIN ALSO SENDS IN THE SAME NERVE MOTOR INFORMATION TO CONTROL THE MOTILITY THET GOT THE HEART RAT HOW FAST WE BREATHE DEPLOYMENT OF A MUNE STUFF KILLER CELLS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT BUT OFTENTIMES WHEN WE HEAR ABOUT THE GUT BRAIN AXIS THESE DAYS IT'S A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE GUT MICROBIOM AND ONCE AGAIN WERE IN A SITUATION WHERE THERE'S INCREDIBLE BIOLOGY I'M VERY HAPPY THERE'S SO MUCH DISCUSSION ABOUT THE GUT MICROBIOM I AM SOMEWHAT DISMAYED AND CONCERNED THAT MOST OF WHAT I HEAR OUT THERE IS EITHER FALSE OR PARTIALLY FALSE SO WORE GOIN TO CLEAR UP SOME OF THE MISCONCEPTIONS FIRST BY UNDERSTAND THE BIOLOGY AND THEN OREGAN TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE ACTIONABLE ITEMS IT IS TRUE THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF THESE LITTLE MICRO MICRO ORGANISMS LIVING IN OUR GUT THEY ARE NOT THERE BECAUSE THEY WANT TO HELP US THEY DON'T HAVE BRAINS THEY ARE ADAPTIVE HOWEVER THEY TRY IN FIND AND CREATE INVIRONMENTS THAT MAKE IT EASIER FOR THEM TO PROLIFERATE SO THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU AND ME BUT THEY ARE PERFECTLY WILLING TO EXPLOIT YOU AND ME IN ORDER TO MAKE MORE OF THEMSELVES THE SAME WAY VIRUSES ARE VIRUSES DON'T HAVE A MIND THEY INFACT CELLS THEY HIGJACT THE GENOM AND THEY USE THAT GENOM TO MAKE MORE OF THEMSELVES THE MICROBIODA THAT LIVE IN US VERY ALONG THE LENGTH OF OUR DIGESTIVE TRACT BUT LETS JUS TAKE A STEP BACK AND THINK ABOUT HOW OUR BODY PLAN IS MADE WE ARE ACTUALLY A SERIES OF TUBES OUR BRAIN AS ACTUALLY A TUBE YOU SEE IT'S ALL SQUISHY ON THE OUTSIDE AND THEN'S GOT THAT LONG THING THE SPINAL CORD THAT GOES DOWN TO THE BASE OF THE SPINE THAT'S THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT ALL STARTED OUT AS A TUBE IT JUST LOOKS LIKE A COLLY FLOWER ON THE OTHER END UP IN THE BRAIN BECAUSE THEY TUBE IS SO BIG AND HAS TO BE CRAMMED INTO THE SKULL SO IT GETS ALL WRINKLED UP BUT IF WE WERE TO SPLAY IT OUT YOU'D FIND THAT JUST ONE BIG TUBE SIMILARLY ARE DIGESTIVE TRACT IN OUR AIRWAYS ARE ESSENTIALLY ONE BIG TUBE IT STARTS WITH OUR MOUTH ALSO OUR NOSE AND THEN WE HAVE ALL THESE OTHER TUBES THAT GO DOWN THROUGH OUR THROAT AND THEN INTO OUR STOMACH AND THEN INTO OUR VERIOUS INTESTINS AND THAN THE TUBE ENDS OUT THE OTHER END SO WE ARE ONE LONG TUBE FOR DIGESTION AND INSIDE OF THAT TUBE IS A MUCOSAL LINING IS THESE LITTLE MICROVILI TINY TINY TINY LITTLE LIKE VELVETY ENDS OF CELLS THAT ARE ABLE TO MOVE AND MOVE THINGS ALONG AND MUCUS MUCOSA AND THE CONDITIONS OF THAT MUCOSA LINING SET A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS IT SETS THE RATE OF OUR DIGESTION AND THE QUALITY OF OUR DIGESTION IT SETS FOR INSTANCE OUR MUNE SYSTEM I MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY DON'T REALIZE US BUT MOST INFECTIONS IN THE ENVIRONMENT WE'LL HAVE TO GET IN OUR BODY SOMEHOW SOME OF THEM ARE INHALED A LOT OF THEM GOING TO OUR MOUTH AND LODGE IN THE MUCOSAL LINING OF THE MOUTH AND THEN INFECTION START THERE THEY PROBABLY HAD THE EXPERIENCE UNFORTUNATELY IVE YOU KNOW FEEING LIKE Y HAVE ARTICING YOUR THROAT LIKE SOMETHINGS IRRITATING YOUR THROAT AND THEN IT KIND OF MIGRATE UP INTO A HEAD COLD OR RUNNY KNOWS SOMETIMES TEL STARS ATHEADACHE SOMETIMES IT WON'T BUT THINGS THAT ARE IN OUR CAN MIGRATE DOWN INTO THE GUT SO WE'RE NJESTING THINGS ALL THE TIME THING ABOUT AIR BA BACTERIA VIRASES THEY'RE MAKING THEIR WAY INTARGUT AND SOME OF THOSE VACTORIA LIVE IN THE GUT AND SOME OF THOSE BACTERIA BIUS THE MUCOSAL LINING IN THE GUT STOMACH AN INTESTINS TO BE MORE ACITIC OR MORE BASIC SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE MORE OF THEMSELVES SO THEY CAN REPLICATE THEY LIKE A PARTICULAR COMFORT ITS LIKE THEY LIKE A PARTICULAR KIND OF BEDDING TO LIE DOWN IN AN CREATE MORE THEMSELVES NOW SOME OF THOSE MUCOSAL LININGS THAT THEY PROMOTE MAKE US FEEL BETTER THEY MAKE US FEEL MORE ALERT THEY BOLSTER ARMUNSISTEM AND OTHERS MAKE US FEEL WORSE SO FIRST RULE THE MICROBIOM IS IN GOOD OR BAD SOME OF THESE LITTLE BUGS THAT LIVE IN US DO BAD THINGS TUS THEY MAKE US FEEL WORSE THEY LOWER OUR MUNITY THEY AFFECT US IN NEGATIVE WAYS SOME OF THEM MAKE US FEEL BETTER AND THEY DO THAT MAINLY BY CHANGING CHANGING THE CONDITIONS OF OURE GUT ENVIRONMENT IN ADDITION TO THAT THEY DO IMPACT THE NEURO TRANSMITTERS AND THE NURONS THAT LIVE IN THE GUT AND THAT SIGNAL UP TO THE BRAIN TO IMPACT THINGS LIKE DOPAMEN AND CERATONAN THAT WE'VE BEN TALKING ABOUT PREVIOUSLY SO THERE'S A VAST WORLD NOW DEVOTED TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND WHAT SOURCES OF FOOD WHAT KINDS OF FOODS ARE GOOD OR NOT GOOD FOR THE GUT MICROBIOM SOLICIOUS TALK ABOUT SOME GENERAL RULES OF THUMB RELATED TO THE RESEARCH QUALITY RESEARCH THAT'S PURE REVIEWED AND THEN IN A FUTURE EPISODE WE WILL GO FAR DEEPER INTO THE GUT MICROBIUM AND GUT BRAIN AXIS BUT HERE'S OF FEW THINGS THAT I THINK YOU MIGHT FIND SURPRISING FIRST OF ALL SUPPORTING A HEALTHY GUT MICROBIOM IS GOOD FOR MOOD GREAT FOR DIGESTION AND GREAT FOR A MUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION HOWEVER THAT DOES NOT MEAN MAXING OUT OR TAKING THE MOST PROBIOTIC AND PREBOTIC THAT YOU CAN POSSIBLY MANAGE SI MENTION MANY TIMES BEFORE I DO BELIEVE IN AND PROBIOTICS I TAKE PROBITICS BUT THERE ARE STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT IF YOU TAKE LOTS AND LOTS OF CERTAIN PROBIOTICS LIKE LACK TO BASILIS AND YOU REALLY RAMP UP THE LEVELS MORE IT IS NOT A CASE OF MORE IS BETTER THERE ARE THINGS LIKE BRAINFOG THAT CAN COME FROM THAT BRAINFOG IS JUST AS INABILITY TO FOCUS PEOPLE FEEL REALLY NOT WELL GENERALLY SOME OF THOSE STUDIES ARE ELOBIT CONTROVERSIAL BUT I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT IF PEOPLE REALLY INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF PROBIOTIC THAT THEY'RE TAKING BEYOND A CERTAIN AMOUNT THAN THEY START FEELING FOGGY IN THE MIND NOW WHAT'S TOO MUCH WELL I GET PROBIOTICS FROM I VENTURNED BEFORE FROMU LET AGREE INS YOU CAN GET THEM FROM FERMENTED FOODS LIKE A SOUR CROUD A PICKLES CIMCHEE NOTOIS THESE ARE DIFFERENT SOURCES FROM AROUND THE WORLD A AC CHE HAD LOVE TO HEAR SOME OF THE OTHER SOURCES THAT PEOPLE KNOW OTHER FOODS FROM AROUND THE WORLD I'M FASCINATED BY THE WAY IN WHICH DIFFERENT CULTURES HAVE ALL A ARRIVED AT THESE A FOODS THAT PROBIDE AND SUPPORT HEALTHY MICROBIOMS BECAUSE THEIR FERMENTED AI'VE A COLLEAGUEAT STAMPHORD JUST IN SONIMBERG HE AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS I DON'T A WANT A QUOTE HIM A INAPPROPRIATELY A BUT YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS BON THEY'VE PUBLISH THAT THE INGESTION OF FERMENTED FOODS IS ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO SUPPORT HEALTHY LEVELS OF GOT MICROBIO BIODA A WITHOUT EXCEEDING THE THRESHOLD THAT WOULD CAUSE THINGS LIKE BRAIN FOG SO FOODS AND FERMENTED FOODS ARE GOING TO BE THE BEST SOURCE AND A THERE ARE A NUMBER DIFFERENT WAYS THAT ONE COUN DO THAT SOME PEPLE DON'T LIKE FERMENTED FOODS HOWEVER SOME PEOPLE SUPPLEMENTIT SO IT ISN'T TA CASE OF MORE IS BETTER SO WE KNOW THAT THE OTHER IS THAT IT IS TRUE THAT HEALTHY GOT MICROBIOTA HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE SYMPTEMS OF CERTAIN A PSYCHIATRIC ILNESSES AS WELL AS CERTAIN CONDITIONS LIKE PARTICULAR FEATURES ALONG THE OUTISM SPECTRUM WHICH IS INTERESTING AND THOSE EFFACTS ARE PROBABLY DUE TO NOTCOUST IMPROVEMENT OF A MUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION BUT TO THE THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE NURONS THAT SENSE NUTRIENTS CONVEY INFORMATION TO THE BRAIN AND INCREASE LEVELS OF CERETONEN AND ORDOPOMINE SO GOT MICROBIOM PROVIDES KIND OF A FOUNDATION FOR HEALTHY GOT IN HEALTHY GOT BRAIN AXIS SO MUCH SO THAT SOME PEOPLE REPORT THAT WHEN THEY START EATING SMALL BITS CAUSE DOESN'T REQUIRE LOT OF FERMENTED FOODS THAT THERE OVER ALL MOOD IS BETTER NOT UNLIKE THE EFFECTS OF EP LTHOUGH I DON'T THINK IT'S BEEN LOOKED AT DIRECTLY IN THE CONTEXT OF CLINICAL DEPRESSION YET AND A IF SOME ONE KNOWS OF A STUDY PLEASE MENTION IN THE COMMENTS THAT WOULD BE TERRIFIC THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO TO REALLY DAMAGEOUR GOT MICROBIO AND THIS IS WHERE THERE'S A HUGE MISCONCEPTION THAT I WANT A CLEAR UP THRE 'S A STUDY THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN NATURE WHICH IS AMONG THE THREE TOP JOURNALS THAT WE HAVE IN SCIENCE YO NATURE SCIENCE AND CELL ARE CONSIDERED THE TOP TOPS BUT EXCELLENT JOURNAL THAT SHOWED THAT ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS BUT AT PARTICULAR ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER WHICH WAS SACREN CAN DISERRUPT THE GOT MICROBIOM IN WAYS THAT IS DETRIMENTAL TO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT HEALTH MARKERS INCREASING IN FLAMATORY SIDA KINDS AND ALL THE OTHER BAD THINGS THAT HAPPEN WHEN A THE GOT MICROBIOM IS THROWN OFF KILTER THAT STUDY WAS WIDELY DISCUSSED BUT THERE ARE FEW THINGS THAT WERE NOT MENTION THERE THAT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT THAT STUDY WAS ABOUT SACRIN IN PARTICULAR SACREN IS NOT THE MOST TYPICAL ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER THAT'S USE THE MOST TYPICAL SWEETEN ER ARTIFICIAL SWEETNERS THEIRE USED ARE THINGS LIKE ASPERTAME SO CALLED NEUTRO SUEET OR SUCROLOS OR THESE DAY STIVIA THERS MONK FRUITS TO MY KNOWLEDGE AND PLEASE CORRECT ME IF ANYONE KNOWS OF ANY STIDIES TO MY KNOWLEDGE THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF THESE ARTIFICIALS OF ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS ON THE GOT MICROBIUM WERE RESTRICTED TO SACRON NOW THERE IS ENOUGH CHEMICAL SIMILARITY BETWEEN SACRON AND SOME OF THE OTHER ONES THAT I MENTION BUT NOT ALL OF THEM FOR INSTANCE STEVIA MONK FRUIT ARE DISTINCT IN THEIR CHEMICAL MAKE UP SO THAT THEY PROBABLY DON'T HAVE IF THEY HAVE ANY HAVE LOWER EFFECTS NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE GUT MICROBIM BUT IT SHOULD STILL BE TESTED SO SACRAN IS REALLY OF IT WAS SHOWN IN THIS STUDY IN SEVERAL OTHER STUDIES CAN REALLY NEGATIVELY INFACT A IMPACT EXCUSE ME THE QUALITY OF THE GOP MICROBIOM INTERESTINGLY THE NARRATIVE AROUND ARTIFICIAL SWEETNRS AND GOT MICROBIOM IS INCORRECT MOST PEOPLE THOUGHT O SACRON IS BAD FOR THE MICROBIOM IT MUST KILL THE MICROBIOM AND SO YOU HEAR PEOPLE SAYING OHENO ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS KILL THE MICROBIOM THAT'S NOT TRUE AT ALL IN FACT IN THAT VERY SAME STUDY PUBLISH IN NATURE THEY SHOWED THAT THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF SACRON ON THE MICROBIOM COULD BE BLOCKED OR ELIMINATED BY GIVING ANTIBIODICTS SO WHAT HAPPENS IS CERTAIN ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS IN PARTICULAR SACRON DISRUPT THE MICROBIOM AND MAKE THE ENVIRONMENT WITHIN THE GUT THAT MUCOSAL LINING MORE FAVORABLE TO TO BACTURIA MICROBIODA THAT ARE NOT GOOD FOR THE ORGANISM CAN THIS IS AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION IT'S NOT JOUST THAT A LANGUAGE THING WORD PEOPLE SAY OH YOU KNOW IT IT KILLS THE MICROBIUM IT DOESN'T KILL THE MICROBIUM IT SHIFTS THE MICROBIOM AND SHIFTS IN THE MICROBUM CAN BE GOOD OR THEY CAN BE BAD AND THAT TAKES US TO ANOTHER TOPIC THAT'S A BIT OF A HOT BUTTON TOPIC BUT I'M WILLING TO GO THERE CAUSE I THINK IT DESERVES CONVERSATION WHICH IS NOWADAYS THERE ARE MANY OM EXAMPLES OUT THERE WERE PEOPLE HAVE SWITCHED FROM A KIND OF STANDARD DIET OR OF EVEN A VEGETARIAN DIET TO A OR VIGANDIE TO AQUITO DIET NOW QUITO DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO MEAN THE INGESTION A MEATS BUT IT CAN AND THEY EXPERIENCE POSITIVE EFFECTS FOR THEMSELVES NOT EVERYBODY AND I'VE TALHT PREVIOUSLY ABOUT SOME OF THE OM KIND OF THE A INCORRECT WHAT I BELIEVE IS IN CORRECT MARKETING OF QUITO AS IT RELATES THE THE COSMETIC EFFECTS AND SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WITH SLEEP THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE BUT SOME PEOPLE LOVE QUITONE IT WORKS GREAT FOR THEM BUT THE QUITOGENIC DIET IS INTERESTING BECAUSE WHEN ONE SHIFTS TO THE QUITOGENIC DIET THERE IS A SHIFT IN THE GOP MICROBIUM AND SOME PEOPLE LEND UP FEELING BETTER SOME PEOPLE AND UP FEELING WORSE LIKEWISE SOME PEOPLE GO FROM INGESTING ANIMAL PRODUCTS INCLUDING MEAT OR THEIR VEGETARIAN AND THEY GO TO VIGAN AND THEY EXPERIENCE POSITIVE SHIFTS IN MOOD AND AFFECT AND WE KNOW THAT THE THAT THE TRANSITION TO A MORE PLANTBASE DIET AND ESPECIALLY THE ENRICHMENT OF FIBRE THAT PRESENT IN THOSE DIETS ALSO CREATES DRAMATIC SHIFTS IN THE GUT MICROBIO SOME PEOPLE FEEL BETTER DOING THAT SOME PEOPLE FEEL WORSE AND OF COURSE IT'S GOING TO DEPEND ON WHETHER NOT YOUR INGESTING LOT OF PROCES FOODS ARE NOT THERE WAS A PAPER PUBLISHED IN CELL A SELL PRESSTEURNAL OBVIOUSLY EXCELLENT JOURNAL SHOWING THAT INGESTION OF PROCESS FOODS REGARDLESS OF WHETHEROR NOT THEY COME FROM ANIMAL SOURCES ARE NON ANIMAL SOURCES THE PROCESS FOODS THEMSELVES TEND TO CREATE ACTIVITY WITHIN THE BODY AND THIS SURELY HAS ROOTS IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT LEAD TO OVER CONSUMPTION OF CALORIES AND WEIGHT GAIN EVEN SOME WAKIN THAT COULDN'T BE EXPLAINED BY INCREASE CALORIES IN OTHER WORDS PROCESS FOODS ARE BAD REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE TALKING BYUT ANIMAL PRODUCTS ORE NON ANIMAL PRODUCTS PROBABLY NOT SURPRISING NOW GIVENG WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT THESE SUGAR SENSING ANOTHERS I MENOACID SENSING SELLS IN THE GUT THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER SO THE POINT OF ALL THIS IS THAT WHEN I SAY YOU HAVE TO FIND WHAT'S RIGHT FOR YOU THAT'S NOT A THROWAWAY STATEMENT SOME PEOPLES MICROBIOM AND THE LINING OF THEIR OF THEIR MUCOSA THEM ME EXCUSE ME THE MCOSA LINING OF THEIR OF THEIR THROAT OF THEIR GOD OF THEIR KNOS EVERYTHING IS IMPROVED BY DIETSTHAT ARE HEAVILY MEAT BASED AND DON'T HAVE MANY PLANTS OTHER PEOPLE DO MUCH BETTER ON A PLANTBASE DIET WITHOUT MANY MEAT PRODUCTS OR ANIMAL PRODUCTS IT'S HIGHLY INDIVIDUAL AND THIS PROBABLY HAS ROOTS AN GENETIC MAKE UP THIS PROBABLY HAS ROOTS IN WHAT PEOPLE WERE RAIZED ON BECAUSE REMEMBER THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF COURSE IS SET UP BY YOUR GENET YOUR GENES ARE GENETIC PROGRAM BUT YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IT ADAPS EARLY IN LIFE TO YOUR CONDITIONS THAT'S WHAT IT'S FOR THE REASON YOU HAVE A NERVOUS SYSTEM IS TO MOVE YOUR YOUR BODY APPROPRIATELY TOWARDS THINGS THAT ARE GOOD FOR YOU AND AWAY FROM THINGS THAT ARE NOT BUT ALSO THE IT WAS DESIGNED TO ADAPT THE EARLY LIFE PERIOD HAS THIS INCREDIBLE THING ABOUT PLASTICITY THAT WE SPENT A WHOLE MONTH ON SO THAT IT CAN CHANGE SO THAT YES INDEED SOME PEOPLE MAY LIKE CERTAIN FOODS IND REACT A CERTAIN FOODS BETTER THAN OTHERS BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THEIR NERVOUS SYSTEM WAS WIRE THIS ENTERIC AS IT'S CALLED NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT LINES THE GUD IN THAT COMMUNICATES WITH THE BRAIN SO MOST OF WHAT IHAVE TALKED ABOUT TO DAY IS AND OF A BLACK AND WHITE THESE ARE THINGS THAT AT PRESENT IN ALL OF US THE SUGAR SENSING YOUR ONS OF THE GUT THE WAY THE VAGES IS WIRED THE FACT THAT OMEGATHREOMEGASIX S TEND TO IMPROVE THAT THE RATIOS TEND TO IMPACT MOOD WITH HIOMEGATHREOMEGASIX RATIOS IMPROVING MOOD WE TALKED ABOUT ALLSORTS OF THINGS IN THE GUT BRAIN AND BODY BRAIN ACIS BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE MICROBIOM THE KEY THING IS THAT WE ALL HAVE A MICROBIOM YOU WANT A MICROBIOM BUT YOU WANT TO PROMOTE THE MICROBIOUM THAT IS RIGHT FOR YOU AND THAT CAN BE SHIFTED AND STEERED BY INGESTING CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF FOODS AND NOT OTHERS AND ONE THING THAT REALLY FRUSTRATES ME IS WHEN THAT PEOPLE SHOW UP WITHIN A GENDA LIKE YOU KNOWA ALL MEAT TO GENDA OR A VIGANAGEND OR AQUITOAGENDA AND THEY TALK ABOUT THESE POSIVE EFFECTS ON THE GUT MICRO BIOM AND IT'S ALL TRUE FRANKLY AND SO IT'S HIGHLY INDIVIDUAL NOW THIS DOESN'T GET TO ANY OF THE ETHICAL ISSUES AROUND ANIMALS ARE THE PLANET OR AM AND YOU HEAR RABBID DEBATES ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW ON BOSIDES UM AND I AM NOT A QUALIFIT AR EQUIPPED TO TALK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU KNOW REGENER VOUC GRECULTURER ANIMAL PRODUCTS OR FARMING AR ANY THESE THINGS HOW THOSE ACTUALLY IMPACT THE ENVIRONMENT THAT IS NOT MY EXPERTICE BUT WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR HEALTH AND YOUR MICROBIOM YOU WANT A SUPPORT THE MICROBIOM IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THESE FERMENTED FOOD SUPPORT THE MICROBIOM THAT WE SHOULD BE INGESTING AT LEAST TWO SERVINGS PER DAY WHICH IS QUITE A LOT THAT SUPPLEMENTATION AT LOW LEVELS CAN BE GOOD SUPPLEMENTATION AT HIGH LEVELS CAN CREATE THIS BRAINFOG EVEN THOUGH SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT RESULT IS CONTROVERSIAL I'VE EXPERIENCES MYSELF AND THE DATA LOOK TO ME PRETTY DARN SOLID SO THAT'S ONE THING TO THINK ABOUT AS WELL AND THE OTHER THING ABOUT THE GOT MICRBIOM IS T IT'S HIGHLY CONTACTUAL BASED ON OTHER THINGS THAT YOURE DOING SO EVEN THINGS LIKE EXERCISE AND SOCIAL WELL BEING AND CONNECTION THOSE THINGS ARE ALSO IMPACTING THE GUP MICROBIUM SO FIND THE DIET THAT'S RITE FOR YOU AN THAT WORKS FOR YOU IN THE CONTECT OF THE OTHER ETHICAL AND LIFESTOUT CHOICES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO YOU THAT'S MY ADVICE A NOTE ABOUT FASTING I HAVE A COLLIGUE AT YALE WHO'S AN EXPERT IN THE GUT MICROBIOM AND HE TELD ME SOMETHING REALLY INTERESTING WHICH IS WHEN WE FAST WE ACTUALLY DIGEST CERTAIN COMPONENTS WITHIN OUR DIETARY TRACT IT ACTUALLY DEPLETES A GOOD AMOUNT OF THE GUP MICROBIOM AND THIS IS INTERESTING IVE I'VE HAD GOOD OF RESULTS FROM I GUESS YOU WOULD CALL IT INTERMITTENT OR KIND OF CIRCADIAN TIPE FASTING WHERE IVE NEVER DONE LONG FAST BUT WHERE I PUSH OUT MY FIRST MEAL BY A FEW HOURS MY FIRST MEALS GENERALLY ROUND LUNCH TIME OR SO A BUT THE LONGER PERIODS OF FASTING THEY GO FOR A DAY OR TWO OR THREE DAYS ARE KNOWN TO DEPLETE THE GOT MICROBIOM IN MAJOR WAYS AND BUT THAT'S NOT ALWAYS NESARELY A BAD THING BECAUSE WHEN IT'S REPLENISHED IT OFTEN IS REPLENISHED AT LEVELS THAT EXCEEDED ITS PREVIOUS LEVEL BUT I THINK THAT SOME OF THE A GE I TRACT AND EVEN SOME OF THE MENTAL EFFECTS OF RETURNING TO EATING AFTER FEATING SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T FEEL SO GOOD WHEN THEY STAR INE THEY REALLY WANT FOOD BUT THEN THY STARTINIG AND THEY DON'T FEEL AS GOOD AS THEY DID ON THE FAST SOME OF THAT MAY BE RELATED TO THE DEPLETION OF THE MICROBIUM THAT OCCURS DURING LONG FAST SO AGAIN THIS IS SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT AND TALK ABOUT WITH YOUR DOCTOR BUT AH THE IDEA THAT FASTING ACROSS THE BOARD IS IS GOOD A THERE MAY BE SOME MERITS TO THAT AND CERTAINLY IN SOME CASES BUT IT DOES DEPLETE THE MICROBIOM AND THAT DEPLETION OF THE MICROBIOM IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT MEANS WHEN YOU RETURN TO EATING YOU ARE ACTUALLY NOT IN THE SAME POSITION TO DIGEST AN A SIMILATE THOSE FOODS AND THOSE FOODS ARE NOT IN THOSE SAME POSITION TO IMPACT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY THE SAME WAY THEY WERE PRIOR TO THE FAST THIS AS I THINK WHY PEOPLE SUGGEST A KIND OF GRADUAL TRANSITION BACK TO I CONSUMING NEUTRANS AFTER A FAST SO AS WE ROUND UP BY ONE OF SHARESOME RESULTS WITH YOU THAT WITHOUT QUESTION WILL IMPACT THE WAY THAT YOU RESPOND TO FOOD MENTALLY AND EVEN PHYSICALLY AND I KNOW THAT BECAUSE THAT'S THE CENTRAL THEME OF THE STUDIES I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU ABOUT I HAVE A COLLYU GET STAMFORD A LEA CRUM WHO'SE DONE SOME REMARKABLE EXPERIMENTS ON MIND SET AND SOME PEOPLE COULD THING ABOUT THESE AS PLACIBO EFFACTS OR BELIEF EFFECTS BUT THEY ICTIULY GO WAY BEYOND THOSE TERMS AND THERE ARE NUMBER OF DIFERENT EXAMPLES OF THIS THAT A LEA'S LAB AND HER COWORKERS HAVE DEMONSTRATED BUT TWO THAT ARE PARTICULARLY INTERESTING TO ME I WANT A SHARE WITH YOU NOW BECAUSE THEY REALLY EMPHASIZE HOW OUR BELIEFS CAN REALLY MPACT THE WAY THAT OUR BRAIN AND BODY WORK TOGETHER I THINK THE MOST FAMOUS OF THESE IS AN EXPERIMENT THEY DID WHERE THEY HAD TWO GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS THEY WERE EACH GIVEN A MILKSHAKE AND THEY HAD SOME FACTORS MEASURED FROM THEIR BLOOD BY AN IVY WHILE THEY INJESTED THE MILKSHAKEN THAN AFTERWARDS AS WELL AND ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT THEY WERE LOOKING AT WAS SOMETHING ALL GREELAND G H ARE YE L I AND GREELAND IS A PEPTIDE THAT IT INCREASES WITH HUNGER S THE LONGER YOUHAVE AN ETEN THAT GREELAN GOES UP AND I KNOW SOME OF YOU SAY WELL Y FAST I FAST I FASTEN EVENTULLY LOSE MY APPETITE WHILE GREELAND STILL GOES UP AND THEN IT DROP SO IF YOU ON TESE PEOPLE THAT EATS EVERY THREE HOURS REGULARLY GREELAND KIND OF GETS A TTE PULSE AS YOU GET TO THAT TWO HOUR AND FIFTY MINUTE MARK SO IT'S AL A BIT OF A TIMER AS WELL TS REALLY INTERESTING PEPTIDE IN ANY EVENT WHAT THEY DID IS THEY GAVE PEOPLE MILKSHKES TWO GROUPS ONE GROUP GOT A SHAKE THAT THEY WERE TOLD WAS A LOW CALORY HEALTHY SHKE THE OTHER GROUP GOT A MILKSHAKE THAT THEY WERE TOLD WAS THE VERY DECTEDAND HIGH CALORY SHAKE I THINK IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE TWO ORE MAYBE VEN TWO AND HALFTIMES AS MANY CALORIES AS THE OTHER PERHAPS EVEN MORE  DON'T RECALL THE DETAILS BUT YOU HAD A HIGH CALORY IN A LOWCALORY CONDITION AND THEN THEY DRANK THE SHAKE AND THEN THEY MEASURED GREELAN IN THESE SUBJECTS BLOOD AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT THE HIGH CALORY SHAKE HAD A MUCH MORE ROBUST EFFECT ON BLUNTING GREELAND AND REDUCING GREELAN BUT THE INTERESTING THING YOU PROBABLY GUESSED ALREADY IS THAT IT WAS THE EXACT SAME SHAKE GIVEN TO BOTH GROUPS SO PEOPLES BELIEF ABOUT THE CONTENT OF SOMETHING IMPACTED THEIR PHYSIOLOGY IN A AND THIS SPEAKS TO THESE SO CALL TOP DOWN MECHANISMS ARE MODULATION OF OUR PHYSIOLOGY AN PREVIOUS EPISODE ABOUT PAIN WE TALKED ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF YOU KNOW OF OBSESSIVE BELIEVE NOT IT WAS OUNT OF OBSESSIVE IMFATUATION AND LOVE ON PAIN RESPONSES AND PAIN THRESHOLDS THIS IS YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE WHERE BELIEFS WERE SUBJECTIVE FEELINGS CAN IMPACT PHYSIOLOGY AT THE LEVEL OF THE PERIFERY BECAUSE GREELANESS IS RELEASED IN THE PERIFERY IN THE BODY NOW THESE BELIEF EFFECTS EXTEND BEYOND EXAMPLES LIKE THIS ANOTHER GOOD EXAMPLE THAT I LIKE TO SHARE IS A ALLY DOCTOR CRUM AND HER COLLEAGUES DID A AN EXPERIMENT WHERE THEY TOOK A HOUSEKEEPERS HOTEL THEY WERE SENTURY HOTEL WORKERS DIVIDE THEM INTO TWO GROUPS THEY HAD THE WATCH A SHORT FILM IN ONE CASE THE FILM WAS ABOUT HOW YOU KNOW THEIR WORK WAS IMPORTANT T HELP PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE IN THE HOTEL ET CETERA ET CETERA THE OTHER GROUP HEARD THAT THE ACTIVITY THAT THEY WERE DOING CLEANING AND TAKING CARE OF THE HOTEL WAS GOOD FOR THEM IT WAS GOOD FOR THEIR HEALTH ET CETER ET CETERA THEY CONTROLLED VERY NICELY IN THE STUDY FOR HEALTH PERAMETERS FOR INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCE IS AND FOR THE BEHAVIORS OF THESE PEOPLE IN THE PERIOD THAT FOLLOWED THIS SHORT TUTORIAL AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS EIGHT WEEKS LATER THE GROUP THAT HAD BEEN TOLD THAT THE ACTIVITY WAS GOOD FOR THEM SHOWED LOWER BLOOD PRESSURE THEY AD LOST A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF BODY FACT AND THEY REPORTED EXENJOYING THEIR WORK FAR MORE THAN THE OTHER GROUP THE SAME WORK SIMPLY BIASD MENTALLY BY THE INFORMATION THAT THEY WERE GIVEN BUT THEIR PHYSIOLOGY FOLLOWED THAT INFORMATION AND SO THIS IS NOT JUST THE PLACIBO EFFECT THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE SEID OF FINDINGS THAT ILLUSTRATE THE EXTENT TO WHICH WHETHER NOT WE BELIEVE A FOOD IS GOING TO BE GOOD FOR US OR NOT GOOD FOR US WELL WE CAN'T ESCAPE THE REALITY YOU CAN'T TELL YOURSELF THAT A POISON IS GOING TO BE GOOD FOR YOU AND IN JUST THAT POISON EXPECTED DO NOT KILL YOU NOR CAN YOU TELL YOURSELF THE EATING YOU KNOW A TWELVE CRESSANTS CONFESS I DON IT IT WAS AFTER A VERY LONG RUN ALONG TIME AGO BUT YOU CAN'T TELL YOURSELF THAT THAT'S NECESSARILY GOING TO BE GOOD FOR YOU OR THAT ITS CAN MAKE YOU LOOSE WEIGHT THESE BELIEF EFFECTS ARE NOT ABOUT LYING TO YOURSELF IN THESE CASES IN THESE EXPERIMENTS AS YOU'LL NOTICE THE SUBJECTS DIDN'T HAVE PRIOR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT GREELIN OR ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF THEIR DAILY ROUTINE ON WEIGHT LOSS IN BLOOD PRESSURE SO IN ORDER FOR THEM TO WORK YOU HAVE TO BE NAIVE TO THE INFORMATION RIGHT YOU CAN'T SIMPLY LIED YOURSELF AND TELL YOURSELF WHAT YOU WANT TO BELIEVE AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BUT ALSO IMPORTANT IS THAT THE MIND AND THE BODY ARE IN THIS FASCINATING INTERPLAYN TO DAY WE'VE TALKED MAINLY ABOUT HOW THE BODY IN AND THINGS THAT WE PUT INSIDE THIS TOOB THIS A THAT RUNS FROM OUR MOUTH TO TO THE OTHER END TO ERECT THEM BASICALLY IS IMPACTING ALL THESE SELS THESE NURONS MYCROBIODA IN THERE A MUCOSAL LINING HEART LUNGS AND HOW ALL THAT INFORMATION IS FEEDING UP TO THE BRAIN TO IMPACT HOW WE FEEL UP HERE BUT ALSO HOW WE FEEL UP HERE IS IMPACTING HOW OUR BODY REACTS AT LEVELS OF VERY COR PHYSIOLOGY THAT YOU COULDN'T JUST TELL YOURSELF THAT THIS WAS GOIN TO WORK BUT WHAT YOU BELIEVE ABOUT CERTAIN SUBSTANCES CERTAIN FOODS CERTAIN NEUTRANCE DOES HAVE A PROFOUND EFFECT ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THEIR IMPACT AND SOMETIMES YOU IN THE QUOLITY IN DIRECTION OF THAT IMPACT WELL FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR THEIR SUPPORT OF THIS PODCAST THE RESPONSE THAT WE'VE RECEIVED SINCE RELEASING

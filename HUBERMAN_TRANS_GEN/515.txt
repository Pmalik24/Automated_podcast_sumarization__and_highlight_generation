WELCOME TO THE HUBERMEN LAPOTCANS  A SCIENCE SCIENCE SPASE TO I MANDER HUBERMEN AND I'M A PROFESSOR OF NERBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SCIENCE BASED PROTOCOLS FOR SLEEP MOOD LEARNING NUTRITION EXERCISE OF VARIOUS KINDS STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE AND HYPERTROPHY AND WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOME PROTOCALS THAT RELATE TO CREATIVITY WE GON TO TALK ABOUT BEHAVIORAL PROTOCOLS SUPPLEMENT BASE PROTOCALS ALL SCIENCE BACK BY QUALITY PURE REVIEW LITERATURE THE REASON THAT WERE HOLDING THIS EPISODE NOW IS THAT IN THE RECENT PREVIOUS EPISODES WE'VE COVERED SOME PRETTY INTENSE AND INDEPT TOPICS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT VISION AND HOW WE SEE AND HOW TO GET BETTER AT SEEING AND HOW TO MAINTAIN VISION WE TALKED ABOUT HERING IN BALANCE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT CHEMICAL SENSING AND WE HAD A GUEST EPISODE THAT COVERED A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT NEW AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN NEROL SCIENCE AS WELL AS MENTAL HEALTH THAT WAS THE INTERVIEW EPISODE WITH DOLCTOR CARL DISEROF SO GIVEN THAT WE'VE COVERED SO MUCH DETAILED INFORMATION IN THE PREVIOUS TWENTY SEVEN EPISODES OF THE HUBERMAN LABPODCAST I DECIDED THAT WE WOULD HOLD OFFICE HOURS OFFICE HOURS IN THE UNIVERSITY SETTING ARE WHEN STUDENTS COME TO THE PROFESSOR'S OFFIS WERE YOU MEET OUTDOORS ON CAMPUS OR IN THE CLASSERUM TO REVIEW THE MATERIAL AND QUESTIONS FROM LECTURE IN MORE DETAIL NOW UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET FACE TO FACE IN REAL LIFE BUT NONE THE LESS YOU'VE BEEN SENDING YOUR QUESTIONS PUTTING THEM IN THE COMMENT SECTION ON YOUTOBE ET CETERA AND I'VE PREPARED A NUMBER OF ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE SHOWN UP MOST FREQUENTLY NOW IN ORDER TO PROVIDE CONTEXT AND STRUCTURE TO THE WAY THAT WE WILL ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS I'VE ARRANGE THE SCIENCE AND SCIENCE BASE PROTOCALS THAT RELATE TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF LIFE SUCH AS MOOD EXERCISE SLEEP WAKING ANXIETY CREATIVITY ET CETERA INTO THE CONTEXT OF A DAY SELECTING THE UNIT OF A DAY IN ORDER TO DELIVER THIS SCIENCE INFORMATION AND PROTOCALS IS NOT A HAPHAZARD DECISION ON MY PART IT'S ACTUALLY THE CASE THAT EVERY CELL IN OUR BODY EVERY ORGAN IN OUR BODY AND OUR BRAIN IS MODULATED OR CHANGES ACROSS THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR DAY IN A VERY REGULAR AND PREDICTABLE RHYTHM AND IT'S NO COINCIDENCE THAT THE EARTH SPINS ONCE ON ITS ACIS EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS THESE TWO THINGS ARE CORDINATED BY VIRTUE OF GENES AND DIFFERENT PROTINES AND THINGS THAT ARE EXPRESSED IN EVERY CELL OF YOUR BODY AND SO SELECTING THE UNIT OF THE DAY IS NOT JUST A PRACTICAL ONE BUT IT'S ONE THAT'S RELATED TO OUR DEEPER BIOLOGY YOU MAY HAVE HEARD IN MY INTERVIEW EPISODE WITH DOCTOR CALLED ISEROPH THAT HE HIMSELF IN ORDER TO JUGGLE A TREMENDOUS WORK LOAD A FULTIME CLINICAL PRACTICE A LAB OF FORTY PLUS PEEP A FAMILY OF FIVE CHILDREN ET CETERA BREAKS UP HIS LIFE INTO UNITS OF DAYS AND SO TO DAY WE ARE GOING TO FURTHER DISECT THE DAY AS A UNIT THAT ONE CAN MANAGE AND MANAGE EXTREMELY WELL AND IN FACT CAN OPTIMIZE SO WE'RE BASICALLY GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO LEVERAGE SCIENCE PASED PROTOCOLS AND WHEN I SAY SCIENCE I MEAN QUALITY PURE REVIEWED SCIENCE PUBLISHED IN EXCELLENT JOURNALS REUN TO TALK ABOUT IT TAKE THAT SCIENCE CONVERT IT INTO SPECIFIC PROTOCOLS THAT BREAK UP ALONG THE COURSE OF A SINGLE DAY AND DIRECT CERTAIN TYPES OF BEHAVIORS IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE THE VARIOUS FEATURES OF LIFE I WILL COUCH THIS IN THE CONTECT OF WHAT I DO ACROSS A DAILY TWENTY FOR OUR RHYTHM THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW THIS SCHEDULE AT ALL OR EVEN IN PART IT'S JUST BY WAY OF EXAMPLE ANY NUMBER OF THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT I DESCRIBE COULD BE APPLY TO ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SCHEDULS OR FRAMEWORKS BUT IF THERE'S ONE TRUTH THAT APPLIES ALL OF US IS THAT WE ALL HAVE TO EXIST WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THIS TWENTY FOR OUR RHYTHM THAT WE ALL POSSESS SO THAT'S WHAT WE'LL FOCASS ON BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROR MY TEACHING IN RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COS TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS ATH LETIC GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOM DELIHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THE REASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS AN THEREASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIGREENS ONCE OR TWICE TO DAY IS THAT HELPS ME COVER ALL OF MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGHT HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH ARE VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GUP MICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WITH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSENTALY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITHOUT LETIC GREENS IT GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED AND THE PROBICS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIOM IF YOU LIKE TO TRIATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETI GREEN STOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIE FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THREE K TOO THERE ARE TON OF DAT AND OW SHOWING THAT VITEMEND THREE IS ESSENSIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH EVEN IF WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICIENT INVITEM IN D THREE AND K TOO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CARVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATHLETIC GREENSTOCKOM SLASH HUBERMN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FIFREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMIN D THREE K TO TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENTS IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND PATASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR I'VE TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLE OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLITES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES IN ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIA MANESIUM IN POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOES ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEM CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLYTES ARE NOT PRESENT AND EHYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE AURE MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOU'RE GETTING THE PROPARATIOES OF ELECTROLITES IF YOU' LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEEMENT DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMENT AND YOU'L GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THEY'RE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT TA TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENT  DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMAN SO LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW TO APPLY QUALITY PURE REVIEWED SCIENCE TO YOUR DAY AND HOW TO OPTIMIZE EVERYTHING FROM SLEEP TO LEARNING CREATIVITY MEAL TIMING ET CETERA AS I MENTION EARLIER I'M GOING TO DO THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF MY DAY AND WHAT I TYPICALLY DO HOWEVER THE SPECIFIC PROTOCALLS FOR ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS SLEEP RELAXATION MEAL TIMING EXERCISE ET CETERA ANY ONE OR ALL OF THOSE COULD BE REARRANGED TO SUIT YOUR SPECIFIC NEEDS I AM GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT I DO FROM MORNING UNTIL WAKING AND EVEN WHAT I DO WHILE I SLEEP IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE MY SLEEP SO LET'S START WITH GETTING UP IN THE MORNING NOW FOR ME I TEND TO WAKE UP SOMETIME AROUND SIX A M SIX THIRTY SOMETIMES AS LATE AS SEVEN A M I DON'T TYPICALLY SLEEP MUCH SLATER THAN SEVEN A M THE FIRST STHING I DO AFTER I WAKE UP AS I TAKE THE PEND THAT'S ON MY NIGHT STAND AND THE PAT OF PAPER ON MY NIGHT STAND AND I WRITE DOWN THE TIME IN WHICH I WOKE UP NOW I DO SLEEP WITH MY PHONE IN MY ROOM I REALIZE THIS IS CONSIDERED A SIN AND HAS CERTAIN HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH IT BUT I PUT MY PHONE ON AIRPLANE MODE ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP AND THEN I SET MY ALARM TYPICALY FOR SIX THIRTY A M AND SOME DAYS THE ALARM WAKES ME UP OTHER DAYS I WAKE UP BEFORE THE ALARM AND YES SOME DAYS THE ALARM GOES OFF AND I HIT SNEWS A FEW TIMES AND THEN USUALLY BY SEVEN A M I AM UP AND OUT OF BED THE REASON FOR WRITING DOWN WHAT TIME I WAKE UP IS BECAUSE I WANT TO KNOW THAT AVERAGE WAKE UP TIME THAT AVERAGE WAKE UP TIME IN FORMS WHAT'S CALLED MY TEMPERATURE MINIMUM IT TELLS ME WHEN MY BODY TEMPERATURE WAS LOWEST THE TEMPERATURE MINIMUM IS THE TIME IN EACH TWENTY FOUR HOURS CYCLE THAT YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE IS LOWEST I DON'T SLEEP WITH THE THERMOMETER IN MY MOUTH OR ELSEWHERE AND I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD EITHER INSTEAD I KNOW THAT THE LOWEST TEMPERATURE THAT MY BODY WILL BE AT ACROSS THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR CYCLE TENDS TO BE TWO HOURS BEFORE MY TYPICAL WAKE UP TIME AND I WANT TO KNOW THAT NUMBER ITS CALLED OUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM SO FOUR SOMEBODY THAT TYPICALLY WAKES UP AT AIGHT A M THEN YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM IS SOME TIME AROUND SIX A M REMEMBER THE TEMPERATURE MINIMUM IS A TIME IN THE TWENTY FOR OUR CYCLE I DON'T CARE WHAT MY ACTUAL TEMPERATURE IS I CARE WHEN MY LOWEST TEMPERATURE IS AND I KNOW THAT THAT LOWEST TEMPERATURE IS APPROXIMATELY TWO HOURS BEFORE MY AVERAGE WAKE UP TIME SO I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU WRITE DOWN WHEN YOU WAKE UP OR TRACK THAT IN SOME WAY THAT WORKS FOR YOU AND USE THAT AS A REFERENCE POINT TO DETERMINE YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM WE WILL RETURN TO THE TEMPERATURE MINIMUM AND HOW YOU CAN LEVERAGE THE TEMPERATURE MINIMUM FOR SEVERAL THINGS SHIFTING YOUR CLOCK SHIFTING YOUR CIRCADIAN SLEEP SCHADUL AND WAKE SCHADUAL ALSO FOR SHIFTING YOUR EATING SCHEDUAL ET CETERA WE WILL RETURN TO THAT BUT EVEN IF YOU DON'T TRAVEL EVEN IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THINGS LIKE JETLAG EVEN IF YOU SLEEP FABULOUSLY ALL YOUR ROUND NEVER HAVE A POOR NIGHT SLEEP KNOWING YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM THAT TIME WHEN YOUR TEMPERATURE IS AT ITS LOWEST POINT IS A VALUABLE THING TO KNOW THE SECOND THING I DO AFTER I WAKE UP IS TO GET INTO FORWARD AMBULATION WHICH IS JUST NERD SPEAK FOR TAKING A WALK I HAVE A DOG AND AS MANY OF YOU KNOW HE'S A BULL DOG AND HE DOESN'T REALLY LIKE TO WALK ESPECIALLY NOT IN THE MORNING BUT FOR HUMANS AND FOR ANIMALS THERE'S A PHENOMENON WHEREBY WHEN WE GENERATE OUR OWN FORWARD MOTION FORWARD AMBULATION VISUAL IMAGES PASS BY US ON OUR EYES SO CALLED OPTIC FLOW AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE LOW VISION ARE NO VISION THE SAME PHENOMENON OCCURS IN THE AUDITORY SYSTEM SOUNDS PASS BY US IN SO CALLED AUDITORY FLOW GETTING INTO A MODE OF FORWARD AMBULATION AND ESPECIALLY EXPERIENCING VISUAL FLOW HAS A POWERFUL EFFECT ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THE EFFECT IT HAS IS ESSENTIALLY TO QUIET OR REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF NURAL ACTIVITY IN THIS BRAIN STRUCTURE CALLED THE IMMIGDULA A MIGDULA MEANS ALMOND AND MANY OF YOU HAVE PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT THE AMIGDULA FOR IT'S ROLL IN ANXIETY AND FEAR AND THREAT DETECTION AND INDEED THE IMIDULA IS PART OF THE NETWORK IN THE BRAIN THAT GENERATES FEELINGS OF FEAR AND THREAT AND ANXIETY DOES A BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS TO BUT THAT'S ONE OF ITS PRIMARY FUNCTIONS THERE ARE NOW AT LEAST HALF A DOZEN QUALITY PAPERS PUBLISHED INQUALITY PURE REVIEW JOURNULS THAT SHOW THAT FORWARD AMBULATION WALKING OR BIKING OR RUNNING AND GENERATING OPTIC FLOW IN PARTICULAR HAS THIS INCREDIBLE PROPERTY OF LOWERING ACTIVITY IN THE EMIGDULA AND THEREBY REDUCING LEVELS OF ANXIETY THERE TWO PAPERS THAT I LIKE TO HIGHLIKE IN PARTICULAR THAT RELATE TO THIS PHENOMENON THE FIRST ONE WAS PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL NURON AND THE TITLE OF THIS PAPER IS WHOLE BRAIN FUNCTIONAL ULTR SOUND IMAGING THAT JUST MEANS THEYAVE A COOL TECHNIQUE TO VALUATE THE ACTIVITY OF STRUCTURES IN THE BRAIN A CROSS THE ENTIREBRAIN REVEALS BRAIN MODULES FOR VISUAL MOTOR INTEGRATION WHAT THEY FOUND IN THIS STUDY AND I SHOULD MENTION THE FIRST AUTHORS MOST SAY THIS COMES FROM BOTON ROSKA'S GROUP THIS WAS WORK DONE IN MICE BUT I WILL TALK ABOUT OTHER SPECIES IN A MOMENT WHAT THEY FOUND WAS ESSENTIALLY THAT WHEN THESE MICE WALK FORWARD AND THEIR EYES MOVED FROM SIDE TO SIDE WHICH IS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF MOVING FORWARD SO CALLE OPTIC FLOW IS FLOWING PAST THEIR EYES MANY BRAIN AREAS ARE ACTIVATED INCREASE IN THEIR LEVEL OF FIRING BUT THE EMIGDALAND PARTICULAR REDUCED ITS LEVELS OPFIRING THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING FINDING BUT IT IS IN MICE HOWEVER ANOTHER PAPER I MOVEMENT INTERVENTION ENHANCE IS EXTINCTION BY A MIGDULADEACTIVATION WAS PUBLISH IN THE THE JOURNAL OF NEURO SCIENCE A STRONG JOURNAL AND SHOWS THAT AGAIN THESE I MOVEMENTS THESE LATERAL EYE MOVEMENTS FROM SIDE TO SIDE REDUCE IT ACTIVITY LEVELS IN THIS FEAR SLASH THREAT SLASH ANXIETY CENTER IN THE BRAIN THE EMIGDULA NOW THOSE ARE I MOVEMENTS THEY DIDN'T SPECIFICALLY LOOK AT FORWARD AMBULATION AND YET OTHER PAPERS HAVE LOOKED AT FORWARD AMBULATION AND WE KNOW THAT FORWARD AMBULATION WALKING FORWARD GENERATES THE SORTS OF I MOVEMENTS THAT CAUSE OPTIC FLOW AND REDUCTIONS IN A MIGAL ACTIVATION SO FOR ME THIS PROCESS OF TAKING A WALK EACH MORNING ISN'T ABOUT EXERCISE IT'S NOT ABOUT BURNING CALORIES IT'S NOT ABOUT ANY OF THAT IT'S REALLY ABOUT GETTING INTO OPTIC FLOW AND REDUCING THE LEVELS OF AMIGDAL ACTIVATION NOW I DON'T HAVE ANXIETY AT LEAST I DON'T HAVE CHRONIC ANXIETY OR GENERALIZED ANXIETY I TEND HAVE A LOT OF ENERGY BUT AT THESE POINTS IN THE MORNING I'M NOT VERY ENERGETIC SOMETIMES I 'M ORT OF SHUFFLING MORE THAN I'M WALKING IN FACT IN COSTELLIS ALMOST ALWAYS SHUFFLING IN I'M ALMOST ALWAYS TRY TO DRAG HIM FIRST THING IN THE MORNING BUT THAT WALK IS AF PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT PROTOCALL EACH DAY BECAUSE IT REALLY SERVES TO PUSH MY NEROLOGY IN THE DIRECTION THAT I LIKE IT TO GO WHICH IS ALERT BUT NOT ANXIOUS AND IS KIND OF A FINE LINE SOMETIMES ESPECIALLY AS EVENTS SURFACE THROUGHOUT THE DAY EMALS COME IN TEXMUCS COME IN GET BOMBARDED WITH THE NUMBER OF THINGS I WANT TO BE ALERT AND RESPONSIVE I WANT TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS BUT I DON'T WANT TO FEEL ANXIOUS OR I'M REACTIVE TO THESE THINGS SO THE FORWARD AMBULATION AND THIS OPTIC FLOW IS THE WAY THAT I INSURE BASED ON QUALITY PURERE IEU DATA THAT MY IMIGDAL ACTIVATION IS SLIGHTLY SUPPRESSED NOW AT THE SAME TIME I ALSO WANT THE ALERTNESS I WANT ALERT AN FOCUST I DON'T JUST WANT TO BE SLEEPY OR SUPERSUPERRELAXED I WANT TO HAVE A HIGH DEGREE OF FOCUS AND ALERTNESS BECAUSE I'M SOON GOING TO MOE INTO ABOUT OF WORK I NEED TO LEAN INTO THE DAY SO IN ORDER TO DO THAT I MAKE SURE THAT THE WALKING IS DONE OUTDOORS THAT MIGHT BE SORT OF A DOE BUT MANY PEOPLE GET UP AND START MOVING AROUND THEIR HOUSE THEIR APARTMENT AND THEY DON'T GO ANYWHERE AND JUST WALKING AROUND INSIDE IT WILL GENERATE SOME OPTIC FLOW BUT NOTHING LIKE THE SORT OF OBTIC FLOW THAT YOU CAN GENERATE IN LARGER ENVIRONMENTS LIKE OUT OF DOORS ENVIRONMENTS IF YOU CAN'T GET OUT DOORS DOING IT INDOORS IS PERFECTLY FINE BUT IT'S NOT CN TO HAVE THE SAME MAGNITUDE OF POSITIVE EFFECT NOW AN ORDER TO GET THE ALERTNESS I DO IT OUT DOORS BECAUSE I ALSO WANT SUNLIGHT IN MY EYES I KNOW MANY OF YOU HAVE HEARD ME TALK ABOUT THIS AT NAUSEUM ON VARIOUS PODCASTS AND THIS PODCAST BUT GETTING SUNLIGHT IN YOUR EYES FIRST THING IN THE MORNING IS ABSOLUTELY VITAL TO MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH IT IS PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT ANY IN ALL OF US CANNON SHOULD DO IN ORDER TO PROMOTE METABOLIC WELL BEING PROMOTE THE POSITIVE FUNCTION OF YOUR HORMON SYSTEM GET YOUR MENTAL HEALTH STEERING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THER NUMBER OF REASONS FOR THIS BUT BEFORE I GET INTO THOSE REASONS LET ME JUST EMPHASIZE WHAT THE PROTOCALL IS THE PROTOCALL IS GET OUT DOORS I DEALLY WITH NO SUNGLASSES IF YOU CAN DO THAT SAFELY EVEN IF THERE'S CLOUD COVER MORE PHOTONS LIGHT INFORMATION ARE COMING THROUGH THAT CLOUD COVER THAN WOULD BE COMING FROM A VERY BRIGHT INDOOR BALL SO GETTING OUT DOORS IS ABSOLUTELY HOW LONG SHOULD YOU DO THIS IT'S GOING TO DEPEND ON THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE ENVIRONMENT IT'S GOING TODEPEND ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FACTORS TWO MINUTES WOULD BE A MINIMUM TEN MINUTES WOULD BE EVEN BETTER AND IF YOU CAN THIRTY MINUTES WOULD BE FANTASTIC NOW IT'S A VERY BRIGHT DAY OR YOU KNOW YOU LIVE IN A PLACE WERE THERE'S BRIGHT SUNLIGHT CLEAR DAY ON A SNOWFIELD YOU WOULD ONLY NEED SOMETHING LIKE SIXTY SECONDS BUT MOST PEOPLE AREN'T LIVING IN NO SORTS OF CONDITIONS SO GETTING OUTSIDE FOR A TEN MINUTE WALK OR A FIFTEEN MINUTE WALK WILL BASICALLY IN SURE THAT YOU'RE GETTING ADEQUATE STIMULATION OF THESE NURONS IN THE EYE THAT ARE CALLED THE MELONOPSEN INTRINSICALLY PHOTOSENSITIVE GANGLINSELLS A NO THAT'S A MOUTHFUL THESE ARE NURONS THAT DON'T CARE ABOUT SHAPES OF OBJECTS OR THE MOTION OF OBJECTS THESE ARE NURONS THAT CONVEY TO THE BRAIN THAT IT'S DAYTIME AND IT'S TIME TO BE ALERT AND IT SETS IN MOTION A HUGE NUMBER OF BIOLOGICAL CASCADES WITHIN EVERY CELL AN ORGAN OF YOUR BODY FROM YOUR LIVER TO YOUR GOT TO YOUR HEART TO YOUR BRAIN REALLY SETS THINGS DOWN THE RIGHT PATH EARLY IN THE DAY WE EXPERIENCE A NATURAL AND HEALTHY BUMP IN A HORMON CALLED QARTISALL CORTUS ALL COMES FROM THE A MIGDOLA THAT CORTIS ALL AS I MENTION IS HEALTHY IN NORMAL AND PROMOTES WAKEFULNESS IT ACTUALLY PROMOTES A HEALTHY IMMUNE SYSTEM SO I KNOW YOU'VE HEARD THAT STRESS AND CORTISALL DESTRUP THE IMMUNE SYSTEM BUT NOT THE SHORT LITTLE PULSE OF CORTIS ALL THAT YOU GET EACH MORNING IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THAT PULSE OF CORTISALL ARRIVE EARLY IN THE DAY I ON'E EMPHASIZE THIS AGAIN IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THAT PULSE OF CORTIS ALL ARRIVE EARLY IN THE DAY AND THAT PULSE OF CORTIS ALL IS GOING TO HAPPEN ONCE EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS NO MATTER WHAT IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND YOU GET TO TIME IT HOW DO YOU TIMEIT PRIMARILY BY WHEN YOU VIEW BRIGHT SUN LIGHT OR BRIGHT LIGHT OF ANOTHER KIND AND WILL TALK ABOUT THAT IN A MOMENT SO YOU WANT THAT QUARTERS ALL PUSHED EARLY IF YOU WAKE UP BEFORE THE SUN COMES OUT IT'S FINE TO TURN ON ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS BUT THEN YOU WOULD WANT TO GET OUTSIDE AS SOON AS YOU CAN TO GET THIS ARTTHIS EXCUSE ME NATURAL LIGHT STIMULATION OF YOUR EYES AND IT DOES HAVE TO BE TO YOUR EYES JUST TO REALLY DRILL DOWN INTO THE DETAILS FOR A MOMENT YOU DON'T WANT TO STARE DIRECTLY AT THE SUN OR ANY LIGHT THAT SO BRIGHT THAT IT FEELS PAINFUL IF IT'S IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO CLOSE YOUR EYES OR BLINK PLEASE DO YOU DN'T WANT A DAMAGE DIRETINAS THE POINT HERE IS TO GET THE SUNLIGHT INDIRECTLY IT'S GOING TO ESSENTIALLY BE SCATTERED EVERYWHERE THROUGH THE CLOUD COVER BUT YOU KNOW FROM LOOKING AT AS AT A FLASH LIGHT DIRECTLY INTO THAT FLASHLIGHT VERSES LOOKING AT THE BEAM THAT FLASHLIGHT GENERATES ON THE GROUND THAT IF YOU'RE STANDING IN THE SHADE YOU'RE GOING TO GET LESS OF THAT SUNLIGHT THAN YOU ARE IF YOU'RE OUT IN AN OPEN FIELD SO THIS IS WHY THE TIME OUTSIDE IT'S GOING TO NEED TO VERY DEPENDING ON YOUR PARTICULAR ENVIRONMENT BUT DO YOUR BEST TO DO THIS EVERY DAY IF YOU MISS A DAY NOBIG DEAL BUT TRY NOT TO MISS MORE THAN ONE DAY OTHERWISE YOUR MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH WELL START TO SUFFER AND DOING THIS EACH DAY COSTS NOTHING IT'S JUST TIME YOU CAN COMBINE IT WITH THE FORWARD AMBULATION WITH THE WALK AND THE OPTIC FLOW THAT I TALKED ABOUT BEFORE AND THAT'S WHAT I DO EACH MORNING TO GENERATE A SENSE OF ALERTNESS IN MY BODY AND BRAIN TO GENERATE A SENSE OF CALM YET ALERT AND THAT'S ALSO WHAT I DO WITH COSTELLA WITH MY BULLDOG PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME DO THE SAME MECHANISMS APPLI TO ANIMALS WELL THE REALITY IS MANY OF THESE MECHANISMS WERE ACTUALLY DISCOVERED IN ANIMALS AND THEN WE'RE TESTED IN HUMANS AND VERIFIED THAT THEY ALSO EXIST IN HUMANS NOT ALWAYS SOMETIMES IT WAS THE REVERSE WHERE THEY WERE TESTED FIRST IN HUMANS AND THEN BROUGHT TO ANIMALS BUT INDEED YOUR DOG YOUR HORSE I YOU NOW I DON'T N WHAT OTHER ANIMALS ARE OUT THERE THEY NEED THIS NOW IF YOU HAVE A HAMPSTER OR NOCTURNAL ANIMAL THE REASON WHY THEY LIKE TO RUN ON THEIR WHEELS AT NIGHT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOTURNAL THEY DON'T LIKE BEING IN THE LIGHT LIGHT ACTUALLY CAUSES THEM TO FREEZE IGHT ACTUALLY THAT YOU ARE INTO A QUARIA OU LIKE FISH THOW I SAY DON'T OVERFEED YOUR FISH YOU'LL KILL THE FISH THAT'S TRUE BUT GUESS WHAT THE FASTEST WAY TO KILL HE FISHES TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY THEY ALSO NEED CIRCADEAN SAY CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS THESE TWENTY FOUR HOUR RHYTHMS SO WE'LL DO AN ENTIRE MONTH AT SOME POINT ABOUT PET HEALTH BUT MEANWHILE GET THAT MORNING SUNLIGHT SO WE NOW WE HAVE A FIRST PROTO CALL WHICH IS TO WRITE DOWN THE TIME OF DAY THAT YOU WAKE UP THE SECOND PROTOCALL IS TO GET TAKE A WALK FIRST THING IN THE MORNING AND THE THIRD PROTOCALL IS WOVEN IN WITH THAT WALK AT LEAST FOR ME WHICH IS TO GET THAT SUNLIGHT EXPOSURE NOW IF YOU CAN'T GET SUNLIGHT EXPOSURE YOU ABSOLUTELY CAN'T I DON'T NECESSARILY RECOMMEND BUYING ONE OF THESE DAWN ALARM LIGHTS THEY THEY AND I'M SORRY TO SAY THIS BUT THEY'RE JUST VASTLY OVER PRICE RELATIVE TO WHAT THEY ARE THEY'RE BES ELY UPRIGHT ELY D I INSTEAD USE I HAVE A PAD THAT'S A NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY LUCKS LIGHT PAD I THINK IT IS DESIGN FOR DRAWING THOSE ARE AVAILABLE AT A FRACTION OF THE COST THAT A THAT A MORNING LIGHT A SIMULATOR WELL WOULD PROVIDE AND YET IT'S REALLY A BRIGHT ENOUGH AT LEAST FOR ME I TEND TO PUT IT ON MY DESK WHILE I WORK EACH MORNING SO HERE'S A PRINCIPLE THAT YOU CAN LEVERAGE IF YOU WANT TO BE ALERT VIEW BRIGHT LIGHTS AND MAKE THOSE LIGHTS ABOVE YOU THEY TEND OR IN FRONT OF YOU IF YOU WANT TO GO TO SLEEP SOONER YOU DON'T WANT TO BE AWAKE FOR WHATEVER REASON TRYING TO LIMINATE YOUR EXPOSURE TO LIGHT AND THIS AGAIN IS NOT ABOUT EXPOSURE OF THE SKIN TO LIGHT THIS IS ABOUT EXPOSURE OF YOUR EYES OF YOUR NURL RETINAS TO LIGHT FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT BLUE LIGHT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT BLUE LIGHT IS PRECISELY THE WAVELENGTH OF LIGHT THAT IS OPTIMAL FOR STIMULATING THESE NURONS IN YOUR EYE WHICH SET YOUR CIRCATEIAN RHYTHMS PROPERLY SO YOU DON'T WANT TO SHIELD YOURSELF FROM BLUE LIGHT EARLY IN THE DAY OR THROUGHOUT THE DAY OR ANY TIME YOU WANT TO BE AWAKE IFACT THAT COULD HAVE A NUMBER OF DETRIMENTAL CONSEQUENCES FORTUNATELY ALL THOSE CONSEQUENCES ARE GOING TO BE REVERSIBLE AFTER A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME OF MAKING SHORE YOU DON'T WEAR YOUR BLUE BLOCKERS DURING THE DAY PLEASE THE TIME TO WEAR BLU BLOCKERS IF YOU DO IS AT NIGHT AND IN THE EVENING WHEN YOU'RE HEADED TOWARDS SLEEP MY COLLEAGUE SAMMER HATAR WHO IS HEAD OF THE CHRONOBILGO UNIT AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES A MENTAL HEALTH HAS SPOKEN ABOUT THIS BEFORE ON MY INSTERGRAM WE HELD IN ITST GRANDLIVE AND I SAID SAMMER WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT BLUE BLOCKERS AND HE SAID I DON'T THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA AT ALL UNLESS IT'S REALLY LATE AT NIGHT AND YOU'RE IN A BRIGHT ENVIRONMENT NYOURE TRYING TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF BRIGHT LIGHT THAT THAT IMPACKS THE EYES ELIMINATING SPECIFIC WAVELENGTHS OF LIGHT IN SAMMER'S OPINION AND ALSO IN MY OPINION IS NOT A NATURAL THING FOR THE VISUAL SYSTEM IN THE BRAIN TO EXPERIENCE SOME PEOPLE GET HEADACHES WHILE THEY WORK ON THE COMPUTER ALL DEY OR STARING AT SCREENS AND SO THEY GET BLUEBLOCKERS THINKING THAT'S GOING TO PROTECT THEM FROM THEIR HEADACHES HOWEVER ANY PROTECTION THAT YOU GET FROM HEADACHES FROM BLUE BLOCKERS IS GOING TO BE MINIMAL IN COMPARISON TO WHAT REALLY GOING ON THERE WHICH IS THAT PEOPLE ARE VIEWING DEVICES AND SCREENS UP CLOSE FOR TOO MANY HOURS THROUGHOUT THE TWENTY FOR HOUR CYCLE A BETTER REMEDY WOULD BE TO STEP AWAY FROM THAT COMPUTER FROM TIME TO TIME AND TO MAKE SURE THT YOU CAN LOOK FAR OFF INTO THE DISTANCE IDEALLY A DISTANCE LONGER THAN TWENTY FEET LIKE YOUR HARIYES AND GO OUT ON BALCONY THINGS OF THAT SORT TAKE A WALK AROUND GET INTO OPTIC FLOW SO IF YOUR INTO BLUE BLOCKERS MAKE SURE YOU'RE ONLY WEARING THEM IN THE LATE EVENING AND AT NIGHT I PERSONALLY DON'T WEAR BLUE BLOCKERS AT ALL I PREFER TO JUST CONTROL MY LIGHT VIEWING BEHAVIOR BY DOING THIS UME I DO THE OTHER FORM OF CIRCATIN CONTROL WHICH IS TUTE DIM THE LIGHTS AND I DO THAT BECAUSE DIMMING THE LIGHTS AND SETTING THEM LOWER IN THE ENVIRONMENT SETS UP THE BRAIN AND BODY FOR SLEEP MUCH BETTER THAN SIMPLY JUST WEARING SOME BLUE LIGHT BLUE BLOCKERS SCUSE ME AND PLEASE KNOW IF YOU DO WEAR BLUE BLOCKERS THAT IF THE LIGHT IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT IS BRIGHT ENOUGH IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE BLOCKING OUT THE BLUES THESE SELLS IN THE EYE WILL RESPOND TO OTHER WAVELINGTS OF LIGHT SO IAVE NO VANDETTA AGAINST THE BLUE BLOCKERS AND YOU KNOW I FULLY EXPECT THE BLUE BLOCKANISE DOES TO COME AFTER ME WITH I GUESS BLUE BLOCKERS BUT AS YOU DO THAT PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT THE BIOLOGY POINTS IN THE DIRECTION OF GET A LOT OF BRIGHT LIGHT THROUGHOUT THE DAY INCLUDING BLUE LIGHT AND AT NIGHT JUST LIMIT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF OVER ALL LIGHT THAT YOU'RE EXPOSED TO INCLUDING FROM SCREENS SO THEN COSTELLO AND I GET BACK FROM OUR WALK SOMETIMES THAT WALK WAS TEN MINUTES SOMETIMES IT WAS SIXTY MINUTES DEPENDING ON HOW SLOWLY COSTELLO IS WALKING THAT DAY INDEED MANY MORNINGS I'M THE GUY CARRYING HIS BULLDOG BACK UP THE HILL MY NEIGHBORS KNOW ME SO WELL THEY KNOW COSTELLA SO WELL THAT THEY'VE SINCE STOPPED PULLING OVER AND ASKING IF THE DOG IS OQUE SOMETIMES THEY'LL ASK IF I' MOQE NONE THE LESS WE GET BACK I GIVE HIM HIS FOOD I GIVE HIM IS WATER AND I GIVE ME MY WATER I'M A BIG BELIEVER BASED ON QUALITY PURE REVIEW DATA THAT HIDRATION IS ESSENTIAL FOR MENTAL PERFORMANCE NOW I CONFESS I DON'T REALLY LIKHT DRINKING BIG GLASSES ARE BIG JUGS A WATER FIRST THING IN THE MORNING I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT MY THIRST DOES INTEND TO KICK IN FIRST THING YOU MAY BE DIFFERENT EITHER WAY I FORCE MYSELF ESSENTIALLY TO DRINK AT LEAST SIXTEEN AND MOST DAYS THIRTY TWO OUNCE IS A WATER I ALSO PUT A LITTLE BIT OF SEA SALT IN THE WATER AS MANY OF YOU KNOW NURONS REQUIRE IONIC FLOW WHAT THAT MEANS AS NURONS NEED SODIUM THEY NEED MAGNESIUM AND THEY NEED ATASKIUM IN ORDER TO FUNCTION WE DO TEND TO GET DEHYDRATED AT NIGHT EVEN IF THE DAY IS NOT VERY HOT I TRY IN TOP OFF OR I TRYING MAKE SURE THAT I'M HYDRATED EARLY IN THE DAY BEFORE I BEGIN ANY WORK SO I MAKE MYSELF DRINK THIS WATER WITH A LITTLE BIT OF SEA SALT HOW MUCH SEA SALT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GET DETAIL THAT YOU I EXPOSE IT'S ABOUT HALF A TEASPOON IT'S NOT MUCH THAT'S WHAT I DO AND I DRINK THAT MORE LESS ROOM TEMPERATURE I FIND THAT DRINKING REALLY COLD WATER FIRSTHING THE DAY KONDI LIKE CRAMPS UP MY INSIDES SO I DON'T DO THAT AT THAT POINT I START THINKING ABOUT AND FANTASIZING ABOUT AND CRAVING KAFFINE BUT I DON'T DRINK THAT CAFFINE YET I PURPOSELY DELAY MY CAFFIN INTAKE TO NINETY MINUTES TO A HUNDRED ND TWENTY MINUTES AFTER I WAKE UP COURSE I KNOW WHEN I WAKE UP CAUSE I WROTE IT DOWN ALTHOUGH IT'S PRETTY EASY TO COMMIT TO MEMORY THE REASON I DELAY CAFFINE IS BECAUSE ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT INDUCES A SENSE OF SLEEPINESS IS THE BUILD UP OF A DENISINE OR AS SOME PEOPLE CALL IT ADANOCINE IN OUR SYSTEM THE BUILD UP OF A DENISINE ACCUMULATES THE LONGER WE ARE AWAKE SO WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING YOUR DENISINE LEVELS ARE LIKELY TO BE VERY LOW HOWEVER CAFFINE ISN'N A DENISNE BLOCKER I IT'S ECTUL A COMPETITIVE IN NTAGONISTS FOR YOU AF FYSIONATAS HE SORT PARKS IN THE RECEPTER THAT A DENYSINE NORMALLY WOULD PARK AT AND PREVENTS A DENISINE FROM ACTING ON THAT RECEPTOR THAT'S WHY YOU FEEL MORE ALERT BECAUSE ITS ESSENTIALLY BLOCKING THE EFFECT OF THIS SLEEPINESS FACTOR THAT WE ALL CREATE CALLED THE DENISING THE REASON FOR DELAYING KAFFINE AN TAKE NINETY MINUTES TO TWO HOURS AFTER WAKING IS I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I DON'T HAVE A LATE AFTERNOON OR EVEN EARLY AFTERNOON CRASH FROM CAFFINE ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO INSURE A KAFFINE CRASH IS TO DRINK ABOUNT CHO CAFFINE BLOCK ALL THOSE A DENISINE RECEPTORS AND THEN BY EARLYOR LATE AFTERNOON WHEN THAT KAFFINE STARTS TO WEAR OFF AND GETS DISLODGE FROM THE RECEPTORS A LOWER LEVEL OF A DENISINE IS ABLE TO CREATE A GREATER LEVEL OF SLEEPINESS IT TOOK ME YEARS TO FIGURE THIS OUT I USE TO WAKE UP AND I THINK H I DON'T WANT TO DRINK KAFFINE TOO CLOSE TO BEDTIME SOMEN T START DRINKING MY CAFFINE REALLY EARLY I LET MY CORTISAL NATURALLY COME UP IN THE MORNING I AVOID DRINKING KAFFINE UNTIL ABOUT NINETY MINUTES OR TWO HOURS AFTER WAKING AND WHEN I DO THAT I FIND THAT I DON'T EXPERIENCE THE AFTERNOON CRASH AT LEAST I DON'T EXPERIENCE THAT CRASH UNLESS I DO SOMETHING FOOLISH LIKE IN JUST FAR TOO MUCH FOOD AT LAUNCH OR I STAMPLE ALL NIGHT THE NIGHT BEFORE BUT PROVIDED I DON'T DO ANYTHING FOOLISH LIKE THAT TO LAYIN KAFFINE O NINETY MINUTES TO TWO HOURS OPTIMIZES THIS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A DENISINE AND WAKEFULNESS AND SLEEPINESS IN A WAY THAT REALLY PROVIDES A NICE CONSISTENT ARK OF ENERGY THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND BRINGS ENERGY DOWN AS I'M HEADED TOWARD SLEEP AND FALLING ASLEEP MY PRIMARY OBJECTIVE EARLY IN THE DAY IS TO GET INTO A MODE OF BEING FOCUSED BET ALERT SO THAT I CAN GET WORKD ON IVE FOUND THAT THE BEST WAY FOR ME TO ACHIEVE THAT STATE IS THROUGH FASTING SO I DON'T EAT ANYTHING UNTIL ABOUT ELEVEN AM OR TWELVE NOON I'M NOT ABSOLUTELY RELIGIOUS ABOUT IT THERE ARE DAYS WHEN I'LL HAVE A FEW BRAZIL NUTS OR A SPOONFUL OR THREE OF AMIN BUTTER FOR INSTANCE BUT MOST DAYS I'M NOT DOING THAT I'M JUST NOT EATING ANYTHING I'M DRINKING SOME KAFFINE KAFFINE SOURCE FOR ME IS YO AR BAMATE WHI YOU SETEE TASE ER MY PREFERRED SOURCES TEND TO AVOID COFFEE THESE DAYS CASIONALL HAVE A CUP BUT MOST OFTEN I STICK TO THE TEES I DRINK WATER AS MUCH AS I FEEL I I NEED TO AND WANT TO AND I ALSO DRINK MY ATHLETIC GREENS WHICH IS COMPATIBLE AT LEAST FOR ME WITH FASTING LET'S TALK ABOUT WHY FASTING WORKS TO CREATE THIS HEIGHTEN STATE OF ALERTNESS YET CALM BRAIN STATE FASTING INCREASES LEVELS OF A DRENALINE ALSO CALLED EPINEFRON IN THE BRAIN AND BODY AND WHEN OUR LEVELS OF EPINEFRAN IN A DRENDALIN ARE INCREASED WE LEARN BETTER WE CAN FOCUS BETTER THERE'S TERRIFIC DAT TO SUPPORTING THAT YOU DON'T WANT EPINEFRAN ACA A DRENALINE TOO HIGH THAT FEELS LIKE STRASS AND PANIC YOU GET GITTERY YOU CAN'T FOCUS BUT IN ITS OTIMAL RA ANGE A DRENNALIN REALLY PROVIDES A HEIGHTENED SENSE A FOCUS IN THE ABILITY TO IN CODE MEANING BRING IN AND RETAIN REMEMBER INFORMATION AND SO SINCE MY JOB IS MAINLY A CEREBRAL ONE WHEREIM WRITING GRANTS AND WORKING ON PAPERS ET CETERA I FAST IN THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY I MENTION INGESTING THINGS LIKE WHY YOUSAR YOUR BAMATE AN OR IN MY CASE ATHLETIC GREENS MANY PEOPLE ASK IN FACT THEREIS A WHOLE COMMUNITY IN DISCUSSION BOARDS ET CETERA AND YOU TWO COMMENTS ON THE INNER NET ABOUT WHAT BREAKS A FAST IN WHAT DOESN'T THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT'S GOING TO BE HIGHLY INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO DEPEND ON HOW SENSITIVE YOUR BLOOD SUGAR IS INOTH AND MORT MORE ACCURATELY IT'S GOING TO DEPEND ON THINGS LIKE YOUR INSOLENT SENSITIVITY SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOUR SOMEBODY WHO GETS UP IN THE MORNING HYDRATES AND GOES OUT FOR A SIX MILE RUN YOU COULD PROBABLY EAT A JAR OF AMON BUTTER AND STILL BE WHAT'S CALLED FAT FAST AT YOUR INSOLEN LEVELS WILL STILL BE VERY LOW BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THAT IS A LARGE VOLUME OF AMIN BUTTER EVEN TO ME AND COSTELLO THAT LARGE NUMBER OF CALLORIES COME FROM A SOURCE THAT DOESN'T INCREASE BLOOD SUGAR VERY MUCH AND INSOLENT VERY MUCH NOW 'M NOT SUGGESTING YOU DO THAT BUT WHAT I JUST DESCRIBED IS A VASTLY DIFFERENT SITUATION THAN SOMEBODY THAT ET THEIR LAST MEAL AT TWO A M AND THAT MEAL WAS ESSENTIALLY A FEAST AND FOR THAT PERSON FASTING UNTIL TEN OR ELEVEN A M THEIR BLOOD SUGAR MIGHT STILL ACTUALLY BE PRETTY HIGH OR EVEN LOW ISH SUCH THAT THEY MIGHT EAT ONE AMOND AND IT WOULD BUMP THEM OUT OF FASTING SO YOU GET THE IDEA IT'S GOING TO DEPEN ON YOUR RECENT EATING HISTORY YOUR BLOOD SUGAR HISTORY YOUR GLICAGIN STORES ET CETERA SO IF ANYONE TELLS YOU THAT BREAKS A FAST OR THAT DOESN'T THAT'S KIND OF SILLY WOULD ONE GRAIN OF SUGAR BREAK YOUR FAST NO WOULD AN ENTIRE TABLESPOON OF SUGAR BREAK YOUR FAST YES YOU'LL GET A BIG BLIPPIN BLOOD SUGAR AN INSOLENT FROM THAT HOWEVER HOW LONG THAT LAST HOW LONG IT BREAKS OR FAST WILL DEPEND ON HOW GLICAGIN TO PLEADED YOU ARE AND A NUMBER OF OTHER FACTORS SO FOR ME I JUST KEEP IT FAIRLY SIMPLE I AND JUST WATER CAFFIN FROM YOUR BAMATE AND GUY YUSA AND I DRINK MY ATHLETIC GREENS WITH SOME LEMON JUCE IN IT THAT CONSTITUTES MY FASTING AND THERE ARE DAYS WHEN I DO ALL THOSE THINGS THEIR DAYS WHEN I DO NONE OF THOSE THINGS ALTHOUGH MOST DAYS I WOULD SAY ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE DAYS OUT OF THE YEAR I'M INGESTING WATER CAFFIN AN ATHLETIC GREENS DURING THIS PERIOD OF FASTING EARLY IN THE DAY AND THAT'S THE PERIOD OF TIME WHEN I DO MY WORK ONE INTERESTING FACT ABOUT OUR BAMATE AND WHY YOUSATES IS THAT THEY INCREASE RELEASE OF SOMETHING CALLED G L P ONE GO P ONE IS RELATED TO GLUCCUGON LUCCEGON IS A HORMON THAT YOU CAN SORT OF THINK ABOUT AS OPPOSITE TO INSOLENT AND BLOOD SUGAR S MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT BUT GO P ONE HAS A COUPLE OF POSITIVE PROPERTIES ONE IS IT INCREASES LIPOLISIS AND MOBILIZATION OF BODY FAT STORES OF BURNING OF FAT IN FACT THERE ARE N OW A NUMBER OF CLINICAL TRIALS THAT ARE ACHIEVING GOOD SUCCESS AND THEREARE DRUGS OUT THERE ONLY AVELBLE BY PRESCRIPTION WHICH MIMIC GOL P ON AND OUR BEING USED TO TREAT QUITE SUCCESSFULLY CERTAIN TYPES OF DIABEDES AND OBESITY I'M NOT DIABETIC NOR AM I TRYING TO SHED A TON OF BODY FAT BUT I FIGURE AS LONG AS I'M FASTING AND AS LONG AS I LIKE YUR BAMATEING WHY YOU SO WHICH I DO I THEIR DELICIOUS I'LL TELL YOU WHICH TYPE I USE IN A MOMENT I'M MIGHT AS WELL INCREASE MY GOL PE ONE BECAUSE IT'S PROBABLY NOT AS GOOD AS GETTING OUT IN DOING SOME CARDIO WORK BUT NONE THE LESS IF I'M FASTED INCREASING GIOPE ONE IN MY SYSTEM I'MAN TO BE ALERT FROM THE CAFIN THE ADRENOLINE ET CETERA AND I'M GOING TO BE BURNING BODY FAT WHILE I'M DOING MY WORK SO FOR ME IT'S JUST IN EFFICIENT BIO CHEMICALLY RATIONAL OR I SHOULD SAY GROUNDED IN QUALITY BOU CHEMISTRY SORT OF APPROACH YEUR BAMATE COMES IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT FORMS THAT A LOT OF DIFFERENT BRANDS OUT THERE ET CETERA I DON'T HAVE ANY RELATIONSHIP WHATSOEVER IN A BUSINESS ENSE TO ANY OF THESE BRANDS SOME OF THEM ARE VERY A SMOKY I JUST BECAUSE OF SOMETHING IN MY GENETIC MAKE UP OR I DON'T KNOW MAYBE WITH OME SOME SORT OF WICROMEASOME A SOCIATED A LESION EARLY IN LIFE BUT I DON'T LIKE SMOKY FLAVORS SO I'M NOT A A GUDACEES GUY I DON'T LIKE SMOKY STUFF YOU MAIN LOVE IT BUT I TEND TO AVOID SMOKY TASTING MATES INSTEAD THERE'S A PARTICULAR BRAND THAT I JUST FOUND ON THE INTERNET CALLED ANNA PARK I DON'T KNOW ANNA I DON'T KNOW SHE HAS A PARK AND I D CERTAINLY DON'T WAT ANNA PARK IS BUT FOR ME THAT'S THE BEST TASTING YOUR BMATE AGAIN I DON'T HAVE ANY RELATIONSHIP TO THEM A BUT IT'S A FORDABLE IN THE CONTECT OF OF YOUR BMATE AND IT'S THE ONE THAT I USE AND I SHOULD MENTION A LONG LINES OF AFFORDABILITY AND GOL P ONE IS THERE'S A NICE FEATURE OF YOUR BAMATE WHICH IS IF YOU PUT IT IN A A FILTER R METAL STRAINER YOU POR A HOT WATER OVER IT AND THEN DRINK IT KEEP THE THE LEAVES THA YEUR BAMATE LEAVES CAN BE USED OVER AND OVER AGAIN IT SEEMS THAT THE GO P ONE STIMULATING ASPECTS OF MATE ACTUALLY ARE ENHANCE WITH SUBSEQUENT POR OVER SO THERE'S SOMETHING INTERESTING ABOUT THESE TEAS THAT MY A TOPHYCIANATO FRIENDS TELL ME ALLOWS THE TE TO RELEASE MORE OF SOME OF THE BENEFICIAL COMPOUNDS BY RE USING THE TEA LEAVES NOW EVENTUALLY ITO'LL GROW MOLD AND OTHER  SORTS OF DISCUSTING THINGS I'M YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TA RUTATIXPEREMENT I WOULD SE YOU CAN USE IT FOR A DAY OR TWO BEFORE IT STARTS TO GO BAD BUT THAT'S A FEATURE THAT WILL EXTEND THE LIFE OF WHATEVER A YEURBAMATE YOU HAPPEN USE IF YOU DECIDE TO USE IT AND THATS CERTAINLY WHAT I DO NEXT I WONT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT I'M DOING WHILE I'M DRINKING ALL THIS YEUR BAMATE AUSE I'M NOT JUST SITTING THERE THINKING ABOUT ALL THE GI PE ONE CIRCULATING IN MY SYSTEM I'M WORKING COUPLE OF THINGS FOR OPTIMIZING WORK SPACE THAT ARE GROUNDED IN NER SCIENCE AND PHYSIOLOGY I'VE TALKED BEFORE ABOUT THE FACT THAT WHEN OUR EYES ARE DIRECTED UPWARD LITERALLY WHEN OUR EYELIDS ARE OPEN NOW SUPRISE THERE AND WHEN OUR EYES ARE DIRECTED UPWARD IT CREATES A STATE OF HEIGHTENED ALERTN S AND THIS HAS A RELATIONSHIP TO THE BRAINSTEMNERONS THAT CREATE ALERTNESS AND THEIRE CONTROL OVER THE MUSCLES OF THE EYE AND BELIEVE OR NOT THE EYELIDS NOW IT'S NOT THE CASE THAT IF YOU ARE ABSOLUTLY EXHAUSTED AND YOU NEED TO FEEL MORE ALERT THAT LOOKING UPWARD IS GOING TO MAKE YOU FEEL WIDE AWAKE ALTHOUGH IT WILL HELP SUPPORT YOUR LEVELS OF ALERTNESS THE POINT HERE IS THAT YOU CAN OPTIMIZE YOUR WORK STATION IN A PHYSICAL WAY THAT LEVERAGIS THIS ASPECT OF THE VISUAL SYSTEM AND YOUR LEVEL OF ALERTNESS SINCE MOST OF US WANT TO BE AWAKE WHILE WERE WORKING TRY IN POSITION YOUR SCREEN OR YOUR TABLET WHATEVER DIVICE YOU HAPPEN TO BE WORKING ON AT LEAST AT EYE LEVEL AN IDEALLY SLIGHTLY HIGHER IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT DOING THIS MOST PEOPLE ARE LOOKING DOWN AT THEIR COMPUTER TABLET OR ARE ANGLING THEIR EYES AT THEIR SCREEN IN ABOUT THIRTY DEGREES THAT IS NOT GOING TO SUPPORT HEIGHTENED STATES OF ALERTNESS AND OPTIMAL ATTENTION IN FACT THE OPPOSITE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EYE POSITION AND ALERTNESS IS ALSO TRUE WHEN WE LOOK DOWN WHEN OUR EYELIDS ARE SLIGHTLY CLOSED ITTENDS TO DECREASE OUR LEVELS OF ALERTNESS AND INCREASE OUR LEVELS OF SLEEPINESS THREALLY ONE EMPHASIZE THIS THAT THERE IS A BY DIRECTIONAL OR RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE BRAIN STEMLET AREAS THAT CONTROL ALERTNESS AND THE EYES MEANING HOW ALERT YOU ARE CONTROLS HOW OPEN OR CLOSE YOUR EYES ARE NO SPRIZE THERE BUT ALSO THAT HOW OPEN AND UPWARD DIRECTED YOUR EYES ARE WILL INCREASE YOUR LEVELS OF ALERTNESS AND IF YOUR EYES ARE POINTED DOWNWARD AND YOUR EYELIDS ARE HOODED LIKE THEIR SLOWLY CLOSING LIKE COSTELLOS ARE ALWAYS ARE YOU WILL FEEL MORE SLEEPY ESPECIALLY FOR SOMEBODY WHO TENDS TO HAVE THAT MIDMORNING SLEEPINESS OR MIDMORNING CRASH SO WHAT I DO IS I HAVE A STANDING DESK BUT I ALSO PROP THE COMPUTER UP SUCH THAT IT'S AT LEAST AT EYE LEVEL AND I HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT YET HOW TO DEVELOP WORK STATION WHERE THE COMPUTER IS ABOVE ME I THINK THE ONLY WAY TO REALLY DO THAT IS ACTUALLY TO TILT ONE'S BODY BACK BUT ACTUALLY THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA EITHER THEY HAVE DONE STUDIES RECORDING FROM AREAS OF THE BRAIN ASSOCIATE WITH ALERTNESS AREAS LIKE LOCUS SERULIOUS AND THE SO CALLED RARTICULAR ACTIVATING SYSTEM THEY FOUND IS THAT DEPENDING ON HOW RECLINED YOU ARE OR UPRIGHT YOU ARE YOU WILL DECREASE WITH RECLINING AND INCREASE WITH SITTING FORWARD YOUR LEVELS OF ALERTNESS SO BODY POSTURE AND WHETHER NOT YOUR UPRIGHT OR RECLINING WILL IMPACT YOUR LEVELS OF ALERTNESS IN THE PREDICTABLE WAYS AND WHERE YOU POSITION YOUR EYES WHETHER NOT YOUR EYES AR UPRIGHT SO TO SPEAK LOOKING UP OR DIRECTLY FORWARD OR LOOKING DOWN WILL DICTATE WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE FEELING MORE ALERT OR MORE SLEEPY RESPECTIVELY SO TRY AND ARRANGE OF WORK STATION OR POSITION OF YOUR BODY IN YOUR CHAIR OR YOUR STANDING DESK WHATEVER IT IS THAT ALLOWS YOU TO WORK WITH THE HEIGHTENED STATE OF ALERTNESS THIS IS REALLY REALLY KEY FOR ME CAUSE I FOUND THAT WHEN I WOULD SIT DOWN NOT ONLY WHEN MY HIPFLEXERS START TO GET SORE I FEEL TIGHT IN THE BACK ET CETERA BUT IF I WAS STARING DOWN AT MY SCREEN ALL DAY OR EVEN FOR SHORT PERIODS OF THE DAY I WOULD START TO FEEL SLEEPY ND I CON FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON I ALSO THOUGHT MAY BE I NEED GLASS AS I DO WEAR READERS AT NIGHT BUT IT WAS REALLY A PROBLEM AND SIMPLY BY GETTING THE SCREEN DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME AT I LEVEL IT'S BEEN COMPLETELY TRANSFORMATIVE SO WHERE NOW AT THE DESCRIPTION OF MY DAY AND THESE PROTOCALS IN WHICH I WOULD DO A NINETY MINUTE BOUT OF WORK NOW WHY NINETY MINUTES WELL THE BRAIN IS GOING THROUGH THESE NINETY MINUTES SO CALLED ULTRADIAN CYCLES THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE DAY AND NIGHT EVERY NINETY MINUTES WE SHIFT OVER FROM BEING VERY ALERT TO BEING LESS ALLERT IN THE BACK TO LERT AGAIN HERE'S OUT WORKS WITHA START OF ONE IN THESE NINETY MINUTE ALTRADIAN CYCLES MY BRAIN IS NOT QUITE ENGAGED IN WHATEVER IT IS I'M TRYING TO DO AN OFTENTIMES I HAVE THINGS JUMPING INTO MY MIND I'VE GOT DISTRACTIONS AT CETERA I'LL TALK ABUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THOSE DISTRACTIONS IN A MOMENT BUT I SET A TIMER FOR NINETY MINUTES AND I TRIN GET A STRONG BOUT OF WORK DONE INSIDE OF THAT NINETY MNUTES WITH THE FULL UNDERSTANDING THAT THE ENTIRE NINETY MINUTES IS NOT GOING TO BE UNIFORM IN TERMS OF MY ABILITY OF FOCUS THERE WILL BE CAN A PEAKS IN VALLEYS WITHIN THAT BUT THAT NINETY MINUTES IS ABOUT WHAT THE BRAIN CAN HANDLE IN TERMS OF A DEDICATED EFFORT FOR HIGH DEGREE OF FOCUS SOME PEOPLE CAN PUSH OUT LOBIT FURTHER SOME PEOPLE CAN'T HANDLE MORE THAN TEN MINUTES BUT THAT'S WHAT I'M STRIVING TOWARD YOU BE AMAZED HOW MUCH YOU CAN GET DONE IN NINETY MINUTES IF YOU ARE FOCUS SO HOW DO YOU INCREASE THAT FOCUS AND HOW DO YOU USE THE THE TIMER FEATURE WELL YOU CAN COMBINE THOSE I USE A PROGRAMM CALLED FREEDOM IT SHUTS ME OUT OF THE INNERNETE COMPLETELY SO THAT MEANS NO CHECKING THE MARKETS NO CHECKING SOCIA MEDIA NO CHECKING AH YOU KNOW THAT THE NEWS NO CHECKING EMAL NONE OF THAT I GET A DEDICATED BOUT OF WORKDON I CONFESS I DON'T ALLOW MYSELF TO GO TO THE RESTARUM IN THAT PERIOD OF TIME HERE'S IT INTERESTING LITTLE TIT THAT'S GROUNDED IN PHYSIOLOGY YOU HAVE A DIRECT NORAL CONNECTION FROM YOUR BLATTER TO YOUR BRAINSTEM AREAS THAT INCREASE ALERTNESS THIS IS WHY WHEN YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM WHEN YOU HAVE TO URINATE IT IS EXTREMELY AGITATING MIT IT CAN BE VERY VERY AGITATING I'M NOT ENCOURAGING YOU TO YET SO AGITATED BY FILLING YOUR BLATTER SO MUCH AND RESISTIN GOING TO THE BATHROOM THAT YOU ARE UNCOMFORTABLE IN CAMP FOCUS BUT I GENERALLY WILL JUST DRINK LIQUIDS AND WORK AWAY AND WORK AWAY AND I WON'T WALK AWAY TO GO TO USE THE BATHROM UNLESS I ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO SOR ODD THEY WERE TALKING OUT THIS BUT THIS IS ONE WAY IN WHICH I'VE LEARNE TO FUNDL MY ATTENTION INTO WHATEVER IT IS I'M DOING BECAUSE AS YOU ALL KNOW THE MOMENT YOU SIT DOWN TO DO SOME SERIOUS WORK AND YOU FLIP OFF THE INNERNET AL OF A SUDDEN ITS AS IF THE PHONE HAS A VOICE IT STARTS CALLING YOU ITS ALMOST AS IF THE RESTARUM HAS A VOICE BUT WE ALL ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE FACT THAT IF WE ARE FOCUSED ON SOMETHING THAT ALL THAT JUST KIND OF MELTS AWAY SO THE GOAL IS TO GET INTO WHAT I CALL THE TUNNEL TO REALLY GET INTO A TUNNEL OF QUALITY WORK THE BRAIN LOVES THAT STATE BUT IT'S VERY HARD FROM ANY OF US TO ACCESS MY PHONE IS ABSOLUTELY OFF IT'S NOT ON AIROPLANE MOTE IT'S ABSOLUTELY OFF DURING THIS TIME IF I'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH THAT AND I CONFESS YOU KNOW THERE ARE TIMES WHEN FOR WHATEVER REASON SOMETHING GOING ON IN LIFE IT'S BEEN HARDER TO PUT AWAY THE PHONE I WILL SOMETIMES PUT IN MY CAR I USED TO JOKE THAT I USED TO THROW IT UP ON THE RUE FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THE I'VE DONE AND I SUGGEST PEOPLE DO WHATEVER THEY NEED TO IN ORDER TO IN SELF REGULATE THAT ACTIVITY AND IF YOUR SOMEBODY THAT FEELS THAT YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED TO BE ON YOUR PHONE AND ON THE COMPUTER FOR THIS WORK BOUT OR THE WORK THAT YOU DO OTHAT'S A DIFFERENT MATTER ALTOGETHER THIS IS JUST SIMPLY HOW I WORK SO I WILL DO NINETY MINUTES AND I DO SET OF TIMER AND I TURN ON THE PROGRAM FREEDOM LOCKS ME OUT OF THE INNER NET IF SOME ONE RINGS THAT ON THE DOOR BELL AH I WILL OFTEN SHOUT NOT COMING IN THE DOORBELT LEAVE IT THERE I MEAN UNLESS THERE'S AN REAL EMERGENCY I'M NOT GIN A STEP AWAY FROM THAT WORK I LEARNED HOW TO DO THIS WHEN I WAS A GRADUATESTONE UNDER DIFFERENT CONDITIONSWHERE I USE TO SLICE BRAINS ON WHAT'S CALL T A MICROTOME SO YOUSE TO SPEND TIME JUST CUTTING VERY THIN SLICES IS LIKE A DELLY SLICER BUT FOR A BRAIN OF AH VARIOUS TYPES OF BRAINS AND OF SECTION THROUGH A LOT OF BRAINS AND WE HAD A RULE WHICH IS THAT WHEN THE BLADE HITS THE BRAIN YOU DON'T STOP PULLING EVEN THOUGH IT'S VERY VERY SLOW EVEN OF A NEWCLEER BAM GOES OFF EVEN OF A FIRE ALARM GOES OFF NOW I DON'T WANT ANYONE YOU KNOW BURNING TO A CRISP BECAUSE AH THEY DIDN'T STEP AWAY FROM THEIR WORKFLOW THAT WOULD BE FOOLISH BUT THAT'S THE MENTALITY THAT I'VE IMBEDDED N MYSELF THAT THERE THERE IS NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT THEN WHAT I'M DOING IN THAT NINETY MINUTE BLOCK AND THAT'S WHAT WORKS FOR ME YOU CAN TRY VARIOUS OTHER THINGS THAT'S WHAT WORKS FOR ME IN ADDITION I USE LOW LEVEL WHITE NOISE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS SUPPORTED BY QUALITY PEEREVIEWED DATA RE COVER THIS ON THE EPISODE ON HEARING AND BALANCE BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT WHITE NOISE WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY ALL FREQUENCIES OF SOUND ERE ALL FREQUENCIES OF SOUND THAT WE CAN PERCEIVE MIXED UP KIND OF RANDOMLY THERE'S NO STRUCTURE TO IT TURNED ON AT A LOW VOLUME NOT WITH HEAD PHONES MOST OF THE TIME PUTS THE BRAIN INTO A STATE THAT'S OPTIMAL FOR LEARNING AND WORKFLOW AND I COVERD TWO PAPERS DURING THAT EPISODE ONE THAT SHOW THAT INDEED BRAIN AIR IS INVOLVED AN ATTENTION BRAIN AIR IS INVOLVED IN FOCUS AND COGNITION AND MEMORY THOSE ARE ENGAGED TO A GREATER DEGREE WHEN THERE IS LOW LEVELS OF WHITE NOISE PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND THE OTHER PAPER THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING DID BRAIN EMAGING AND SHOW THE AREAS OF THE BRAIN THAT ARE ASSOCIATE WITH DOPAMIN RELEASE HER INCREASE BY LOW LEVELS OF WHITE NOISE DOPAMIN RELEASE IS ASSOCIATED NOT JUST WITH PLEASURE BUT WITH MOTIVATION AND CRAVING SO EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS N INETY MINUTE BLOCK FROM THE LOW LEVELS A WHITE NOISE TO THE POSITION OF MY COMPUTER HOW I'M STANDING WHERE MY EYES OR POSITION IS GEARED TOWARDS PUTTING ME IN THIS TUNNEL OF WORK AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT WHILE IT CAN BE A CHALLENGE TO TRY AND ACHIEVE THIS STATE IN THIS TUNNEL OF WORK SOME DAYS YOU START TO GET KIND OF ADDICTED TO IT IT FEELS REALLY GOOD IT'S LIKE A WORK OUT FOR THE MIND AND IT A IS SOMETHING THAT AS YOU EXIT THAT NINETY MINUTES YOU REALLY FEEL LIKE YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED A LOT BECAUSE OFTEN UM YOU HAVE AND IT'S JUST FEELS DEEPLY SATISFYING AND I'M CONVINCE THAT THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE RELEASE OF NEROMODULATORS LIKE DOPOMENE AND THE A NORUP AN EFFERON THAT'S CIRCULATING IN YOUR SYSTEM AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT I'M NOT PERFECT ABOUT THIS NINETY MINUTES OCCASIONALLY I GET DRAWN AWAY OCCASIONALLY A SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN OR I'LL A GO USE THE RESTAURUM OR A COSTELLO WILL HAVE A NEED OR SOMEBODY WILL HAVE A NEED THAT I'LL THAT I WILL HAVE TO RESPOND TO BUT I REALLY TRYIND ACHIEVE THIS MOST IF NOT EVERY DAY THAT I'M ALIVE BECAUSE FOR ME THAT WORK SESSION IS KIND OF HOLLY IT'S WHERE I WHERE I SET UP A RELATIONSHIP NOT JUST BETWEEN ME AND THE WORK THAT I'M DOING BUT BETWEEN ME AND MY ABILITY TO CONTROLL MY OWN STATE OF MIND USING THESE VARIOUS SUPPORTS OF THE WHITE NOISE ET CETERA BUT REALLY THOSE SUPPORTS ARE PERIFERAL TO THE FACT THAT I'M CREATING THIS SPACE I'M FUNNLING MY BRAIN INTO A STATE RATHER THAN ALLOWING WHATEVER EVENTS AND CONTECTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND ELSEWHERE MIGHT BE OCCURRING IN THE WORLD THAT WOULD YANK ME OUT OF WHAT FOR ME IS MY PURPOSE AND MY MISSION IN LIFE WHICH IS TO DO THE SORTS OF WORK THAT I DO THERE'S A POWERFUL WAY IN WHICH YOU CAN PLACE THE TIMING OF THIS NINETY MINUTE WORKABOUT IN AN OPTIMAL WAY YOU HAVE ACCESS TO A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF DATA THAT DICTATES WHEN THIS BOUT SHOULD START MORE O LESS AND WHEN IT SHOULD END THAT PIECE OF DATA IS YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM IF YOURE SOMEBODY WHO WAKES UP ON AVERAGE AT SEVEN A M WELL THEN YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM IS FIVE A M AND YOU CAN BE REASONABLY SURE WHEN ION ER SQORE REASONABLY BUT YOU CAN BE REASONABLY SURE THAT YOUR BEST WORK IS GOING TO BE DONE ANYWHERE FROM FOUR TO SIX HOURS AFTER YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM SO FOR ME I TEND TO WAKE UP AROUND SIX THIRTY A M THAT MEANS MY TEMPERATURE MINIMUM IS AT FOUR THIRTY A M YOU CAN ADD FIVE HOURS TO THAT SO THAT MEANS THAT A NINETY MINUTE WORK BOUT COULD FALL AT NINE THIRTY A M AND IT WOULD BE FAIRLY OPTIMIZED OR I COULD DO IT AT TEN THIRTY A M OR I COULD DO IT AT EIGHT THIRTY M SOMEWHERE IN THERE I THAT WE CAN'T SAY THAT IT'S EXACTLY SIX HOURS AFTER YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM YOU WILL FIND IT HOWEVER THERE IS A PRECISE AND BEST TIME FOR YOU TO DO THIS NINETY MINUTE WORK ABOUT WHETHER NOT IT'S FIVE OR SIX HOURS AFTER YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM IS GOING TO VARY FROM PERSON TO PERSON HOW DO I KNOW THIS HOW DO I KNOW THIS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TEMPERATURE MINIMUM AND FOKUS COGNITION WELL TEMPERATURE MINIMUM DEFINDS THE TRO OFF THAT THE NADEER AS THEY SAY OF THE OF YOUR TEMPERATURE ACROSS THE TWENTY F R OUR CYCLE AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT YOUR TEMPERATURE WILL START TO RISE THAT TEMPERATURE RISE IS ACTUALLY WHAT TRIGGERS THE INITIAL CORTUS ALL RELEASE THAT YOU EXPERIENCE AND WAKES YOU UP FURTHER AND THEN OF COURSE THAT SUNLIGHT THAT YOURE GETTING IS GOING TO FURTHER ENHANCE THAT HEALTHY RELEASE OF CORTIS ALL THAT CORTERS ALL WILL THEN PROVIDE FUEL IF YOU WILL FOR THAT INCREASE IN TEMPERATURE AND YOUR BODY WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN TEMPERATURE THROUGHOUT THE DAY TOWARD THE AFTERNOON WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IN THIS IN THIS IDEA OF OPTIMIZING THIS NINETY MINUTE WORK BOUT TO PARTICULAR TIME A DAY IS CATCH THE PORTION OF THE STEEPEST SLOPE OF THAT TEMPERATURE RISE NOW AGAIN YOU'RE NOT WORK WALKING AROUND WITH A TTHE THERMOCOUPLE OR AN ATHERMOMETER OM IN SOME ORIFICE AR YOUR BODY S YOU DON'T HAVE ACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT TEMPERATURE BUT YOU CAN MAKE VERY GOOD GUESSES ABOUT WHEN YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE IS RISING FASTUS BY VIRTUE OF THAT TEMPERATURE MINIMUM SO AGAIN JUST TO BE CLEAR IT'S A NINETY MINUTE WORK BOUT THAT'S ABOUT WHAT THE BRAIN CAN HANDLE FOR A VERY INTENSE WORK ABOUT DO UNDERSTAND AGAIN THAT THERE CAN BE PORTIONS OF THAT NINETY MINUTE THAT YOUR BRAIN IS FLICKERING IN AN OUTO FOCUS OTHER PORTIONS WERE GOING TO BE ENTIRELY FOCAS THITS ENTIRELY NORMAL BUT WHEN TO PLACE THAT NINETY MINUTE WORK BOUT WHEN TO START IT AND WHEN TO END IT WILL DEPEND ON THAT TEMPERATURE MINIMUM SO IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO WAKES UP AT EIGHT A M EACH MORNING YOUR TEMPRATURE MINIMU SIX A M CHANCES ARE YOU'RE GOITOG ON O START THIS WORK BOUT SOMEWHERE AROUND TEN A M OR ELEVEN A M NOW SOME PEOPLE WAKE UP AND FEEL VERY ALERT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING THEY CAN REALLY DO THEIR BEST WORK FIRST THING IN THE MORNING PLEASE IF THAT'S YOU CONTINUE TO DO THAT LEVERAGE THAT TIME OUSE THAT TIME BUT IF YOU'R SOMEBODY WHO STRUGGLES TO FIND FOCUS DEFINITELY LET YOUR PHYSIOLOGY AND THIS RISE IN YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE SUPPORT YOUR EFFORTS TO FOCUS RATHER THAN TRYING TO DO YOUR BEST WORK AT TIMES OF DAY WHEN YOUR PHYSIOLOGY IS ACTUALLY DIRECTING YOUR BODY IN YOUR BRAIN TOWARD DEFOCUS AND TOWARDS BEING MORE LETHARGIC IT JUST IS SETTING YOURSELF UP FOR SUCCESS WHEN YOU TRYING CAPTURE THIS RISING PHASE OF YOUR TEMPERATURE SO UP UNTIL NOW WE'VE BEEN EMPHASISING PRACTICES THAT ALLOW YOU TO OPTIMIZE YOUR LEVEL OF ALERTNESS AND YOUR LEVELS OF MENTAL FOCUS DATO GOING BACK TO THE NINETEEN NINETIES SUPPORTS THE IDEA THAT PHYSICAL MOVEMENT OF PARTICULAR KINDS CAN SUPPORT BRAIN HEALTH AND BRAIN FUNCTION BOTH IN THE IMMEDIATE TERMINE IN THE LONG TERM NOW THIS IS AT A PROFOUND IMPACT ON THE FIELD OF NARROL SCIENCE BUT FRANKLY IT'S ALSO OUT OF PROFOUND IMPACT ON HOW I STRUCTURE MY DAY SO AFTER I'VE FINISHED A BOUT OF WORK THIS NINETY MINUTE BOUT OF WORK I FORCE MYSELF SOME DAYS OTHER DAYS I WANT TO BUT I FORCE MYSELF TO DO SOME SORT OF PHYSICAL EXERCISE THAT IS GOING TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF MY BRAIN HEALTH AND BRAIN FUNCTION AND ORGAN HEALTH AND BODILY FUNCTION IN GENERAL SO I JUST BRIEFLY WANT TO TOUCH ON WHAT THE STRUCTURE OF THAT EX ERCISE LOOKS LIKE HOW IT STRUCTURED WITHIN THE DAY AND HOW ITS STRUCTURED ACROSS THE WEEKS IN FACT BASED ON THE SCIENTIFIC DATA AND WHAT THE SCIENTIFIC DATA SAY IS BEST OR OPTIMAL IN ORDER TO PROMOTE LONGEVITY OF THE BRAIN ABILITY TO FOCUS AS WELL AS CARTIOVASCULAR HEALTH AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE KNOW EXERCISE SUPPORTS NOW THERE ARE VARIOUS FORMS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OR WHAT WE CALL EXERCISE BUT THOSE CAN GENERALLY BE BATCHED INTO TWO CATEGORIES FIRST IS STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHE WORK SO PHYSICAL MOVEMENTS THAT ARE DESIGNE TO MAKE YOU STRONGER AND OR MAKE YOUR MUSCLES LARGER THERE'S ALSO ENDURANCE WORK PHYSICAL EXERCISE AND MOVEMENTS THAT ARE DESIGN TO ALLOW YOU TO DO MORE WORK OVER TIME OR TO EXTEND THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT YOU CAN DO WORK OF ANY KIND BOTH PHYSICAL AND MENTAL AND WE DID TWO FULL POTCASTS EPISODES ON THE DETAILS AND THE SCIENCE AND THE PROTOCOLS RELATED TO THESE TOPICS WE DIDN'T EPISODE ON THE SCIENCE OF STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHE OF BUILDING STRENGTH AND MUSCLE BUILDING AND THAT INCLUDED A LOT OF PROTOCOLS AND WE DID AN EPISODE ON ENDURANCE HOW TO BUILD ANY ONE OR ALL OF THE FOR TYPES OF ENDURANCE WHICH ARE MUSCULAR NDURANCE ANEROBIC OROBIC LONG DISTANCE ENDURANCE ET CETERA SO F YOUARE INTERESTED IN THE SPECIFICS OF THOSE PROTOCALS PLE SEE THOSE EPISODES HOWEVER RIGHT NOW I JUST ONE TO EMPHICISE HOW THE DATA IMPACT MY DAY AND HOW I STRUCTURE MY DAY IN A WAY THAT I CAN INCORPORATE PHYSICAL MOVEMENT IN A WAY THAT SUPPORTS MYBRAIN AND HEALTH BASICALLY AFTER I FINISH THAT COGNITIVE WORK ABOUT THAT NINETY MINUTE WORKABOUT I DO SOME FORM OF PHYSICAL EXERCISE FOR ABOUT IN HOUR THE DATE ALL POINT TO THE FACT THAT WORKING OUT HARD FOR LONGER THAN AN HOUR CAN ACTUALLY BE DETRIMENTAL BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT IT RAISES QARTES ALL AND CUARTES ALL CAN BE A GOOD THING IF IT'S APPROPRIATELY TIMED AND IN THE APPROPRIATE LOW LEVELS BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE YOUR QUARTUS ALL LEVELS UP THROUGHOUT THE DAY OR HAVE BIG SPIKES OF CARTES ALL REPEATEDLY SO KEEPING WORK OUTS RELATIVELY SHORT CAN DEFINILLY HEALP WITH THAT AND CERTAINLY IF YOU ARE TRAINING HARD SIXTY MINUTES OR LESS SHOULD BE MORE THAN SUFFICIENT AND FOR MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF FORTY FIVE MINUTES OR FIFTY MINUTES AS PROBABLY EVEN MORE OPTIMAL THE BASIC DESIGN OF THIS PHYSICAL EXERCISE IS THAT IT BE APPROXIMATELY SIXTY MINUTES SO MAY BE SIXTY PLACERMINAS FIFTEEN MINUTES SHOULD BE WELL WITHIN THE MARGINS OF KEEPING HORMONAL HEALTH PROPER AND NOT GOING TOO LONG NOR MAKING THE WORK OUT SO SHORT THAT IT IS NOT BENEFICIAL AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT THE DATA TELL US IS THAT IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE CARTYVASCULAR AND BRAIN HEALTH AND OTHER SYSTEMS OF THE BODY WE WANT TO EXERCISE AT LEAST FIVE DAYS PER WEEK I KNOW THAT SEEMS LIKE A LOT A IT CERTAINLY IS A LOT FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE SOME OF YOU YOU A COMPULSIVE EXERCISERS A MIGHT GASP AT THE IDEA OF TAKING TWO DAYS OFF I PERSONALLY FIND THAT TAKING TWOFUL DAYS OFF POR WEAK IS ACTUALLY A BOTH BENEFICIAL TO MY A EXERCISE TRAINING PERFORMANCE AS WELL AS A PLEASANT I LIKE THOSE RESDAYS BUT ESSENTIALLY THE STRUCTURE OF THE EXERCISED REGIMENT THAT WORKS FOR SAKE OF SUPPORTING HEALTH IS GOINGTO BE ONE IN WHICH THERE IS A THREE TO TWO RATIO WHERE FOR A TWELVE WEEK PERIOD OR SO MAY BE TEN TO TWELVE WEEKS THREE OF THOSE FIVE WORK OUTS PER WEEK EMPHASISE STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHY AND THE OTHER TWO EMPHASISE IN DURANCE THEN AFTER TEN OR TWELVE WEEKS ONES WHICH IS OVER TO AT TEN OR TWELVE WEEK REGIMEN OF DOING AF THREE TO TWO RATIO WHERE YOUR PRIORATISING ENDURANCE WORK SO PRIMARILY THE SORTS OF WORK OUTS THAT ARE DESCRIBED IN THE ENDURANCE EPISODE AND THOSE PROTOCALS AND THE OTHER TWO DAYS YOUR FOCUSING ON STRENTH AND HYPERTROPHY WORK MERELY TO MAINTAIN STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHY DO NOT LOSE THE STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHY THAT YOU'VE CREATED AND THERE ARE A LOT OF DATA NOW SUPPORTING THE FACT THAT MAINTAINING MUSCULAR HEALTH IN BONE HEALTH IS SUPPORTED BY RESISTANCE TRAINING WEIGHT TRAINING OF VARIOUS KINDS CAN ALSO BE DONE WITH BODY WEIGHT IF YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO EQUIPMENT AND OF COURSE THAT DOING PARTY OF ASCULAR ENDURANCE WORK IS VERY BENEFICIAL BOTH TO THE MUSCLES OF THE BODY THE ORGANS OF THE BODY BUT ALSO TO THE BRAIN MANY VIEW OF PROBABLY HEARD THAT DOIN PHYSICAL EXERCISE OF VARIOUS KINDS CAN SUPPORT THE PRODUCTION OF NEW NURONS IN THE BRAIN FRANKLY THOSE DATA ARE SPECIFIC TO RESEARCH ANIMALS AS FAR AS WE KNOW INCREASES IN NURON NUMBER ARE NOT SUPPORTED BY EXERCISE IN HUMANS THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF DATA THAT SUPPORTS THAT MAY BE A FEW NURONS MIGHT GET CREATED BY RUNNING OR WEIGHT LIFTING OR THINGS THAT SORT IN HUMAN BEINGS BUT THERE STILL A HOST OF OTHER REASONS TO HAVE THIS HOUR OR SO PER DAY WHERE ONE IS DOING PHYSICAL EXERCISE AND THOSE INCLUDE INCREASE BLOOD FLOW TO THE BRAIN REMEMBER THE BRAIN IS AN ORGAN TOO ITS THE MOST METABOLICALLY TO DEMANDING ORGAN IN YOUR BODY AND ITS RECEIVING THOSE METABOLIC FACTORS ITS RECEIVING ITS FUELS BY WAY OF VASCULATURE OF BLOOD VESSELS AND CAPLARIES AN VAINS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT SO MOVEMENT IS VERY CRUCIAL TO GET YOUR BRAIN TO FUNCTION PROPERLY MOVEMENT OF VARIOUS KINDS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO GET YOUR BRAIN TO FUNCTION PROPERLY RESISTANCE TRAINING TURNS OUT TO BE AS IMPORTANT AS INDURANCE TRAINING BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT IT STIMULATES THE RELEASE OF PARTICULAR HORMONES EXTUALLY FROM BONES THINGS LIKE OSTIAL CALSIN WHICH CAN POSITIVELY INPACT BRAIN FUNCTION AND CAN SUPPORT THE HEALTH OF EXISTING NURONS AS SUPPOSED TO INCREASING THE NUMBER OF NURONS TURNS OUT INCREASING THE NUMBER OF NURONS MAY NOT ACTUALLY BE AS BENEFICIAL AS WE THINK IT ALL SOUNDS GREAT MORE NURONS MORE NURONS CERTAINLY MORE NURONS IS BETTER THAN FEWER NURONS AND LOSING NURNS BUT INCORPORATING NEW NURONS INTO EXISTING BRAIN CIRCUITRY IS ASSU VERY CHALLENGING FOR THE BRAIN TO DO I MAKE SURE THAT AFTER THAT WORK BOUT I GET THIS ONE HOUR OR SO OF EXERCISE FIVE DAYS PER WEEK BECAUSE OF THE WAYS THAT IT SUPPORTS MYT GENERAL HEALTH AND THERE ARE NOW HUNDREDS OF STUDIES SUPPORTING THE FACT THAT BOTH INDURANCE WORK END STRENGTH TR AINING OR HYPERTROPHY TRAINING DONE INCOMMINATION MEANING NOT NECESSARILY IN THE SAME WORK OUT BUT DONE ACROSS THE WEAK IS IMMENSELY BENEFICIAL FOR THE PRODUCTION OF THINGS LIKE BRAINDRIVE NEUTROPHIC FACTOR FOR LIMITING  INFLAMATORY SETA KINDS LIKE IELL SIX FOR PROMOTING ANTINE FLAMMATORY CITA KINDS LIKE IEL TEN PROVIDED THAT EXERCISES OF THE PROPER DURATION AND THAT IT'S NOT SO INTENTS THAT YOUR ACTUALLY CREATING DAMAGE TO THE VARIOUS SYSTEMS OF THE BODY NOW WHERE IS THE THRESHOLD BETWEEN OPTIMAL A SUBTHRESHOLD AND DETRIMENTAL THIS IS THAT THIS IS A COMPLICATED A THEME IF WE DON'T PUT SOME STRUCTURE AROUND IT SO TIT'S PUTTALOBAA STRUCTURE ROUND IT WE ALWAYS SAID THAT ABOUT SIXTY MINUTES SO SIXTY MINUTES PLUSERMINUS FIFTEEN MINUTES IS GOING TO BE OPTIMAL FOR ALL THESE HEALTH BENEFITS WHAT ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THE ACTUAL WORKOUTS WELL WE NEED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE OF INTENSITY A GOOD RULE OF THUM BASED ON THE LITERATURE AND I DISCUSS THIS WITH DOCTOR ANDIGALPIN PRIOR TO THE STRANGTH AND HYPERTROPHY IN THE DURANCE EPISODES AND THE LITERATURE THAT'S PUBLISHED IN QUALITY PERE REF UJURNALS REALLY POINTS TO THE FACT THAT APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE RESISTANCE TRAINING YOU DO SHOULD BE RESISTANCE TRAINING THAT DOESN'T GO TO WHAT THEY CALL FAILURE WHERE YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY MOVE THE RESISTANCE ANY MORE THE OTHER TWENTY PER CENT CAN BE OF THE HIGHER INTENSITY TO FAILURE TYPE TRAINING NOW WITH RESPECT TO ENDURANCE WORK ONE CAN BUILD UP ENDURANCE WITHOUT HAVING TO LOG LONG LONG MILEGE OR EXTENSIVE MILAGE IN THE POOLER OR BY RUNNING NOT'S BECAUSE THERE ARE THESE OTHER FORMS OF ENDURANCE THAT CAN BUILD UP FOR INSTANCE THE CAPLARY BEDS WITHIN THE MUSCLES BUILDING UP THE CAPULARY BEDS WITHIN THE MUSCLES WILL ALLOW MORE OXYGEN UTILIZATION WITHIN THE MUSCLES AND THEREBY WILL INCREASE YOUR ENDURANCE BOTH OF THE MUSCLES BUT ALSO WILL IMPROVE BRAINMETABOLISM AND THE WAY THAT THE HEART FUNCTIONS OF CARDIOFASCULAR FUNCTION THAT EIGHTY TWENTY RULE OF LESS THAN FAILURE AND WORK TO FAILURE IN THE RESISTANCE EXERCISE REGIME CAN BE TRANSPORTED OR TRANSLATE TO THE ENDURANCE EXERCISE PORTION BY FOCUSING ON THAT THING THAT WERE FAMILIAR WITH WHICH IS THE BURN WHEN WERE RUNNING HARD OR CYCLING HARD WE'LL EXPERIENCE A KIND OF BURNING OF THE MUSCLES THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH THELACTATE SYSTEM DURING THE EPISODA EN DURANCEIE POINTED OUT THAT THAT BURN IS NOT LACTIC ACID CONTRARY TO COMMON BELIEF IT IS NOT LACTIC ACID IT'S A SOCIATE WITH LACTATE METABOLISM IN AGAIN ABOUT EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE ENDURANCE WORK SHOULD NOT INCORPORATE THAT SO CALLED BURN BUT IF TWENTY PER CENT OF THAT WORK OR SO ISHOULS A APPROXIMATELY TWENTY PER CENT OF THAT WORK DOES INCLUDE THAT SO CALLED BURNING SENSATION THAT BURNING SENSATION ACTUALLY TRIGGERS THE ACTIVATION OF RELEASE OF CERTAIN COMPOUNDS AND MOLECULES FROM GLEA THIS BRAIN CEL TYPE THAT SUPPORTS NOR ON HEALTH AND ACTUALLY THAT LACTATE SYSTEM IS ITS OWN FORM OF FUEL FOR THE BRAIN AND SO THERE IS INCREASING INTEREST IND GENERATING THE LACKTATE OR PUSHING PAST THAT LACKTAKE THRESHOLD FOR SMALL PORTION TWENTY PER CENT OR SO OF ENDURANCE WORK IN ORDER TO SUPPORT BRAIN HEALTH AND FUNCTION SO WHAT IS ALL THIS ALL LOOK LIKE AS A PROTOCAL WELL AS I MENTION BEFORE THIS THREE TO TWO RATIO SO MAYBE YOU SPEND A TEN WEEKS OR SO OR TWELVE WEEKS OR SO FOCUSSING MAINLY ON ENDURANCE WORT THREE WORK OUTS PER WEEK ON ENDURANCE WORK EIGHTY PER CENT OF THOSE WORK OUTS MEANING ING TO PER CENT THE TIME YOUR BELOW THAT BURN THRESHOLD YOU ARE NOT EXPERIENCING A BURNING SENSATION BUT THAT FOR TWENTY PER CENT OF IT YOU ARE THAT BASED ON THE SCIENTIFIC DATA SHOULD SUPPORT LACTATE MATABOLISM BRAIN HEALTH ET CETERA AS WELL AS CARTY OF ASCULAR HEALTH AND OXYGENUALIZATION ALL THE FORMS OF OF ENDURANCE THAT WE'RE AWARE OF AND THEN THE OTHER TWO WORK OUTS WOULD INVOLVE RESISTANCE TRAINING AGAIN WITH THIS EIGHTY TWENTY SPLIT WHERE EIGHT TY PER CENT THE WORK IS NOT TO FAILURE AND TWENTY PER CENT IS AND THEN MAY BE AFTER TEN TWELVE WEEKS YOU SWITCH WHERE YOU START EMPHASIZING STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHE WORK FOR THREE OF THE WORK OUTS AND ENDURANCE WORK FOR TWO OF THE WORKOUTS NOW OF COURSE SOME OF YOU WILL BE ABLE TO TRAIN SIX DAYS A WEEK OR YOU'LL COMPULSIVELY NING TO TRAIN SEVEN DAYS A WEEK IF YOU DECIDE TO DO THAT PLEASE BE AWARE THAT THIS CORTIS ALL THRESHOLD IS A REAL THING SO FOR ME THE THREE TO TO RATIO WORKS OUT PERFECTLY CAUSE I LIKE TWOFUL DAYS OFF A WEEK WHEN I TAKE THOSE REALLY DEPENDS ON MY SCHEDULE AND HOW I AM FEELING SOMETIMES ATS TWO DAYS IN ROW SOMETIMES THEIR INTERESPIRS HROUGHOUT THE WEEK BUT IN RE VIEWING THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE FOR THOSE TWO EPISODES OF THE PODCAST AND IN TALKING TO PEOPLE ARE REALLY INFORMED IN THE WORLD OF RESISTANCE TRAINING AND ENDURANCE TRAINING AND HOW THAT RELATES TO BRAIN HEALTH AND BODY HEALTH THIS SEEMS TO BE THE MOST RATIONAL IN GROUND ID PROTOCALSO THAT'S THE ONE THAT I FOLLOW SO ON ANY GIVEN DAY I FINISH THAT WORK BLOCK AND I TRAIN I DO SOME SORT OF RESISTANCE OR ENDURANCE TRAINING I PUT THOSE ON ALTERNATE DAYS OR DIFFERENT DAYS RATHER SO WE'VE NOW TALKED ABOUT THE ARK THAT SPANDS ALL THE WAY FROM WAKING TO A MORNING BOUT OF FOCUST WORK TO PHYSICAL TRAINING I HAVE NOT MENTIONED INGESTING ANYTHING OR NUTRIANCE ONE OF THE MOST COMMON QUESTIONS I GET ER WHAT SHOULD I EAT FOR MY BRAIN WELL AM IRONICALLY ENOUGH A ONE OF THE BESTINGS YOU CAN DO FOR YOUR BRAIN IS DO NOT EAT BUT OF COURSE WE ALL HAVE TO EAT SOONER OR LATER AND EATING IS WONDERFUL I ABSOLUTELY LOVE EATING I EVEN ENJOY THE MERE ACT OF CHEWING BUT THE QUESTION OF WHAT TO EAT IS AN IMPORTANT ONE AS IT RELATES TO BRAIN HEALTH AND BRAIN FUNCTION BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT THAT I ONE EMPHASIZE THAT TRAINING FAST ID ACTUALLY HAS SOME IMMEDIATE AND LONG TURN BENEFITS PRIOR TO HAVING MY LABIT STAMFORD I WAS DOWN IN SANDIEGO AT YOU SEE SANDIEGO AND AT AN APPOINTMENT THE SALK INSTOTWU TO BIOLOGICAL STUDIES IAD A CALLIG THERE BY THE NAME OF SUCH IN PANDA HOU WROTE A WONDERFUL BOOK CALLE THE CIRCADIAN CODE YOU RUNS A SERIOUS BIOLOGY LABORATORY FOCUSSING ON MATABOLISM CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS AND SO FORTH AS WELL AS THE EFFECTS OF FAST ING SACHIN AND HIS BOOK THE CIRCADIUM CODE DESCRIBE HOW ENGAGING AN PHYSICALLEXERCISE WHILE FASTED CAN AMPLIFY THE EFFECTS OF THAT EXERCISE NOT JUST FORSAKE OF INCREASING THE PERCENTAGE OF THINGS LIKE BODY THAT BURNED ET CETERA BUT FOR CELLER HEALTH LIVER HEALTH AND THE HEALTH OF OTHER ORGANS SO WEARE POSSIBLE I DO STRIVE TO DO MY WORK OUT WITH OUT EATING ANYTHING FIRST HOWEVER SOME DAYS I'M VERY VERY HUNGRY AND SO I DO INJEST WATER WHICH CONTAINS ELECTROLYTES SO THAT MEANS SODIUM MAGNESIAN POTASSIUM FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT SODIU MAGNESIUM POTASSIUM ARE REQUIRED FOR NORANTS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY IT'S PART OF THE WAY THEY GENERATE ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY AS WELL INJESTING ELECTROLITES FOR ME CAN QUELL HUNGAR THIS POINTS TO A WHOLE OTHER TOPIC WE COUL DO ANOTHER EPISODE ON AT SOME POINT WHICH IS MANY TIMES PEOPLE THINK THAT THEIR BLOOD SUGAR IS LOW AND ACTUALLY THAT'S NOT THE CASE A AND FRANKLY ONE WOULDN'T WANT THEIR BLOOD SUGAR TO BE HIGH YOU DON'T WANT YOUR BLOODSUGAR TO LOWBUT YOU ALSO DON'T WANT IT TO HIGH VERY LOW BLOOD SUGAR IS TERRIBLE BUT LOWISH BLOOD SUGAR TENDS TO GIVE US A SENSE OF MENTAL CLARITY AND FOCUS RELATE TO THIS ADRENALENCE AS A PHENOMENO THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON EXERCISE OR WORK OR ANYTHING ELSE YOU NEED SUFFICIENT ELECTROLYTES AND SO MANY PEOPLE FIND THAT IF THEY SIMPLY INJEST SOME WATER WITH SALT MAY BE A NINETY NINE MILIGRAM POTASSIUM TABLET OLL A SUDN THEY FEEL VERY MENTALLY CLEAR AND ABLE TO DO PHYSICAL WORK IN MENTAL WORK WHAT I DO IS PRIOR TO THIS A MORNING EXERCISE ALTHOUGH IT'S NOW LATE MORNING IN THIS A WAY I'M DESCRIBING IT AND TYPICALLY IT DOES OCCUR LATE MORNING HOWHAVE SOME WATER WITH EITHER SO LO MAY BE HALF ATESPOON OF SEASALT WITH NINETY NINE MILIGRAM POTASSIUM TABLET OR THESE DAYS I'M FOND OF TAKING O WHAT'S CALLED ELEMENT ELEM ANT ELEMENT I LEARND ABOUT THIS FROM LECS FREEDMEN'S PODCASSINOMANY OF YOUR FAMILIAR WITH LECS EXCELLENT PARDCASSICSELLENT SCIENTIST A I DON'T HAVE ANY BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP TO ELEMENT THEY'RE NOT A SPONSE OF THE PODCAST BUT ELEMENT IS A PRODUCT THAT ESSENTIALLY CONTAINS ELECTROLITE SODIUM POTASSIUM AS WELL AS MAGNESIUM MALLETE WHICH HAS BEEN SHOWN TO OFFSET THINGS LIKE THELATE ON SET MUSCLE SORENESS THAT FORMER MAGNESIUM DOESN'T MAKE PEOPLE DROWSY IT'S NOT AN ANXILIOTIC LIKE SOME OF THER FORMS A MAGNESIUM AND ANSILIOTIC IS JUST ONE THAT REDUCES ANXIETY SO WHETHER NOTS ELEMENT OR WHETHER NOT U E JUST PUTTING A LITEBIT OF SALT IN TO AS SOME WATER IN INJESTING THAT PRIOR TOR TRAINING THAT CAN BE AN EXCELLENT WAY TO INSURE THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO COMPLETE THE PHYSICAL LEXERCISE A EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVEN'T EATEN ANYTHING AND I CONFESS SOME DAYS I WILL EAT A LO BIT BEFORE MY WORK OUT A JUST BECAUSE I CAN'T SEEM TO RESIST EATING I WANTIMENTION THE USE OF STIMULANTS BEFORE PHYSICAL TRAINING THIS HAS CERTAIN BENEFITS AND CERTAIN DRAWBACKS THE BENEFITS ARE SOMETIMES IT CAN FACILITATE MOTIVATION BECAUSE THINGS LIKE CAFINE CAN INCREASE THE RELEASE OF DOPOMINE CAN INCREASE THE RELEASE OF APINEPRON CAN REDUCE THAT A DENIZINE LEVEL IN THE BLOOD STREING SO SOME PEOPLE YUSE CAFFINE BEFORE TRAINING AN WAYS THAT BENEFIT THEM IT CAN ALSO INCREASE FATOXIDATION AND AND OF FATMATABOLISM THINGS IF THAT'S YOUR GOAL I AM NOT A PARTICULAR FAN OF INJESTING STIMULANTS BEFORE TRAINING BECAUSE OF A WHOLE SET OF PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH MOST FORMS OF STIMULANTS IN THE FORM OF ENERGY DRINKS ET CETERA I AM NOT A FAN OF ENERGY DRINKS I DID IT A DECENT PORTION OF A PREVIOUS EPISODE ON FOOD AND MOOD ON ENERGY DRINKS AND SOME OF THE DETRIMENTAL THINGS THEY CONTAIN RATHER I TRY AND TRAIN SIMPLY BY INJESTING THE CAFFINE SOURCES I MENTION BEFORE ARE YOU SA MATE SOME ELECTROLITES SOME WATER OCCASIONALLY I'LL HAVE AN ASPRESSO OR CUP OF COFFEE BEFORE I TRAIN AND ON RARE OCCASIONS I SHOULD EMOCISE RARE OCCASIONS IF I REALLY NEED HELP INCREASING MY MOTIVATION OR I DECIDE I WANT O PUSH EXTREMELY HARD I WILL IN JEST SOMETHING LIKE ALPHAG P C ALPA G P C SUPPORTS THE RELEASE OF A NERMODULATOR CALLED A SEATO COLINE SO THREE HUNDRED MELOGRAMS OF ALPHA G P C HAS BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE BUT ALSO COGNIVE PERFORMANCE SOME PEOPLE MIGHT NOT BE INTERESTED IN INJESTING ANYTHING TO IMPROVE THEIR PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE OR ANYTHING AT ALL BUT THEY MIGHT BE ADDRESSING HOW THEY CAN INIMPROVE COGNIVE PERFORMANCE AND FOCUS AND ALPHA G P C IS A NON STIMULANT WAY TO APPROACH THAT AGAIN DEFILLING CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE ON TAKING ANYTHING OR STOPPING TO TAKE ANYTHING BUT ALPHAG P C HAS BEEN SHOWN IN VARIOUS STUDIES TO IMPROVE COGNIVE PERFORMANCE AND IN PEOPLE WHO HAVE AGURLAY COGNIVE DECLINE IT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME POSIIVE BENEFITS REPORTED IN QUALITY PURE REVU JOURNALS IF YOU WANT EXPLORE THOSE REFERENCES PLEASE GO TO EXAMINE OT CALM GO PLEASE PUT ING ALPHA G P C GO TO THE HUMAN AFFECT MATRIXS AND THERE YOU CAN FIND DETAILS OF THOSE STUDIES REFERENCES TO POM MENT ET CETERA SO LET'S TALK ABOUT FOOD TIMING FIRST AS I MENTION I EAT MY FIRST MEAL SOME TIME AROUND NOON PLUSERMINUS AN HOUR FOR THE REASONS WE'VE DISCUSSED THE VOLUME OF FOOD IS ALSO IMPORTANT IF YOU EAT A LARGE VOLUME OF ANYTHING BECAUSE IT DIVERTS BLOOD TO YOUR GOT YOU WILL FEEL LETHARGIC AND YOU WILL HAVE LESS BLOOD GOING TO YOUR BRAIN AT SEEMS LIKE A SIMPLE AND TRIVIAL FACT BUT IF YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO THINK YOU CAN'T INJEST LARGE VOLUMES OF ANYTHING INTO YOUR GOT SO THE DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT FOODS GIVE YOU ENERGY IS KIND OF MOOT IF YOU EAT ENORMOUS VOLUMES OF THAT FOOD NOW THE VOLUMES ARE GING TO DEPEND ON YOU AND YOUR NEEDS AN YOUR ACTIVITY LEVELS IAM GOING TO DISCUSS WHAT I DO IN TERMS OF FOOD CONTENT BUT I AM NOT GOING TOISCUST FOOD VOLUME I A SORT OF KNOW WHERE THAT MOSTLY FULL LIKE EIGHTY PERCENT FULL LINE IS AND I USUALLY EAT ALOL BIT PAST THAT FRANKLY AND I'M ABLE TO MAINTAIN A DECENT DEGREE OF ALERTNESS INTO THE AFTERNOON AND THAT'S MY GOAL AND I THINK THAT'S THE GOAL OF MOST PEOPLE TO NOT WORK OUT IN THE MORNING OR DO SOME WORK AND THEN JUST COLLAPSE INTO A SL LUMBER THAT LASTS ALL AFTERNOON BUT TO BE ABLE TO GENERATE ALERT CALM FOCUSTATES THROUGHOUT THE DAY SO FOR LUNCH I DO EMPHASIZE SLIGHTLY LOWER CARBOHYDRATE OR LOW CARBOHYDRATE AN TAKE FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT A DRENOLINE AND DOPOMENE AND THER ASSOCIATE NAUROMODULATORS ARE GOING TO SUPPORT ALERTNESS SO FOR ME I FAST UP UNTIL ABOUT NOON THEN I EAT ALUNCH THAT CONSISTS OF SOME SORT OF PROTINE THING LIKE A SOME MEAT OR SOME CHICKEN OR SOME SAMIN AND SOME VEGETABLES ET CETERA AND IF I'VE EXERCISED PREVIOUSLY WHICH I DO AS I MENTION FIVE DAYS A WEEK THEN I WILL INGEST SOME STARCHES ALL INGESTSOM RED OR BREADSCUVES ME OR RICE OR OTMEAL AND BUTTER AN NUTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT I WILL CONSUME THE VARIOUS FOOD GROUPS AS THEY SAY BUT I WILL KEEP THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF CARBOHYDRATE A LITTLE BIT ON THE LOW SIDE OR IF I HAVEN'T TRAINED I WON'T HAVE ANY CARBOHYDRATE AT ALL NOT BECAUSE I'M QITOGENIC NOT BECAUSE I'N INTERCARBOHYDRATE NOT BECAUSE I'M ON A PURE CARNIVOR DITE FAR FROM IT BUT BECAUSE STARCHES CAUSE THE RELEASE OF CERETONAN IN THE BRAIN AND LEND THEMSELVES TO A STATE OF SLEEPINESS NOW I SHOULD MENTION THAT ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF INDIVIDUALS HAVE GENES THAT INCODE FOR ENZIMES THAT ALLOW THEM TO EAT LARGE AMOUNTS OF CARBOHYDRATE AND NOT SUFFER FROM THIS LETHARGY THIS CAN OSEDATION FROM CARBOYDRATES BUT I DON'T HAVE THAT GENE AND SO FOR ME EATING A NON ISH MEAL THAT IS NOT ENORMOUS BUT IS DECENT IN SIZE BUT THAT IS MAINLY PROTINE HEALTHY FATS AND LOWISH CARBOHYDRATES ARE NO CARBOHYDRATES IS WHAT ALLOWS ME TO ACHIEVE HEIGHTENED STATES OF ALERTNESS THROUGHOUT THE DAY WHICH IS WHAT I NEED FOR MY PURPOSIS SO JUST KNOWING THAT MEATS AND NUTS SUPPORT ALERTNESS PROVIDED YONY TOO MUCH OF THEM THAT VEGETABLES ARE HEALTHY FOR US AND THERE FOR WESHOULD EAT THEM AND I HAPPEN TO LIKE THEM AS WELL AND THAT CARBOHYDRATES TEN TO HAVE A KIND OF SEDED TO LIKE QUALITY TO THEM THAT SHOULD HELP YOU AND A GUIDE YOUR FOOD CHOICIS IN AN INTELLIGENT WAY THAT'S GROUNDED IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE AS IT RELATES TO ALERTNESS NOW WHAT ABOUT COMPONENTS OF FOODS THAT ARE NOT ABOUT ALERTNESS BUT ARE ABOUT MOOD WE DID ENTIRE EPISODE ON MOOD AND FOOD AND ITS VERY CLEAR BASED ON NOW DOZENS OF STUDIES THAT IN GESTING SUFFICIENT LEVELS OF OMEGA THREE PHATIACIS IS GOING TO SUPPORT HEALTHY MOOD AND EVEN CAN ACT AS AN ANTI DEPRESCNTS MORE THAN A DOZEN STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT IN GESTING AT LEAST ONE THOUSAND MELIGRAMS PER DAY OF THE E P A FORM OF ESSENTIAL PHATIAID IS AS EFFECTIVE AS PRESCRIPTION AN TI DEPRESCINTS IN RELIEVING DEPRESSION AND IF YOURE SOMEBODY WHO REQUIRES PRERSCRIPTION ANTO DEPRESSINS PROSACS ALOFT ET CETERA IT CAN ALLOW PEOPLE TO TAKE LOWER DOSES OF THOSE MEDICATIONS WHICH IN MANY CASES IS A POSITIVE THING OR A GOOD THING TO DO BECAUSE OF THE CIDE THAT PROFILES THAT MANY OF THOSE TRUGS CARRY SO I FIND THESE DATA REMARKABLY COMPELLING AND  HERE WE HAVE A FOOD OR A SUBSTANCE FROM FOOD THAT CAN IMPROVE OUR MOOD AND OUR SENSE OF WELL BEING AND IT DOES THAT BY WAY OF INCREASING CERTAIN NERMODULATORS IN THE BRAIN IN PARTICULAR DOPOMINE BUT ALSO SOME OTHER RELATED NOR MOTULATORS SO IF YOU ARE EATING FATTY SAMON REGULARLY IF YOU ARE EATING CRILL REGULARLY MEANING IF YOURO A AA WAIL IF YOU ARE A INJESTING FOODS THAT TEN TO HAVE A LOT OF O MEGATHREES YOU PROBABLY DON'T NEET TO SUPPLEMENT WITH O MEGA THREE MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT INJESTING SUFFICIENT LEVELS OF A MEGA THREES AND I'M CERTAINLY ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE DESPITE AN EFFORT TO EAT GOOD FOODS AND WHOLE FOODS AT CETERA AND UNPROCESS FOODS I HAVE MADE THE CHOICE TO INJEST AT LEAST A THOUSAND MILIGRAMS PERDAY OF E PE I DO THAT IN THE FORM OF FISHOL AND E P A D  CH A A COMMINATION FISH OIL BUT THE BUT THE THRESHOLD OF A THOUSAND MILIGRAMS IS NOT A THOUSAND MILIGRAMS OF FISH OIL IT'S A THOUSAND MILIGRAMS OF E P A NOW FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DON'T WANT TO CONSUME FISH OILS AND PREFERRED TO GET YOURE MEGATHRES FROM NON ANIMAL SOURCES THERE ARE NON ANIMAL SOURCES VARIOUS FORMS OF ALGY AT CETERA YOU CAN JUST LOOK THAT UP ON LINE AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND THAT THERE ALSO A NUMBER OF FOODS THAT INCLUDE THESE ESSENTIAL MEGA THREES WE DID AN EPISODE ON FOOD AND MOOD WHERE I GOING TO MORE DETAIL THAN YOU COULD EVER WANT ON THAT AS WELL AS A SOME ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIENTS WE ALSOT ID AN EPISODE ON THIEROID FUNCTION THIS HORMOM IT'S IMPORTANT FROR MATABOLISM AND THAT POINTED TO THE IMPORTAANCE OF GETTING SUFFICIENT IODINE WHICH YOU SHOULD NATURALLY GET FROM THE SALTS YOU'R INJESTING PROVIDED YOUR INJESTING ENOUGH SALT I'M NOT SOMEBODY WHO EATS A LOT IC HELP UM BUT OR SEE WEAT ALTHOUGH I DON'T MIND THE TASTE ES HE WEED I DON'T INJEST IT REGULARLY BUT INJESTING SUFFICIENT CELENIUM OR CYLLINIUM HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE IMPORTANT FOR PROPER THIEROID PRODUCTION THIEROID FUNCTION WHICH IS WHY I TEND TO EAT A FEW BRAZIL NUTS EACH DAY TYPICALLY WITH MY LUNCH OR SOMETIMES BEFORE MY WORK OUT DOESN'T REALY MATTER THE POIN IS THAT THE VOLUME THE AMOUNT THE CONTENT AND INDEED THE RATIOS OF PROTINE DO VAT TO CARBOHIDRATES ARE GOING TO IMPACT HOW YOU FEEL AND THEY'RE GOING TO IMPACT YOUR BRAIN HEALTH AND OF COURSE THE TIMING WE KNOW THAT ALLOWING PERIODS OF TWELVE HOURS OR MORE EACH TWENTY FOUR HOUR CYCLE WHERE YOU'RE NOT INJESTING ANYTHING IS BENEFICIAL FOR YOUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH THAT'S WITH SUCH AM PANDA AND HIS COLLEAGUES WORK HAS SHOWN OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN THESE QUALITYS STUDIES SO WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME YOU WHAT SHOULD I EAT FOR MY BRAIN MORE OFTEN THAN NOT IT'S REALLY A QUESTION OF HOW YOUR STRUCTURING YOUR DAY WHEN YOURE EATING FOR THE FIRST TIME HOW LONG YOU AR ALLOWING YOURSELF TO FAST EACH TWENTY FOR HOUR CYCLE AND ALSO WHETHER NOT YOU'RE GETTING SUFFICIENT O MEGATHREES WHETHER NOT YOU'RE GETTING SUFFICIENT CYLINIUM TO SUPPORT THINGS LIKE THIEROID FUNCTION WHICH HAS AN IMPACT BOTH ON THE ATABOLISM OF THE BODY BUT ALSO THE METABOLISM IN THE BRAIN AND WHEN I SAY METABOLISM I DON'T JUST MEAN BURNING ENERGY ACTUALLY MEAN THE REBUILDING OF THINGS SO IN THE EPISODE ON GROWTH HORMON AND THIDERAT HORMON WE TALKED ABOUT HOW METABOLISM MEANS NOT JUST THE BREAK DOWN OF FATS AND CARBOYDRATES BUT ALSO THE BUILDING UP THE REPAIR OF MUSCLE TISSUE THE REPAIR OF BONE THE REENFORCING OF BONE END THE REPAIR AND THE BUILD UP OF BRAIN TISSUE AND SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT I EMPHASIZE BECAUSE THEY ARE SO STRONGLY SUPPORTED BY THE SCIENTIFIC DATA DONE IN MICE STUDY IS DONE IN HUMANS AND BASICALLY THERE'S A LOT OF BIO CHEMICAL EVIDENCE THAT SUPPORTS EVERYTHING THAT I JUST DESCRIBED ALONG THE LINES OF HEALTH AND WELL BEING I BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T MENTION HORMONES HORMONES HAVE BROAD EFFECTS ON THE BODY IN BRAIN WE DID AN ENTIRE MONTH ON HORMONES IF YOU WANT TO HEARABOUT ANY OF THOSE HORMONES IN DETAIL WE TALKED ABOUT TESTSTRON AND OPTOMIZING TESTOSTRON ESTROGEN ET CETERA THE SEX STEROID HORMONS WHICH INCLUDE TESTOSTRON AND ESTROGEN WHICH YOUR COURSE ARE PRESENT IN VARYING RATIOS BUT IN BOTH MEND AND WOMEN AND IN KIDS THEY ARE MANUFACTURED FROM COLLESTRAL WE HEAR ABOUT COLLESTRAL IS THIS TERRIBLE THING BUT THEY ACTULLY MADE FROM COLESTRAL AND SO IF YOU DON'T GET SUFFICIENT LEVELS OF COLESTRALL THAT CAN BE PROBLEMATIC FOR YOUR HORMONS AND THAT CAN BE PROBLEMATIC FOR YOUR BRAIN IN YOUR BODY HEALTH SO WITHOUT GOING INTO TOO MUCH DETAIL I'LL JUST POINT TO A COUPLEOF THINGS THAT I DO THAT AT LEAST FROM MY BLOOD WORK AND FROM MY SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE HAVE BEEN VERY BENEFICIAL FOR ME THAT SOME OF YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER FIRST OF ALL I AM NOT SHY ABOUT MY LOVE FOR BUTTER I WILL EAT PATS OF BUTTER DIRECTLY I BELIEVE TAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO EAT CHEESE WITHOUT A CRACKER I WILL EAT BUTTER WITHOUT A CRACKER BUTTER IS HIGH IN COLLESTRAL SO I DON'T EAT A TON OF IT BUT AT LEAST FOR ME AND FOR MY LIPID PROFYLES ITS FINE BUTTER HAS COLESTRAL WHICH IS A PRECURSER TO THE SEXTORID HORMONES AND MEN AND WOMEN NEED TESTOSTRON AND ESTROGEN IN ORDER TO FEEL GOOD AND TO BE ABLE TO THINK YOU DO NOT WANT YOUR ESTROGEN TOO LOW OR YOUR TESTOSTRONE TOO LOW SO I EAT BUTTER IN ORDER TO INSURE THAT I GET SUFFICIENT COLESTRAL BUTTER ALSO HAS SOME OTHER THINGS THAT ARE BENEFICIAL VARIOUS SMALL FATIACIDS THAT ARE THAT ARE INTERESTING ON IN TERMS OF THEIR EFFECTS ON METABOLISM ET CETERA YOU CAN LOOK THOSE UP A BENEFITS OF BUTTER BUT AGAIN VOLUME IS IMPORTANENT YOU CAN'T OVERDO IT COSTELLO INSANLY LOVES BUTTER AS WELL ALONG THE LINES OF HORMONES AND TESTOSTRON GET A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS I THINK BECAUSE A LOT OF ON LINE COMMUNITIES ARE SORT OF OBSESSED WITH TESTOSTRON AND I JUST WONE TO EMPHASIZE THAT YES HAVING SUFFICIENT LEVELS OF TESTOSTRON IS VITALLY IMPORTANT FOR BRAIN FUNCTION AND HAVING SUFFICIENT LEVELS OF ESTROGEN WILLALLOW YOUR BRAIN TO ACTUALLY FUNCTION IT TURNS OUT THAT ESTROGEN IS ONE OF THE MAIN WAYS IN WHICH THE BRAIN MAINTAINS LONGEVITY AND MAINTAINS ITS ABILITY TO THINK SO WE SHOULD ALL BE SEEKING OPTIMAL TESTOSTRON LEVELS FOR OURSELVES BOTH TESTSTRON AND ESTROGEN AND MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DISCASTUP UNTIL NOW MORNING SUNLIGHT EXERCISE FASTING THOSE CAN SUPPORT TESTOSTRON AN ESTROGEN IN MEANINGFUL AND POSITIVE WAYS I GET A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT HORMONOPTIMIZATION WE DID AN ENTIRE MONTH ON THIS TOPIC WE DID ENTIRE EPISODE ON TESTOSTRON AND ESTROGEN OPTIMIZATION S ONE OF BRIEFLY HIGH LIGHT TWO THINGS THAT COULD BE RELEVANT AND THEN IF YOU WANT MORE DETAILS PLEASE GO SEE THAT EPISODE THE FIRST IS THAT TESTAOSTRON CAN EXERT ITS VARIOUS FUNCTIONS ONLY IN ITS UNBOUND FORM FREE TESTOSTRON WE ALL MAKE A PARTICULAR BINDING PROTING CALLED SEXHORMON BINING GLOBULANE THAT AS SENCTILLY BINDS UP TESTOSTRN PREVENTS IT FROM BE FREE THE SOUNDS LIKE A TERRIBLE THING BUT ACTUALLYS A GOOD THING BECAUSE IT ALLOWS TESTOSTRON BE TRANSPORTED TO THE VARIOUS TISSUES INCLUDING THE BRAIN WHERE CAN IT EXERT ITS VARIOUS FUNCTIONS FOR THOSE THAT HAVE LOWER THAN DESIRED LEVELS OF TESTOSTRON OR TOO MUCH SEXHORMON MININGLOBULANE IT TURNS OUT THAT FOUR HUNDRED MELIGRAMS PERDAY OF SOMETHING CALLED TONGOT ALI WHICH IS A FORM OF GINSANG CAN ACTUALLY HELP INCREASE LEVELS OF FREE TESTOSTRON MANY PEOPLE EXPERIENCE A POSITIVE SUBJECTIVE EFFACT AND SOME OBJECTIVE AFFECTS AS WELL MEANING INCREASES IN FREE TESTSTRON WHEN THEY DO BLOOD ANALSIS THEIR SOME DAYE ON THAT NOT A TON IN THE PUREVIEE LITERATURES AND AGAIN ALWAYS APPROACH THESE WITH A SENSE OF OF CAUTION AND DEPILING TACTOUR DOCTOR IF YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THAT YOU CAN GO TO EXAMINED OT CALM THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF ON INFORMATION THEIR LISTED ABOUT THAT THE OTHER COMPOUND THAT'S RELEVANT BOTH TO MEN AND WOMEN OR I SHOULD SAY PEOPLE THAT ARE TRYING TO OPTIMIZE TESTOSTRON END OR ESTROGEN IS FIDOGIA PIDOGIA AGRESTUS IS A AHIAN HERB THAT INCREASES THAT LEVELS OF WHAT' CALLED LUTINIZING HORMON LUTINIZING HORMON IS A HORMON THAT'S RELEASED FROM THE HYPOTHALMUS WITHIN THE BRAIN THAT TRAVELS TO THE GONADS EITHER THE OVERES ARE THE TESTIS TO STIMULATE THE RELEASE OF ESTROGEN OR TESTOSTRON AND PFIDOGIA AGRESTUS HAS BEEN SHOWN ALL BEIT AN A LIMITED NUMBER OF STUDIES TO INCREASE LEVELS OF LUTNIZING HORMON AND THEREBY LEVELS OF TESTOSTRON IN ESTROGEN AN WAYS THAT A SOME PEOPLE FIND BENEFICIAL SO JUST ONE TO MENTION THOSE TWO AND AGAIN IF YOU WANT A LOT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT HORMONOPTIMIZATION PLE SEE THE EPISODES ON HORMONOPTIMIZATION A KEY ASPECT TO THE MIDDAY MEAL IF YOU WANT THAT MEAL TO BENEFIT YOU IS TO TAKE A BRIEF WALK AFTERWARDS IT TURNS OUT THAT BRIEF WALKS OF FIVE TO THIRTY MINUTES AFTER INGESTING FOOD CAN ACCELERATE METABOLISM AND ACTUALLY CAN ACCELERATE AND IMPROVE NEUTRIEN UTILIZATION JUS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS METAPOLISM BUT NONE THE LESS THAT SOMETHING THAT I DO AFTER I FINISH MY NUN MEAL I DO FORCE MYSELF T O STAND UP AND GO OUTSIDE AND TAKE A BRIEF WALK THAT ALSO GETS MAY GET INTO OPTIC FLOW IT ALSO HAS ANOTHER BENEFIT WHICH IS THAT I AM GIVING MY BRAIN END THEREBY MY BODY MORE INFORMATION ABOUT LIGHT AND TIME A DAY WHICH IS ALWAYS BETTER THAN LESS INFORMATION ABOUT LIGHT AND TIME AF DAY MUCH OF OUR CIRCADIAN RHYTHM AND OUR HEALTH RHYTHMS AND ALL OF OUR COGNIVE RHYTHMS ET CETERA OR SUPPORTED BY OUR CELLS KNOWING WHERE THEY ARE IN TIME AND LIGHT IS THE PRIMARY ZIT GAPER THE THAT'S GERMAN FOR TIMEKEEPER IS THE PRIMARY WAY IN WHICH THE BODY LEARNS INFORMATION OR ABOUT WHAT FUNCTION SHOULD BE TURNED ON IN WHAT FUNCTION SHOULD BE TURNED OFF SO GETTING THAT MORNING LIGHT PULSE WITHIN ALSO LEAVING THE HOUSE OR APARTMENT OR WORK PLACE IN GETTING OUT FOR A FEW MINUTES AFTER LUNCH IS BENEFICIAL FOR METABOLISM BENEFICIAL FOR NEUTRIAN UTILIZATION END BENEFICIAL FOR ALL THE ORGANS AND TISSUES OF THE BODY BECAUSE YOUR GETTING THAT OUTSIDE LIGHT EXPOSURE NOW I LIKE TO SHIFT OUR ATTENTION TOWARD SCIENCE SUPPORTED PROTOCALLS THAT INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND OUR PERFORMANCE IN EVERYTHING AND BY EVERYTHING I MEAN SLEEP I MEAN PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE I MEAN MENTAL PERFORMANCE AN LESS ANXIETY ALL THE THINGS TRULY ALL THE THINGS AND THAT IS SOMETHING CALLED NON SLEEP DEEP REST NON SLEEP DEEP REST OR ENESTY ARE IS AN ACRONYM THAT I COIN AS AN UMBRELLA TERM TO INCOMPASS MANY PROTOCALLS THAT ALL HAVE BEEN SHOWN IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER TO SUPPORT BETTER BRAIN AND BODY FUNCTION OW THESE PROTOCALLS HAVE NAMES THAT YOU'V FEARD BEFORE THINGS LIKE MEDITATION THINGS LIKE YOGANEDRA AND THINGS LIKE HYPNOSIS ALL OF THESE PPROTOCALLS AND THESE ACTIVITIES HOWEVER SHARE SOMETHING IN COMMON WHICH IS THEY INVOLVE A DELIBERATE AND DIRECTED SHIFT IN ONE STATE AND THE SHIFT TENDS TO BE TOWARD A STATE OF DEEPER RELAXATION WE CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE TIME NOW TO DISSECT OUT THE LITERATURE ON ALL OF THESE THERE IS AMPLE LITERATURE I SHOULD SAY THERE IS ROBUST AND AMPLE LITERATURE SUPPORTING THE FACT THAT A REGULAR MEDITATION PRACTICE IS BENEFICIAL BUT MEDITATION ITSELF HAS MANY FORMS TRANSCIDENTIAL MEDITATION LOVING KINDNESS MEDITATION THIRDIE MEDITATION WALKING MEDITATION YOGONEDRA AS A PRACTICE I HAVE TALKED ABOUT MANY TIMES BEFORE WHICH INVOLVES SIMPLY LYING DOWN IT DOESN'T ALVE ANY MOVEMENT NO DOWN DOGS ARE UP DOGS OR ANYTHING IT DIS INVOLVES LYING ON YOUR BACK AND DOING SOME SPECIFIC LONG ECAL BREATHING THEIR LOT OF YOGANETER SCRIPTS OUT THERE THAT ARE QUITE GOOD BUT THERE'S ONE ANESTY ARE TIHT PROTOCALL THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN BY THE GREATEST NUMBER OF SCIENTIFIC STUDIES TO PROMOTE NOT JUST STATES OF DEEP RELAXATION NOCIOUS STATES OF HEIGHTEND FOCUS BUT ALSO TO ACCELERATE PLASTICITY IN LEARNING WITHIN THE BRAIN AND THAT'S HYPNOSIS AND I'VE BECOME INCREASINGLY EXCITED AND INTERESTED IN HYPNOSIS AS A TOOL AND NOT JUST A TOOL OF ANY KIND BUT A TOOL THAT REALLY CAN BE DIRECTED TOWARD PARTICULAR GOALS AND OUTCOMES AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY WHAT SETS HYPNOSIS A PART AS AN ANESTIAR NON SLEEP DEBREATH PROTOCAL FROM THINGS LIKE NAPS OR THINGS LIKE YOGANEDRA OR THINGS LIKE MEDITATION AND I CERTAINLY BELIEVE AND UNDERSTAND THE MEDITATION NAPS IN YOGANEDRIC CAN BE DIRECTED TOWARD LESS ANXIETY ET CETERA BUT HYPNOSIS IS UNIQUE IN THAT IT'S VERY DIRECTED THE ESSENCE OF HYPNOSIS IS FOR THE PERSON YOU TO GUIDE YOUR BRAIN TOWARD A PARTICULAR OUTCOME OR CHANGE SO I LIKE TO POINT OUT A PARTICULAR RESOURCE IS A COMPLETELY ZEROCOST RESOURCE WHICH IS REVERI DOC COM THAT'S R E VE E R I DOT COM REVERY DOT COM O VESEE IS A WEBSITE WHERE THERE ARE LINK TO AN AP THAT'S AVAILABLE IN APPLE AND ANDROID THIS IS A HYPNOSIS AP BUT THIS IS INTIOUS ANY HYPNOSIS APTHIS IS A HYPNOSIS AP THAT CONTAINS MULTIPLE HYPNOSIS PROTOCALLS THAT ARE ALL BACK BY VERY HIGH QUALITY SCIENCE THE SCIENCE WAS DONE BY MY COLLEAGUE IND OUR ASSOCIATEURE OF PSYCHIOTRY AT STAMPORD SCHOL OF MEDICINE THAT DAVIDS PEAGLE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT WORK I'M NOT ASSOCIATED WITH THAT SCIENTIFIC WORK THEY'VE EXAMINE WHAT BRAIN AREAS GET ACTIVATED DURING HYPNOSIS WHAT THE OUTCOMES ARE FOR VARIOUS HYPNOSIS PROTOCALS AND WITHIN REVERI YOU WILL FIND HYPNOSIS PROTOCALLS FOR ENHANCING YOUR PHOCUS IN HANCING CRATIVITY REDUCING PAIN GETTING BETTER T SLEEPING REDUCING ANXIETY MOST OF THESE ARE ABOUT TEN OR FIFTEEN MINUTES LONG SOME OF THEM ARE EXTREMELY BRIEF ONE MINUTE LONG THEY HAVE A ONE MINUTE HYPNOSIS THAT YOU CAN DO THOSE ONE MINUTE HYPNOSISCRIPTS WORK BEST IF YOU'VE BEEN DOING THE TEN AND FIFTEEN MINUTE ONES REGULARLY OR SEMI REGULARLY IT'S A REALLY WONDERFUL RESOURCE FOR WHICH THERE IS A LOT OF PURE REVIEWED PUBLISHED DATA ONE STUDY I LIKE TO EMPHASIZE IN PARTICULAR IS GANG ATAL J I A AN G THAT IS A REFERENCE YOU CAN FINE ON THE REVERY DOT COM WEBSITE UNDER OUR RESEARCH AND THE TITLE OF THIS PAPER IS BRAIN ACTIVITY AND FUNCTIONAL CONACTIVITY ASSOCIATE WITH HYPNOSIS AND IT AS PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL CEREBRAL CORTUX WHAT THIS PAPER ESSENTIALLY SHOWS IS THAT SPECIFIC ARIAS OF OUR BRAIN THAT INVOLVED IN EXECUTIVE FUNCTION WHICH IS ASSOCIATE WITH OUR ABILITY TO PHOCUS AS WELL AS WHAT'S CALLED THE DEFAULT MODE NETWORK WHICH IS SORT OF THE WAY THAT YOUR BRAIN IDOLS DOES YOUR BRAINTEN T IDOL AT AN IAT A LEVEL OF HIGH ANXIETY OR CALM AS WELL AS ACTIVATION OF A BRAIN AR CALLED THE INSULA THAT'S I AN S UALA THE INSOLAS EXTREMELY INTERESTING HYPNOSIS HAS BEEN SHOWN TO ACTIVATE THE INSOLA WHICH CAN ENHANCE OUR SENSE OF INTEROCEPTION OUR SENSE OF INTERNAL STATE WHICH MIGHT SOUND LIKE A ANNOYING THING YOU DON'T WANT OF BE THINKING ABOUT YOUR HEART BEAD OR YOUR BREATHING BUT WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING ABOUT HYPNOSIS IS THAT IT INCREASES ARIES THE BRAIN THE RESPONSIBLE FOR DEEP RELAXATION PHOCUS AND SELF AWARENESS THIS INTEROCEPTION SIMULTANEOUSLY AND TH TS VERY UNUSUAL COMPARED TO OTHER STATES ANY OTHER STATES OF ANY TIME SO I'VE MADE IT A PRACTISE A DAILY PRACTISE IN FACT THAT AFTER LUNCH AN AFTER THIS WALK I DO A BRIEF TEN MINUTE HYPNOSIS SCRIPT BECAUSE OF WHAT I FOUND IS THAT IN CONTRAST TO NAPS AND IN CONTRAST TO OTHER FORMS OF ENISTY ARE IT REALLY ALLOWS ME TO ENTER A STATE OF DEEP RELAXATION BUT ALSO TO THEN EXIT THAT STATE IN A VERY FOCUS AND DELIBERATE WAY THAT ALLOWS ME TO LEAN INTO MY AFTERNOON IN AN ALERT WAY IN A WAY THAT I CAN FUNCTION AND DO MENTAL WORK AND INTERACT WITH PEOPLE ET CETERA SO THERE'S NO BRAIN FOG THERE'S NO GROGGINESS AND I WANT EMPHASIZE THAT THE HYPNOSIS THAT I'M REFERRING TO HERE AND THAT REVERI PROVIDES IS NOT STAGE HYPNOSISIS ISN'T YOU BEING PROGRAMM TO SQUALK LIKE A CHICKEN OR DO ANYTHING AGAINST YOUR WILL THIS IS YOU TEACHING YOUR BRAIN HOW TO ACCESS THESE FOCUS RELAXED IN TERROCEPTIVE STATES THIS IS ALSO AN EXTREMELY VALUABLE ASPECT TO HYPNOSIS BECAUSE IT CAN INCREASE PLASTICITY THE BRAINS ABILITY TO CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO EXPERIENCE IT'S ESSENTIALLY OPENING UP PATHWAYS THAT ALLOW YOU TO CHANGE YOUR BRAIN IN THE WAYS THAT YOU WANT AND IT'S VERY DIRECTED TOWARD PARTICULAR OUTCOMES SO I AM AN AS YOU CAN PROBABLY TELL I AM VERY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT HYPNOSIS AS AN OPTIMAL AND ASTHE ARE PROTOCOL AND SO I DO THAT EVERY SINGLE DAY THERE ARE DAYS THAT I DON'T MANAGE TO DO IT FOR WHATEVER REASON I FORGET OR A INTERFERENCE FOR MEMALE OR ET CETERA BUT THAT IS ESSENTIALLY HOW I ENTER MY EARLY AFTERNOON I DO THIS POST LUNCH POST WALK AND ESTY ARE IN THE FORM OF A REVERY HYPNOSIS AGAIN A COMPLETELY A ZERO COST RESOURCE TO YOU THEIR EXCELLENT DATA AALL THOSE DATA A CAN BE FOUND ON THE REVERY SITE AND YOU ALSO LEARN A LOT MORE ABOUT HYPNOSIS AND WHAT SORTS OF HYPNOSIS PROTOCALS MIGHT BE OPTIMAL FOR YOU SO FEW ARE LOOKING FOR A SCIENCE BACK O ZERO COST VERY EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR GETTING BETTER AT FOCUSING BETTER AT SLEEPING BETTER AT ALL THE THINGS THAT I BELIEVE PEOPLE WANT I DO BELIEVE THAT IS THE THE BEST TOOL THAT ONE CAN ACCES AT THIS POINT TIME SO THEN AFTER I EXHYPNOSIS USUALLY GIVE COSTILLILL SCRATCH BEHIND THE EAR AND THEN I  MAKE SURE THAT I HYDRATE HYDRATIAN AGAIN IS VITALLY IMPORTANT FOR BRAIN FUNCTION A IT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT FOR ALL BODILY FUNCTIONS AND I OFTEN FORGET TO DO IT SO I'VE JUST SORT OF LINKED THE DRINKING OF WATER A TO MY HYPNOSIS PRACTISE AS SOON AS I'M DONE I HYDRATE AND THEN I TEND TO FOCUS ON ANOTHER WORK ABOUT SO THIS WOULD BE FOR ME SOME TIME AROUND TWO THIRTY OR THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN NORMALLY I WOULD BE QUITE SLEEPY AND PASSING OUT HOWEVER THE PROTOCOL OF SHIFTING MY MORNING CAFIN TO NINETY MINUTES TWO HOURS AFTER WAKING AS WELL AS THE USE OF THIS HYPNOSIS PROTOCOL HAS REALLY ALLOWED ME TO MOVE THROUGH THE AFTERNOON IN A WAY THAT I DON'T EXPERIENCE THAT DIP IN ENERGY EVER INCE A WHILE I FEELKON ASLEEPY OR KIND OF OUT OF IT BUT I'VE BEEN A REALLY PLEASANTLY SURPRISED AT THE EXTENT TO WHICH ONE CAN AVOID THAT AFTERNOON DIP IF YOU DO CERTAIN THINGS PROPERLY PRIOR TO THE ARRIVAL OF TWO OR THREE P M NOW IF YOU'RE A NAPPER AND YOU AN A NAP NO BIG DEAL A NAPS CAN BE WONDERFULLY BENEFICIAL HERE ARE THE RULES ARE OUND NAPPING ACCORDING TO THE SLEEP SCIENCE STAMFORD HAS AN EXCELLENT SLEEP CLINEC I CONSULTED WITH JAMESIGHTSIR A MY COLLEAGUE IN THE A STANFORD SLEEP LABORATORY AS WELL AS A NAP WALKER OUT AT BERKLEY WHOSE NAME I AM SURE MOST OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH WROTE THIS WONDERFUL BOOK WHY WE SLEEP NAPS SHOULD BE NINETY MINUTES OR LESS AND TWENTY MENUTE NAPS ARE FINE BUT NOT LONGER THAN NINETY MINUTES AND THERE ESSENTIALLY TWO VARIETIES OF PEOPLE PEOPLE FOR WHOM NAPPING INTERFERES WITH FALLING ASLEEP LATER THAT NIGHT AND STAYING ASLEEP AND PEOPLE FOR WHOM THE NAP DOES NOT INTERFERE YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WHO YOU ARE AND IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO CAN NAP AND NOT HAVE ANY TROUBLE FALLING OSLEEP AND STAYING ASLEEP LATER THAT NIGHT WELL BY ALL MEANS NAP JUST MAKE IT NINETY MINUTES OR LAST AGAIN THESE NINETY MINUTES CYCLES ARE REALLY A VITAL CONSTRAINT THAT WE SHOULD ALL OBEY IF IT'S NINETY ONE MINUTES DON'T WORRY YOU WON'T DISSOLVE INTO A PUDDLE OF TEARS BUT IF YOUR STARTYING TO SLEEP FOR AN HOUR OR MORE IN THE AFTERNOON THAT CAN BE PROBLEMATIC IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO CAN NAP FOR TEN TWENTY MINUTES THAT'S PROBABLY BETTER THAN GETTING A FULL NINEY MINUTES CYCL UNLESS YOU DIDN'T GET ENOUGH SLEEP THE NIGHT BEFORE BUT YOU REALLY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S RIGHT FOR YOU THERE'S A LOT OF VARIETY THERE BUT THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT THE SCIENCE SAYS NOW WHETHER R NOT YOU NAP OR WHETHER NOT YOU DO NOT NAP A KEY PROTOCALL FOR SLEEP HEALTH AND WAKEFULNESS AND METABOLISM AND HORMON HEALTH IS VIEWING LIGHT IN THE AFTERNOON SO HERE'S THE REASON FOR DOING THIS AS WE PROGRESS INTO THE EVENING HOURS THERE'S A PHENOMENON WEARE OUR RET NA OUR EYES BECOME VERY SENSITIVE TO LIGHT SUCH THAT IF WE VIEW BRIGHT LIGHTS OR EVEN NOT SO BRIGHT LIGHTS BETWEEN THE HOURS OF TEN P M AND FOUR A M THAT IS STRONGLY DESRUPTIVE VERY DESRUPTIVE FOR OUR DOPOMINE PRODUCTION IT CAN REALLY SCRUP OUR SLEEP AND IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN SHOWN IN DATA FROM DAVID BERSON'S LAB AT BROWN UNIVERSITY ONE THE FOREMOST CIRCANIAN BIOLOGY LABORATORIES AS WELL AS SEMM OR TARS LABORATORY AT THE NATIUNAL INSTITUTES A MENTAL HEALTH THAT VIEWING BRIGHT LIGHT OR EVEN NOT SO BRIGHT LIGHT BETWEEN THESE HOURS OF ELEVEN P M AND FOUR A M OR EVEN TEN P M AN FOR A M CAN DESTRUPT LEARNING IN MEMORY CAN DESTRUPT THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND CAN DESTRUPT MOOD IN VERY LONG LASTING WAYS THERE ARE WAYS TO OFFSET THAT HOWEVER WHAT I CALL YOUR NET FLICS IN OCULATION THOSE OF YOU THAT LIKE TO STAY UP LATE ON THE TABLET OR COMPUTER OR WATCHING NAP FLICTS GETTING A LITTLE BIT OF AFTERNOON LIGHT IN YOUR EYES SOMEWHAT COUNTER INTUITIVELY CAN PREVENT THIS DESRUPTION OF BRIGHT LIGHT LATER IN THE EVENING AT LEAST SOMEH T WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT WELL IF YOU VIEW LIGHT AS THE SUN IS STARTING TO GO DOWN IF YOU STEP OUTSIDE AROUND FOUR P M FIVE P M AGAIN WHAT TIME EXACTLY WILL DEPEND ON TIME OF YEAR AND WHERE YOU ARE LOCATED ON OUR PLANET BUT AS THE SUN STARTS TO HEAD DOWN YOU DON'T NECESSARILY AFE TO SEE THE SUNSET AND BE LOVELY IF YOU COULD SUN SETS ARE BEAUTIFUL BUT IF YOU CAN GET OUTSIDE AND SEE THE SUN IS IT ARCS DOWN OR IF YOU CAN'T SEE THE SUN DIRECTLY GET SOME SUNLIGHT IN YOUR EYES IN THE AFTERNOON HOURS O MAY BE FOUR P M ISH AND DO THAT FOR TWENTY THIRTY MINUTES MAY BE READING OUTSIDE OR TAKING A WALK I WALK THE DOG AGAIN THAT'S MY PROTOCALL IN ORDER TO GET THAT EVENING LIGHT WHAT IT DOES IS IT LOWER THE SENSITIVITY OF YOUR RETINA IN THE LATE EVENING HOURS WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO BUFFER YOURSELF AGAINST THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF BRIGHT LIGHT LATER AT NIGHT NOW IT WON'T ALLOW YOU TO BLAST YOUR EYES WITH BRIGHT LIGHT YOU STILL NEED TO DIM THE LIGHTS IN THE EVENING BUT THERE'S A VERY NICE STUDY THAT WAS PUBLISH IN SCIENTIFIC REPORTS THAT ILLUSTRATES THAT IF ONE DOES THIS IF YOU GO OUTSIDE AND VIEW SUNLIGHT IN THE EVENING HOURS FOR ANYWHERE FROM FIVE TO THIRTY MINUTES AND I REALIZE THAT PEOPLE HAVE A RANGE OF OF CONSTRAINTS ON THEIR SCHEDULE BUT FROM FIVE TO THIRTY MINUTES WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT YOUR MELOTONEAN RHYTHM STAYS APPROPRIATE NOW WE HAVEN'T TALK TOO MUCH ABOUT MELOTONEAND BUT MELOTONAN IS A HORMONE THAT IS INHIBITED BY LIGHT IT'S ACTUALLY PREVENTED BY LIGHT AND MELATONEN IS THE HORMONE TAT ALLOWS YOU TO FALL ASLEEP EASILY NOW I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT SUPPLEMENTING MELATONE AND I'M TALKING ABOUT MELATONIN THAT YOU NATURALLY PRODUCE FROM YOUR PINEL SO THE PROTOCOL IS VERY SIMPLE GET OUTSIDE IN THE AFTERNOON OR EVENING FOR TEN TO THIRTY MINUTES TAKE YOUR SUN GLASSES OFF GET SOME BRIGHT LIGHT GET SOME NATURAL LIGHT IN YOUR EYES IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT PROBABLY BETTER TO JUST STAY WITH STANDARD ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS INSIDE DON'T CRANK THEM UP BUT JUST START TO DIM THEM AGAIN THIS WOULD BE A TIME TO AVOID BLUE BLOCKERS PEOPLE ARE POPPING ON BLUE BLOCKERS AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON CAUSE YOUR WORRIED THAT BLUE LIGHT IS GOIN TO INSTRRUPT YOUR SLEEP WELL YOUARE MAKING YOUR EYES MORE SENSITIVE TO ANY LIGHT THAT YOU MIGHT SEE LATER IN THE EVENING BLUE LIGHT OR OTHERWISE SO GET THAT AFTERNOON LIGHT SO WHAT YOU'LL PROBABLY NOTICE IS THAT THE OPTIMAL PROTOCALLS FOR OPTIMIZING YOUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE AND SLEEP ET CETERA ARE ACTUALLY REALLY SIMPLE BUT JUST BECAUSE THEIR SIMPLE DOES NOT MEAN THAT THEY ARE NOT POWERFUL IN FACT THEY ARE VERY POWERFUL BECAUSE THEY LEVERAGE THE MOST POWERFUL TECHNOLOGY THAT EXISTS WHICH IS YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM NOW WE ALWAYS THINK ABOUT TECNOLOGIES AS DEVICES AND INDEED THEREARE SOME WONDERFUL DEVICES OUT THERE SOME PEOPLE ARE REALLY INTO TRACTING THEIR SLEEP AND THEIR SLEEP TIME FEARE INTO THAT GRATE THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT I PERSONALLY DO ALTHOUGH I KEEP TELLING MYSELF THAT I I SHOULD DO THAT THERE ARE DEVICES THAT CAN CONTROL BRAINWAVES AND THINGS OF THAT SORT BUT WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TO DAY ARE REALLY BASIC THINGS THAT WE CAN ALL DO THAT CAN STEER OUR NEROLOGY AND OAURE BIOLOGY IN THE DIRECTIONS THAT ARE GOING TO SUPPORT WORK FLO THAT ARE GOING TO SPORT HORMONS THAT ARE GOING TO SUPPORT BRAIN FUNCTION SO THIS AFTERNOON LIGHT VIEWING IS YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF LEVERGING A TECHNOLOGY THAT YOU WERE BORN WITH AND THAT YOU WILL DIE WITH AND THA YOU WILL HAVE EVERY DAY IN BETWEEN IN ORDER TO TWEAK THE HORMONS OF YOUR SYSTEM IN THIS CASE THE HORMON MELATONAN SO THAT ITS RELEASED AT THE APPROPRIATE TIMES AND NOT AT THE WRONG TIMES BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WHEN HORMONS AND SYSTEMS OF THE BODY ARE WELL ALINED WITH THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS SCHEDUAL BEAUTIFUL THINGS HAPPEN AND WHEN THEY ARE MISSILINED TERRIBLE THINGS HAPPEN SOMETIMES THOSE TERRIBLE THINGS ARE SUBTLE AT FIRST BUT DESTRUPTING YOUR CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS IS REALLY BAD FOR EVERY SYSTEM IN YOUR BODY GETTING IT RIGHT AND AS YOU CAN TELL GETTING T RIGHT DOESN'T TAKE MUTH CAN REALLY SERVE TO QUOTINQUO OPTIMIZE YOU AND I SAY OPTIMIZE IT ME PUTS YOU INTO A BETTER MOOD OVER ALL BETTER STATE FOR LEARNING ET CETERA SO GET THAT AFTERNOONLIGHT AS WELL SO AT SOME POINT IN THE EVENING I EAT THAT THING THAT WE CALL DINNER AND WHILE IT FEEL SORT OF STRANGE TO TALK ABOUT MY DINNER THE REASON I WANT TO TALK ABOUT MY DINNER AND WHAT I EAT FOR DINNER IS THAT FOR ME DINNER OF COURSE IS ABOUT EATING I WILL MENTION AGAIN I LOVE EATING BUT ALSO ABOUT OPTIMIZING THE TRANSITION TO SLEEP AND SLEEP SO OBVIOUSLY I EAT FOODS THAT I ENJOY I AM NOT ONE OF THESE PEOPLE THAT WILL EAT ANYTHING OR AVOID EATING ANYTHING SIMPLY TO A BENEFIT A FROM THAT I DO ENJOY FOOD VERY VERY MUCH AND SO MY DINNER GENERALLY IS COMPRISED OF THINGS THAT ARE GOING TOSUPPORT REST AND DEEP SLEEP AND THAT MEANS STARCHI CARBOHYDRATES IT'S ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT ONE OF THE MAJOR WAYS THAT WE CAN INCREASE CERATONAN WHICH HELPS IN THE TRANSITION TO SLEEP IS BY INGESTING STARCHI CARBOHYDRATES NOW I REALIZE THAT STARCHI CARBOHYDRATES OUR KIND OF A DEMONIZED TERM NOWADAYS NEVERONS ANTI CARBS BUT YOU KNOW WE REALLY SHOULD DISTINGUISH BETWEEN REFINE SUGARS AND COMPLEX CARBOHYDRATES AND WE DID AN EPISODE ABOUT THIS WE TALKED ABOUT HOW REFINE SUGARS DISRUPT NOT JUST METABOLISM BUT THEY ACTUALLY DISRUPT SOME OF THE NURONS IN THE GUT THAT SENSE FATIACIDS AND MENOACIDS FROM FATS AND PROTINES BUT THOSE SAME NURONS CAN ACTUALLY RESPOND TO SUGAR AND CREATE A SITUATION WHERE YOU ACTUALLY START CRAVING MORE SUGAR BECAUSE THOSE NURONS IN YOUR GUT COMMUNICATE VIA NERVE PATHWAY FOR YOUR PHYSINATOS I CALL THE VAGUS NERVE A AND ALLOW CLUSTER OF NURONS CALLE THE NODOSE GANGLIA AND O D O SI ANODES GANGLEAS OR RITE NEXT TO YEAR OF THE CORNER OF YOUR JAW AND CONTRIGAR THE ACTIVATION IN THE RELEASE OF DOPAMING YOUR BRAIN WHICH BASICLLY MAKES YOU CRAVE MORE SUGAR INDEPENDENT OF HOW SOMETHING TASTES SO WHEN I SEE CARBOHYDRATES WHAT I REALLY MEAN AS A STARCHI CARBOHYDRATES A NON REFINE SUGARS AND IN THE EPISODE ABAU T FOOD AND MOOD AND METABOLISM AS WELL I REFERENCE TO REALLY SPECTACULAR LECTURE BY DOCTOR ROBERT LUSTIC WHOSE A PEDIATRIC ANER CHONOLOGIST THAT YOU CSEIACAF U SEE SAND FRANCISCO ABSOLY A SPECTACULAR TALK YOU CAN FIND IT ON OU TOOB EASILY WHERE HE TALKS ABOUT THE SCIENCE OF REFINE SUGARS AND THIS IS N'T IN ANY KIND OF CONSPIRACY OR PARENOID WAY THIS IS REALLY THE MEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE SO MY DINNER IS CARBOHYDRATES AND SOME PROTINE SO MAY BE SOME CHICKEN ORFICH OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT MAY BE SOME EGGS ER SOMETIMES JUST POSTO OR JUST RICE AND VEGETABLES AND THAT'S BECAUSE I ENJOY THOSE FOODS BUT ALSO BECAUSE I WANT TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF CERATONAN IN MY BRAIN SO THAT I CAN ACTALY FALL SLEEP THAT NIGHT MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE ON LOWCARBOHYDRATE DIETES STRUGGLE WITH FALLING AND STAYING ASLEEP AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO ACHIEVE HEIGHTEN LEVELS OF CERATONAN WHICH ARE NECESSARY TO ENTER SLEEP I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THAT MALATONAN AND CERATONAN FALL IN THE SAME PATHWAY THEY ARE RELATED A HORMONE'S AND NEUROMODULATORS W WON'T GO INTO THEIR BIOSYNTHESIS NOW BUT SINCILY WHAT RETALKING ABOUT IS A SYSTEM THAT'S BIACING US TOWARDS REST IN RELAXATION AS OPPOSE TO WAKEFULNESS YOU MIGHT ASK WELL CANT I JUST TAKE CERATONAN CAN'T I JUST TAKE FIVE AH TEPE OR A PRECURSER TO CERETONAN OR TRIPTOPHAN AND INDEED YOU CAN HOWEVER MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF FIND THAT WHEN THEY SUPPLEMENT WITH CERATONAN IN THE EVENING OR AT NIGHT THAT CAN CAUSE PROBLEMS IN THE ARCHITECTURE OR THE STRUCTURE OF SLEEP CAN CAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE INCLUDING ME TO FALL ASLEEP VERY FAST SLEEP VERY DEEPLY FOR THREE OR FOUR HOURS AND THEN WAKE UP AND HAVE A TERRIBLE TIME FALLING BACK ASLEEP AND THAT EFFECT AT LEAST FOR ME AS A CAN LAST SEVERAL DAYS ITS REALLY DESTRUPTIVE SO I DON'T LIKE TO SUPPLEMENT WITH ANYTHING THAT IS DIRECTLY DOPOMINE OR A PRECURS ARE TO DOPOMINE AT ANY TIME OR DIRECTLY CERATONAN OR A PRECURSOR TO CERETONAN RATHER THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT CAN ENHANCE THE TRANSITION TO SLEEP SAFELY WHICH WE WILL TALK ABOUT IN A FEW MINUTES BUT THE EVENING MEAL CONSISTS LARGELY OF CARBOHYDRATES FOR THAT SPECIFIC PURPOSE OF GENERATING A SENSE OF CALM AND OF COURSE CARBYDRATES ARE DELICIOUS AND BECAUSE I AM DOING PHYSICAL TRAINING AND PRESUMABLY YOU ARE AS WELL I HOPE YOU ARE CAUSE IT SO BENEFICIAL TO ONE'S HEALTH THAT'S ALSO GOING TO REPLENISH MY LICAGEN STORES WHICH IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY FUEL SOURCES FOR MOVING ONE'S MUSCLES AND MOVING ROUND AND DOING EXERCISE AS WELL AS FOR THE BRAIN AND FOR COGNAVE FUNCTION SO LOW CARBOHYDRATES A THROUGHOUT THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR PERIOD ARE NOT SOMETHING THAT ARE ATTRACTIVE TO ME I REALIZE TAT SOME PEOPLE WILL DO MUCH BETTER ON A LOW CARBOHYDRATE OR EVEN QETOGENIC DIET BUT A FOR ME AND I DO BELIEVE FOR MOST PEOPLE CREATING A SITUATION OF MAY BE FASTING AND THEN LOW CARB OR NO CARB DIETS FOR STATES OF ALERTNESS AND FOCUS AT ONE PORTION OF THE DAY AND THEN INJESTING STARCHIC CARBOHYDRATES FORSAKE OF INDU CING REST AN RELAXATION IS A AT LEAST SCIENTIFICLY RATIONALLY BASED PRODOCAL IT'S GROUNDED IN REAL NARROW CHEMISTRY IT'S GROUNDED IN THINGS THAT WE CAN POINT TO AND SAY AH THIS FOOD SUBSTANCE THIS THING CAN SUPPORT MY BRAIN NOT DIRECTLY BECAUSE IT SOME MAGIC SUBSTANCE THAT CAN MAKE ALL MY NURANS AH YOU KNOW EXTREMELY ROBUST BUT RATHER IT'S GOING TO SUPPORT SLEEP WHICH IS PERHAPS THE FOUNDATION OF ALL MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH IN FACT WE CAN POINT TO SLEEP AS THE PRIMARY WAY IN WHICH WE CAN INSURE OUR OVER ALL HEALTH INCLUDING OUR BRAIN HEALTH SO LET'S TALK ABOUT SLEEP AND HOW TO ACCESS SLEEP HOW TO FALL ASLEEP EASILY AND HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SLEEP WE HAVE IS OF SUFFICIENT DURATION AND QUALITY ONE WAY TO DO THAT IS TO LEVERAGE THE DROP IN TEMPERATURE THAT'S NECESSARY TO FALL AND STAY ASLEEP  THEY MENTION EARLIER IN THE EARLY PARTS OF THE DAY AFTER WAKING OUR BODY TEMPERATURE IS RISING AND THAT CONTINUES THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND THEN SOME TIME LATE IN THE AFTERNOON OUR TEMPERATURE PEAPS AND THEN IT STARTS TO DROP THAT DROP IN TEMPERATURE OF ONE TO THREE DEGREES IS VITALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO FALL ASLEEP EASILY ONE WAY THAT WE CAN DECREASE OUR TRANSITION TIME INTO SLEEP IS TO ACCELERATE THAT DROP IN TEMPERATURE AN ONE WAY TO ACCELERATE THAT DROP IN TEMPERATURE SOMEWHAT COUNTER INTUITIVELY IS TO USE HOT BATHS HOT SHOWERS OR IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO ONE ASANA NOW THIS IS COUNTER INTUITIVE BECAUSE YOU'D SAY WHELL HOT BATHS OF ITS CAN A HEAT ME OUT BUT ACTUALLY IF YOU ARE TO GET INTO A SANA OR HOT SHOWER HOT BATH AND THEN GET OUT YOUR BODY IS GOING TO ENGAGE PARTICULAR MECHANISMS FOR COOLING ITSELF OFF THET ARE GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO DROP YOUR TEMPERATURE MORE QUICKLY AND FALL ASLEEP MORE EASILY THIS IS WHY MANY PEOPLE FIND THAT FALLING ASLEEP AFTER A NICE HOT SHOWER BATH OR SANA IS REALLY REALLY EASY AND REALLY TERRIFIC IT SORT OF A NATURAL STATE THAT FOLLOWS HOT BATHSANAS AND SHOWERS SO HOW WOULD YOU DO THIS WELL WE DID AN ENTIRE EPISODE ON THIS TOPIC IS WELL THE USE OF SANA FOR SAKE OF GROWTHORMON RELEASE IF YOU WAN AT CHECK THAT OUT IN ALL THE DETAILS YOU CAN LOOK AT THE EPISODE ON GROWTHORMON YOU WILL EXPERIENCE A GROWTHORMON RELEASE FROM SANA HOT BATH AND HOT SHOWER PROVIDED THEY ARE DONE FOR SUFFICIENT DURATION AND SUFFICIENTLY HIGH TEMPERATURE FOR ALL THE DETAILS OF THAT PLEASE GO TO THAT EPISODE IT'S ALL LAID OUT THERE IT'S ALL TIME STAMPD ITS ALL CAPTION IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH ET CETERA BUT BASICALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS TWENTY MINUTES IN THE SANA OR IF YOUR ONE OF THOSE FOLKS WHOSE REALLY CHASING GROWTHORMON RELEASE YOU CUL DO TWENTY MINUTES THEN GET OUT OF THE SANA FOR TEN MINUTES AND JUST COOL OFF AT ROIM TEMPERATURE AND THEY GET BACK INTO THE SANA THEN GET OUT AND THEN SHOWER OR DRY OFTEN AND  HED TO BED SHORTER ABOUTS OSANA WILL WORK ALSO THE LONGER BOUTS OF SANA COOLING SANA COOLING HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO LEAD TO HUGE INCREASES IN GROWTHORMON AND GROWTHORMONO COURSE IS INVOLVED BOTH IN MUSCLE GROWTH BUT ALSO GROWTH IN METABOLISM OF VALL TISSUES FATMATABOLISM AND REPAIR VERY IOUS TISSUE SO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT GROWTH YOU HEAR GROWTHHORM WHEN YOU THINK HYPERTROPHE BUT THE ENHANCEMENT OF METABOLISM AND HEALTH IN REPAIRIN A NUMBER OF TISSUES SO THAT'S ONE WAY YOU CAN LEVERAGE HEAT TORD THE TRANSITION TO SLEEP BY THE WAYS IN WHICH EXPOSURE TO HEAT ACTUALLY COOLS OFF YOUR BODY NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT ACTUALLY GETTING TO SLEEP ND LET'S TALK ABOUT BEHAVIOURAL PROTOCALS FIRST IT IS ABSOLULY TRUE THAT KEEPING THE ROOM VERY DARK IS BENEFICIAL SOME PEOPLE AND CLA MYSELF HAVE THIN EYELIDS AND IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH LIGHT TO WAKE UP THE BRAIN AND BODY SO KEEPING A ROOM VERY DARK IS ESSENTIAL THE OTHER THING IS KEEPING THE ROOM COOL YOUVE PROBABLY HEARD THIS BEFORE KEEP THE ROOM COOL GET UNDER WARM BLANKETS BUT RARELY IS IT DISCUSSD WHY KEEPING THE ROOM COOL IS USEFUL THE REASON KEEPING THE ROOM COOL IS USEFUL FOR GETTING INTO AND STAYING ASLEEP IS THAT THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT THERE ARE PHASES OF SLEEP WHERE YOU ARE PARALYZE SO CALLED REMSLEEP THAT'S A HEALTHY PARALYSIS OPRESUME WIS YOU CAN'T ACT OUT YOUR DREAMS BUT THERE ARE PORTIONS OF THE NIGHT WHERE YOU CAN MOVE AND ONE OF THE MORE IMPORTANT MOVEMENTS THAT YOU DO IN THE MIDDLE F THE NIGHT IS PUT YOUR HAND OUT OR YOUR FOOT OUT OR YOU TAKE YOUR FACE OUT FROM UNDER THE COVERS AS A MEANS TO COOL YOURSELF AND YOU DO THIS WHILE YOU ARE ASLEEP IF YOU ARE IN A COOL ROOM YOU CAN PUT YOURSELF UNDER THE BLANKETS TO STAY WARM AND THEN IF YOU WANT TO COOL OFF YOU CAN SIMPLY REMOVE A LIMB OR YOU CAN TOSS THE COVERS OFF ENTIRELY HOWEVER IF YOU ARE IN A ROOM THAT'S TOO WARM IT'S VERY HARD TO COOL OFF YOU WOULD NEED A BUCKET OF ICE WATER OR TO GET UP AND TURN ON THE AIR CONDITIONING OR SOMETHING N THAT SORT OR TURN ON THE FAN SO IT'S A SIMPLE BUT NON TRIVIAL WAY AND WHICH WE CAN IMPROVE OUR ENTRANCE TO SLEEP AND STAYING ASLEEP SO KEEP THE ROOM COOL OR COLD AND GET UNDER WARM BLANKETS AND IF YOU ON'T UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT WHY PUTTING A HAND OUT OR A FOOT OUT IS VALUABLE FOR COOLING I DID AN EPISODE ON THE ROLL OF COOLING IN SOMETHING CALLED HEAT DUMPING OR BRINGING HEAT INTO THE BODY THROUGH THE PALMS THE FACE IN THE BOTTOMS OF THE FEET YOU EAVE GOT THESE PORDALS THESE AM RADIATORS IF YOU WILL THAT ALLOW US TO BRING HEAT INTO THE BODY AND TO DUMP HEAT I DO ONT Y GO INTO THE DETAILS NOW BO THAT EPISODE IS ENTITLED SUPERCHARGE YOUR EXERCISE WITH COLD IS BASED ON WORK THAT WAS DONE BY CRAK HELLER'S LAB AT STAMFORD UNIVERSITY ABSOLUTELY IN CREDIBLE DATA SHOWING THAT THE PROPER USE OF PALMER COOLING SO THE PALMS OR THE UPPER HALF OF THE FACE OR THE BOTMS OF THE FEET CAN VASTLY I MAY VASTLY INCREASE THE VOLUME OF OF EXERCISE THAT ONE CAN DO AND STILL RECOVER FROM THET EXERCISE AND DERIVE BENEFITS FROM IT BUT THIS METHOD OF COOLING FOR EXERCISE S GROUNDED IN A BASIC PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF OUR PALMS THE BOLMS OF OUR FEET AND OUR FACE WHICH IS TO DUMP HEAT OR TO ALLOW COOL TO PASS INTO THE BODY SO THAT'S WHY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AS LONG AS YOU'RE NOT IN REM SLEEP IF YOU GET TOO WARM YOU PUT YOUR FOOT OUT OR YOU PUT YOUR ARMS OUT YOURE ACTUALLY ALLOWING COOLING OF THE BODY THROUGH WHAT ARE CALLED AVAS AR TERIO VENOUS ASTEMOSESES THE TECHNICAL NAME THAT ARE IN THE PALMS THE UPPER HALF OF THE FACE IN THE BOMBS OF THE FEEP AND THAT'S A VERY EFFICIENT WAY TO COOL OFF YOUR BODY SO YOU DO THAT SUBCONSCIOU SLEEP NOW THERE ARE THINGS THAT ONE CAN TAKE TO ENHANCE THE TRANSITION TO SLEEP I AM NOT A FIN OF MELATONAN FOR ENHANCING THE TRANSITION TO SLEEP FOR COUPLEREASONS ONE DOSAGES OF MELATONAN ARE FAR TOO HIGH AND MOST SUPPLEMENTS MELATONAN CAN HAVE SOME NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE SEXSTORID HARMONS TESTASTERON AN ESTEROGEN THAT'S A SERIOUS CONCERN THIRD MELATONANS ROLL DURING PUBRITY OR ROUND PURITY IS TO SUPPRESS THE ONSET OF PUBRITY SO THAT'S CONCERNING I DON'T KNOW THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE TAKING THIS HARMONHAT HAS ALL THESE OTHER EFFECTS THE OTHER REASON IS THAT MELATONE WILL AID THE TRANSITION TO SLEEP BUT IT WON'T KEEP YOU ASLEEP IN MANY PEOPLE THAT TAKE MELATONE AND FIND THAT THEY FALL ASLEE MORE QUICKLEEP BUT THEN THEY WAKE UP UNABLE TO FALL BACK OSLEEP THREE COMPOUNDS THAT COUN BE VERY BENEFICIAL FOR AIDING THE TRANSITION TO SLEEP AND FOR WHICH THERE ARE WIDE SAFETY MARGINS ALTHOUGH PLEASED DOU CHECK WITH YOUR PHYSICION BEFORE TAKING ANYTHING AR SPECIFIC FORMS OF MAGNESIUM SOMETHING CALLED APIGENIN AND THEANINE MAGNESIUM COMES IN MANY FORMS MAGNESIUM MALATE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE RECOVERY FROM SOR MUSCLES FOR INSTANCE MAGNESIUM CITRATE IS AN EXCELLENT LAXITIVE FOR INSTANCE MAGNESIUM THREE INATE THAT T H R EO AND AT THREE INATE AND MAGNESIUM BY GLICENATE HAVE TRANSPORTERS THAT ALLOW THEM TO CROSS THE BLOOD RAIN BARRIER MORE READILY THAN OTHER FORMS OF MAGNESIUM AND THERE WITHIN THE BRAIN THEY PROMOTE THE RELEASE OF A NOR TRANSMITTER CALLED GABO WHICH IS AN INHIBATORY NER TRANSMITTER WHICH SHUTS OFF THE FOREBRAIN TO SOME EXTENT DOESN'T SHUT OFF COMPLETELY BUT IT ESSENTIALLY SHUTS DOWN THINKING RUMINATION PLANNING AND AN WHAT WE CALL EXECUTIVE FUNCTION SO FOR MANY PEOPLE TAKING THREE HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED MELIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM BY GLICENATE OR MAGNESIUM THREE INATE AND THERE ON REFERRING TO THE ELEMENTAL MAGNESIUM FOR YOU A FASIONATOS MANY PEOPLE FIND THAT DOING THAT THIRTY TO SIXTY MINUTES BEFORE SLEEP CAN AID THEM IN FALLING SLEEP CAN REALLY HELP THEM FALL ASLEEP FASTER AN STAY ASLEEP SOME PEOPLE HOWEVER ACHIEVE SOME A GASTERONTESTINAL DISCOMFORT FROM MAGNESIUM AND THEREFORE SHOULD AVOID IT MAGNESIUM THREE NATN AND MAGNESIUM BY GLICENATE FOR MANY PEOPLE WORK HOWEVER AND WHEN COUPLED WITH APIGENIN AND THEANINE PROVIDE A SORT OF CYNERGY OR A SLEEP COCTAL THAT SEEMS TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE IN AIDING THE TRANSITION TO SLEEP SO APIGENIN IS THE SUBSTANCE THATIS FOUND IN CHIMOMILE AND FIFTY MELIGRAMS OF APIGENIN TAKE IN THIRTY MINUTES BEFORE SLEEP CAN ACT AS AT ANOTHER WAY TO SHUT OFF THE FOREBRAIN AND REDUCE RUMINATION REDUCE ANXIETY IN ALLOW PEOPLE TO FALL AND STAY ASLEEP I DID A PODCASTS WITH DOCTOR DARI A ROSE SHE'S GON EXCELLENT POD CAST THAT A HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU CHECK OUT COVERS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT HEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND OTHER SUBJECTS AND SHE'S A PEATIA NUROL SCIENCE TRIFICT SCIENTISTS ET CETERA I SHE'S A BIG FAN OF APIGENAN AS M INE AND THEN THE THIRD COMPOUND IS THEANINE T H E A AND I AND E THEANINE IS A COMPOUND THAT CAND ALSO INCREASE GABA BUT ALSO INCREASES ACTIVATION OF SOMETHING CALLED CHLORID CHANNELS CHLORI CHANNELS ARE ANOTHER WAY IN WHICH NURONS TURN THEMSELVES OFF OR TURNIN EACH OTHER OFF NOT TURN EACH OTHER OFF IN N THE WAY THEY RETYPICALLY HEAR LIKE THAT TURNS ME OFF BUT TURN THEM OFF IN SHUT THEM DOWN LOWER THEIR LOWER THEIR LEVELS OF ACTIVITY SO MAGNESIUM THREE INATOR BY GLICENATE APIGENAN AND THEANINE IN COMMINATION CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE FOR AITING THE TRANSITION O SLEEP AND I REALIZE THAT NOT EVERYONE WANTS TO TAKE SUPPLEMENTS I CERTAINLY AM NOT PUSHING ANY OF THESE I I WOULD HOPE THAT EVERYBODY BE ABLE TO FALL ASLEEP EASILY AND STAY ASLEEP FOR THE DURATION OF TIME THAT THEY WANT WITHOUT ANY SUPPLEMENTAL HELP BUT I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT SOME THINGS THAT LIE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN DOING NOTHING AND TAKING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS BECAUSE MANY OF THE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ASSOCIATED WITH SLEEP AND YOU ALL KNOW WHAT THOSE ARE CARRY OTHER SIDE EFFECTS THEY CAN A CREATE BAD DREAMS O OFTEN VERY DISTURBING DREAMS THEY CAN BE ADDICTIVE OR AT LEAST HABIT FORMING THEY CAN CREATE GROGGINESS IN THE MORNING SOMEWHERE SAFER THAN OTHERS IS A VARIETY OF THEM OUT THERE BUT FOR THOSE THAT WANT TO EXPLORE SUPPLEMENTS AND HOW THEY CAN IMPACK SLEEP THIS COMMINATION OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FOUR HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM THREE IN ATOR OR BY GLICENATE FIFTY MILEGRAMS OF APIGENAN AND A HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OF THEANINE ALONE OR IN COMMINATION HAVE BEEN A BENEFICIAL TO MANY PEOPLE AND THEIRE EXCELLENT STUDIES TO SUPPORT THOSE STATEMENTS AGAIN I SUGGEST YOU GO TO EXAMINE NOT COMMON LOOK UP THE HUMAN EFFECT MATRICS FOR EACH OF THOSE COMPOUNDS AND YOU CAN EXPLORE THEM ONE OF THE MORE INTERESTING ASPECTS TO MAGNESIUM THREE IN ATE AND BY GLICENATE IS THAT IT SEEMS TO HAVE SOME NURA PROTECTIVE EFFECTS AS WELL TAREN'T MANY STUDIES ON IT BUT THE FEW STUDIES THAT ARE THERE POINT TO THE FACT THAT MAGNESIUM THREE IN ATE MAGNESIUM BY GLICENATE CAN ALSO SUPPORT NURON HEALTH AND NURON LONGEVITY WAS JUST AN ADDED BONIS IN MY OPINION AND WHAT IF YOU WAKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THIS IS A VERY COMMON OCCURRENTS AND THEREARE TWO GENERAL THEMES AROUND WAKING UP IN THE MILL THE NIGHT THAT ONE CAN USE TOOLS TO COUNTERACT THE FIRST THEME IS IF YOUR SOMEBODY WHO IS TIRED IN THE EVENINGS AND OU CAN A PUSHING YOURSELF TO STAY AWAKE SO YOUARE GOING TO THE PARTY REARE PUSHING YOURSELF TO STUDY OR WORK WHEN IN FACT YOU'D LIKE TO GET INTO BED AT EIGHT THIRTY OR NINE AND THEN YOUR FALLING A SLEEP ROUND TEN THIRTY ELEVEN AND WAKING UP AT TWO THIRTY OR THREE IN THE MORNING YOU CAN'T FALL BACK TO SLEEP CHANCES ARE THAT YOUR MELATONAN PULSE WAS INITIATED EARLY IN THE NIGHT SO THAT A MELATONE IMPULSE STARTED PROBABLY AROUND EIGHT THIRTY OR NINE BUT YOUR STAYING UP YOUR BATTLING THAT MELOTONAN AND THEN SOME TIME AROUND TWO THIRTY OR THREE IN THE MORNI ING THAT MELATONAN IS NO LONGER PRESENT AT SUFFICIENTLY HIGH LEVELS IN YOUR BLOODSTREAM AND YOU'R WAKING UP YOU'RE ETTING YOUR MORNING CORTIS ALL PULSE SHIFTED INTO THOSE WE HOURS OF THE MORNING YOU MAY NOT LIKE THIS ADVICE BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO TO OFSID THAT IS TO SIMPLY GO TO BED EARLIER BY GOING TO BED EARLIER YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE LONGER DURATION OF SLEEP BUT I REALIZE THAT THERE ARE SOCIAL REASONS AND WORK RELATED REASONS WHY GOING TO BED AT EIGHT THIRTY OR NINE IS NOT NECESSARILY BENEFICIAL TO YOUR LIFE SO IN THAT CASE YOU MIGHT BE ONE OF THE RARE INDIVIDUALS FOR WHOM GETTING A LITTLE BIT MORE BRIGHT LIGHT IN THE EVENING COULD BE A GOOD THING SO THIS WOULD BE AROUND THE HOURS OF SEVEN OR EIGHT P M AND IN THAT WAY CAUSING THAT PULSE IN MELATONAN TO BE DELAYED BECAUSE AGAIN LIGHT INHIBITS MELATONAN NOW THE OTHER THING IS MANY PEOPLE WAKE UP IN TE MILL THE NIGHT BECAUSE OF ANXIETY OR BECAUSE THEY AFFUSE THE RESTAURUM IT'S PERFECTLY FIND TO FLIP ON THE LIGHTS BUT KEEP THE LIGHTS DIM BUT IF YOU FLIP ON THOSE LIGHTS TRY ND FLIP THEM OFF AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND TRYING GET BACK INTO BED AND IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE FALLING ASLEEP AGAIN AND YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED TO SLEEP THAT'S WHERE THESE ENESTY ARE THESE NON SLEEP DEEP REST PROTOCULSE CAN REALLY BE BENEFICIAL EVEN THOUGH THE ON THE ANAS THE NON SLEEP PART MIGHT MAKE YOU THINK THAT AH THEY WILL PREVENT YOU FROM FALLING ASLEEP RATHER THAN TRYING TO FIGHT YOUR MIND TRYING TO FIGHT ANXIETY WHICH IS ALWAYS A TERRIBLE THING TO DO I WU SAY IT'S VERY HARD TO CONTROL THE MIND WITH THE MIND LOOK TO THE BODY AND THAT'S WHAT ENESTY AR SCRIPTS DO THINGS LIKE EOGONEDRA EVEN THE A SLEEP HYPNOSIS DONE IN THE MIDDLE THE NIGHT IF YOU WAKE UP AND WANT TO FALL BACK TO SLEEP OFTEN TIMES WILL HELP YOU FALL BACK TO SLEEP IMMEDIATELY AND IF THEY DON'T THEY WILL LEAST PUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY INTO A STATE OF DEEP RELAXATION THAT MORE CLOSELY MIMIXS THE SLEEP STATE THAT YOU OUGHT TO BE IN THEN THE AWAKE RUMINATING STRESSING ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU'RE NOT SLEEPING STATE SO IF YOU WAKE UP IN THE MILL THE NIGHT REALLY TRY AND GET BACK TO SLEEP AND IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT BY DOING FOR INSTANCE LONG EXALE BREATHING WHICH CAN WORK YOU SOME OTHER TOOL OF THE BODY TO SHIFT THE MIND AND THE TOOLS THAT I'M RECOMMENDING ARE OF THE NON SLEEP DEEP REST VARIETY SO NOW WE'VE ESSENTIALLY TRAVELLED AROUND THE CLOCK SO TO SPEEK FROM THE TIME WHERE ONE WAKES UP UNTIL THE TIME THEY START WORKING UNTIL THE TIME THEY EXERCIZSE YE LUNCH DO AN ANASTY ARE HAD TO SLEEP GET TO SLEEP MAY BE WAKE UP GET BACK TO SLEEP ET CETERA I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT ALTHOUGH PEOPLE SCHEDULES VERY MOST PEOPLE ARE DOING MORE THAN ONE OR TO WORK BOUTS PER DAY AND INDEED I'M DOING MORE THAN ONE OR TWO WORKBOUTS PER DAY I REALLY EMPHASIZE THAT MORNING NINETY MENUTE WORK BLOCK BECAUSE I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD AGREE THAT THERE'S A PORTION OF EACH DAY AN WHICH WE NEED TO DO THE HARDEST THING OR THE MOST IMPORTANT THING OR THE THING THAT DEMANDS THE MOST OF OUR COGNATIVE SELF I POSITION THAT EARLY IN THE DAY AND IPPOSITION EVERYTHING AROUND THAT IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT IT HAPPENS AND THAT IT HAPPENS WITH THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF EFFICIENCY AND YES I MAKE SURE THAT T HAPPENS EVERY DAY AND THAT BRINGS ABOUT TWO OTHER IMPORTANT POINTS FIRST OF ALL WE DO HAVE THIS THING CALLED WEAK ENDS AND A I TEND TO TAKE ONE DAY OFF PER WEEK NOT BOTH A MUCH TO THE DISMAY OF PEOPLE IN MY LIFE AND COSTELLO BUT NONE THE LESS THERE IS SOME THING CALLED WEAK AND DRIFT WHICH IS THAT WE CAN BE VERY REGUMENTED ON A MONDAY OR A TUESDAY AND THEN EVEN IF WE'RE GOOD ABOUT MAINTAINING A SCHEDULE WHENCEDAY THURSDAY FRIDAY ET CETERA MOST OF ESS I WOULD HOPE WOULD ALTER THEIR SCHADULE SOMEWHAT ON THE WEEK ENDS IN ORDER TO RECOVER AND GET SOME ADDITIONAL REST AND I ONT EMPHASIZE I ABSOLUTELY DO THAT I TAKE ONE DAY PER WEEK WHERE I GO FULL COSTELLO WHERE I ESSENTIALLY DO NOTHING IN A STRUCTURED WAY AT LEAST IF I HAVE MY WAY I'M NOT MAKING ANY PLANS I'M COMPLETELY FREE TO EXPLORE WHAT I WANT TO DO AND WHEN I WANT TO DO IT THAT'S NOT THE WAY LIFE WORKS OUT OFTENTIMES THEIR SOCIAL ENGAGEMENTS AN OTHER THINGS THAT GET IN THE WAY OR THAT I ENJOY AND THAT BREAKS UP THE DAY BUT I DO TAKE REST I DON'T THINK THAT ONE HAS TO FOLLOW THE SAME SCHEDUL EVERY SINGLE DAY HOWEVER I DO THINK THERE ARE FEW THINGS THAT PEOPLE SHOULD DO EVERY SINGLE DAY IF POSSIBLE AND THOSE ARE GET MORNING SUNLIGHT BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T YOUR CIRCATIAN RHYTHMS AND YOUR HEALTH ET CETERA AND YOUR MOOD ARE GOING TO START TO DRIFT AND TO TRY AND GET SLEEP ON A REGULAR BASIS AND OF COURSE SOME OF THE GREATEST OF THINGS IN LIFE HAPPEN AFTER TEN P M AND SOME OF THOSE EVEN INVOLVE SLEEPLESS NIGHTS OF VARIOUS KINDS I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM HAVING A SOCIAL LIFE OR FROM HAVING A ROBUST PARTY LIFE IF THAT'S YOUR THING OR AH FOR ENJOYING LIFE AND BECAUSE THAT'S CERTAINLY ONE OF THE MAIN A THINGS THAT WE SHOULD ALL BE PURSUING IS TO ENJOY LIFE THE ONLY POINT I WANT TO MAKE ABOUT SLEEP IS THAT IF YOU HAPPEN TO STAY UP LATE IT STILL BEST TO GET UP AT YOUR REGULAR WAKE UP TIME IT'S A VERY SIMPLE SOLUTION TO A PROBLEM THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE HICH IS THEY STAY UP TILL TWO OR THREE IN THE MORNING AND THEN THEY TEND TO SLEEP LATE AND THEN ITTENDS TO DESTRUPT THEIR RHYTHM TRY ON MOST DAYS AND MOST NIGHTS TO WAKE UP AT MORE LESS THE SAME TIME AND TRY TO GO TO SLEEP AT MORE OR LESS THE SAME TIME IN FACT I WAS TALKING TO MAT WALKER ABOUT THIS RECENTLY AND HE WAS ALSO SURPRIZE TO SEE THESE NEW DATA AND I WAS SURPRISE TO SEE THESE NEW DATA THAT EMPHASIZE THAT IF YOU GET A POOR NIGHTS SLEEP OR IF YOU UP LATE THE PREVIOUS NIGHT FOR GOOD REASONS MANY PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY JUST WANT TO GO TO BED EARLY THE NEXT NIGHT BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT'S NOT THE BEST THING TO DO FOR YOUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TURM HEALTH TRY AND STAY UP TO THE POINT WHERE YOU WOULD NORMALLY STAY UP AND THEN GET TO SLEEP GO TO BED A COUPLE HOURS EARLIER ITS PINACANO KILL YOU BUT TRY TO NOT GO TO BED FOR INSTANCE THAT SIX P M BECAUSE YOU ARE UP THE ENTIRE NIGHT BEFORE THAT CAN REALLY BE DESRUPTIVE THE OTHER THING I WAN TO EMPHASIZE IS THAT EVEN THOUGH THAT MORNING NINETY MINUTE WORK BLOCK IS SO VITAL OF COURSE THERE'S A SECOND WORK BLOCK AND IN FACT I DESCRIBED ONE IN THE AFTERNOON AFTER THE ANES YEARE FOR ME THAT'S REVERY HYPNOSIS THERE'S A NINETY MENUTE WORK BLOCK IN WHICH I DROP IN AGAIN IN A NO INTERNECT CONNECTION NO PHONE KIND OF WAY TO COMPLETE SOME WORK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO ME SO COMBINE THAT'S JUST THREE HOURS OF FOCUS WORK WHICH MAY NOT SEEM LIKE A LOCK BUT IF YOU WERE TO DISSECT YOUR DAY AND COND OF LOOK AT THE ARK AND STRUCTURE OF YOUR DAY I'D BE WILLING TO BET THAT IF WE ADDET UP THE TOTAL PERIOD OF TIME IN WHICH YOU WERE IN WHAT CALNUWPORT WOULD CALLED DEEP WORK REALLY FOCUS DEDICATED WORK THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY AMOUNT TO ABOUT THREE OR FOUR HOURS IF YOU CAN SQUEEZE IN ANOTHER NINETYMEN ATE WORK BLOCK OR IF YOU CAN GET FOUR NINETUMEN UTE WORK BLOCKS WILL THEN MORE POWER TO YOU BUT I THINK MOST PEOPLE FIND THAT ONE OR TWO OF THESE REALLY DEEP FOCUS NINEUMEN T WORK BLOCKS ARE ABOUT WHAT ONE SCHAEDUL AND EVEN MIND CAN HANDLE AND OF COURSE THROUGHOUT THE DAY THERE ARE OTHER THINGS HAPPENING OUTSIDE OF THOSE NINETYMEN AT WORK BLOCKS I'M CHECKING MY TEXMESSAGES I'M CHECKING MY EMALE I'M RESPONDING TO VARIOUS DEMANDS IM WORKING ANTENDING TO LIFE SO WHILE I'VE CARVED SOME BOUNDARIES OR DELINEATES SANE BOUNDARIES AROUND THOSE WORK BLOCKS AND I'M CERTAIN THAT IF YOU DO TOO YOU WILL BENEFIT FROM THEM THEY ARE CERTAINLY NOT THE ONLY PERIODS OF TIME EACH DAY IN WHICH I OR I BELIEVE OTHER PEOPLE SHOULD BE TRYING TO LEARN ORE TRYING TO FOCUS AND I WANT EMPHASIZE THAT EVEN THOUGH MY JOB IS TO DISCOVER KNOWLEDGE AND DISTRIBUTE KNOWLEDGE BECAUSE I'M A SCIENTISTS I REALIZE THAT NINETY MENUTE WORK BLOCKS OF THE SORT THAT I'M DESCRIBING MAY NOT APPLY SPECIFICALLY TO THE KINDS OF WORK YOU DO IF YOU'RE AN ARTISTS OR A SCULPTOR WHERE YOU BUILD FURNITURE OR WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU HAPPEN TO YOU TEACH CHILDREN OR THEY TEACH YOU WHATEVER IT HAPPENS TO BE OF COURSE PLEASE ADAPT AND MODIFY WHAT I'VE DESCRIBED TO DAY IN WAYS THAT BEST SERVE YOU AND YOUR SCHADUL WHAT I'VE TRIED TO DO IS PROVIDE YOU A PICTURE OF THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS SCHEDULE THAT I FOLLOW AND WHY I DO CERTAIN THINGS AT PARTICULAR TIMES IND WHY I DO THOSE PARTICULAR THINGS ANDI'VE REALLY TRIED TO EMPHASIZE THE SCIENTIFIC RATUR NAL BEHIND THOSE THINGS THE PURE EVIEWED DATA IN SOME CASES I'VE POINTED OUT THE SPECIFIC PAPERS IN OTHER CASES I'VE REFERRED TO LARGE BODIES OF WORK THAT SUPPORT THESE PRACTICES WHEN I SAY LARGE BODIES OF WORK I'M A BIG FAN OF LOOKING TO THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE AND ASKING WHERE IS THE CENTERE OF MASS FOR A PARTICULAR TOPIC FOR INSTANCE WHERE IS THERE FIFTY OR A HUNDRED OR A THOUSAND PAPERS THAT FOR INSTANCE SUPPORT MORNING LIGHT VIEWING IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE MELATONAN SECRETION LATER THAT IN THE DAY COURT IS ALL SECRETIAN EARLY IN THE DAY MOOD METABOLISM ET CETERA IF ONE WORE TO PUT INTO PUB MED LIGHT METABOLISM AND MOOD YOU WOULD LITERALLY GET TENS OF THOUSANDS MAYBEVEN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDIES SO WHEN I SAY THE CENTER OF MASS WHAT I'VE REALLY TRIED TO DO IS EXAMINE THE LITERATURE AND FIGURE OUT WHERE THERE IS A A SORT OF A DIRECTIVE PROTOCAL THAT EMERGES FROM ALL THESE VARIOUS STUDIES THAT USED DYUNOW IN SOME CASES ANIMALS IN MANY CASES HUMANS AND EXPLORE DIFFERENT WHAT WE CALL DEPENDENT VARIABLES SOME STUDIES WERE LOOKING AT EFFECTS ON BLOODSUGAR OTHER ON MOOD SO I HOPE THAT MAKES CLEAR WHY THE RATIONAL BEHIND WHAT IE PROVIDED TO DAY IF YOURE LEARNING FROM THE SPODCAST AND

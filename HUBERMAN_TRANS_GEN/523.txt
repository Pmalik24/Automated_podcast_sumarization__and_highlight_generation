WELCOME TO THE HUBERMN LO SCIENCE SCIENCE PATO RI MAN DREW HUBERMEN AND I'M A PROFESSOR OF NEUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS T STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AN EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTIC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I LIKE THE THANK THE SPONSORS OF TODAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS ATHLETIC GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AN TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THE REASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GRENS AN THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIGREENS ONCE OR TWICE TO DAY IS THAT T HELPS ME COVER ALL OF MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGHT HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH OUR VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GOP MICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WITH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSENTIALLY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITHOUT LETIC GREENS IT GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED AND THE PROBIOCS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIOM IF YOU LIKE TO TRY ATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY' GIVE YOU FIV FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THREE K TOO THERE ARE TON OF DAT AND OW SHOWING THAT VITEMEND THREE IS ESSENSIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH EVEN IF FOR GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICIEN IN VITEMEN D THREE AND K TOO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CARVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATHLTIC GREENSTOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FIFRE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEND THREE K TO TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENTS IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND PATASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR AVE TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLE OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLITES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AN ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AN POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOS ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEMS CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLITES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IF HYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOUR GETTING THE PROPARATIOES OF ELECTROLITES IF YOU' LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEEMEN T DOK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND YOU'LL GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPL PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THERE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT A TRY ELEMEN YOU CAN GO TO ELE MENT ELEMENTE DACAM SLASH HUBERMAN THIS MONTH ON THE HUBERMAN LABPODCAST WERE TALKING ALL ABOUT PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE SO THAT MEANS ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE RECREATIONAL EXERCISE WAIT LIFTING RUNNING SWIMMING YOGA SKILLS AND SKILL LEARNING TO DAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT AND FOCUS ON SKILL LEARNING WE ARE GOING TO FOCUS ON HOW TO LEARN SKILLS MORE QUICKLY IN PARTICULAR MOTOR SKILLS THIS WILL ALSO TRANSLATE TO THINGS LIKE MUSICAL SKILLS IN PLAYING INSTRUMENTS BUT WE'RE MAINLY GONTOFOCUS ON PHYSICAL MOVEMENTS OF THE BODY THAT EXTEND BEYOND THE HANDS LIKE JUST PLAYING THE PIANO OR THE FINGERS LIKE PLAYING THE GUITAR BUT EVERYTHING WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT WILL ALSO SERVE THE FORMATION AND THE CONSOLIDATION AND THE PERFORMANCE OF OTHER TYPES OF SKILLS SO IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN HOW TO PERFORM BETTER WHETHER NOT ITS DANCE OR YOGA OR EVEN SOMETHING THATS JUST VERY REPETITIVE LIKE RUNNING OR SWIMMING THIS PODCAST EPISODE IS FOR YOU WE'RE GOING TO GO DEEPENTO THE SCIENCE OF SKILL LEARNING AND WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT VERY SPECIFIC PROTOCOLS THAT THE SCIENCE POINTS TO AND HAS VERIFIED ALLOW YOU TO LEARN MORE QUICKLY TO IMBED THAT LEARNING SO THAT YOU REMEMBER IT AND TO BE ABLE TO BUILD UP SKILLS MORE QUICKLY THAN YOU WOULD OTHERWISE WE ARE ALSO GOING TO TOUCH ON A FEW THINGS THAT I GET ASKED ABOUT A LOT BUT FORTUNATELY RECENTLY I'VE HAD THE TIME TO GO DEEP INTO THE LITERATURE EXTRACT THE DATA FOR YOU AND THAT'S MENTAL VISUALIZATION HOW DOES VISUALIZING A PARTICULAR SKILL OR PRACTICE SERVE THE LEARNING AND OR THE CONSOLIDATION OF THAT PRACTICE TURNS OUT THERE ARE SOME ABSOLUTELY STRIKING PROTOCOLS THAT ONE CAN USE STRIKING MEANING THEY ALLOW YOU TO LEARN FASTER AND THEY ALLOW YOU TO REMEMBER HOW TO DO THINGS MORE QUICKLY AND BETTER THEN IF YOU WERE NOT DONG THIS MENTAL REHEARSAL BUT THE PATTERN OF MENTAL REHEARSAL AND WHEN YOU DO THAT MENTAL REHEARSAL TURNS OUT TO BE VITALLY IMPORTANT SO I'M EXCITED FOR TO DAY'S EPISODE WE'RE GOING TO SHARE A LOT OF INFORMATION WITH YOU AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE A LOT OF VERY SIMPLE TAKE AWAYS SO LET'S GET STARTED BEFORE WE GET INTO THE TOPIC OF SKILL LEARNING AND TOOLS FOR ACCELERATING SKILL LEARNING I WANT AF BRIEFLY REVISIT THE TOPIC OF TEMPERATURE WHICH WAS COVERED IN THE LAST EPISODE AND JUST HIGHLIGHT OF FEW THINGS IN CLEAR UP SOME MISUNDERSTANDINGS SO LAST EPISODE TALKED ABOUT THESE INCREDIBLE DATA FROM MY COLI CRAG HELLERS SLAB AT STAMFORD HE'S IN THE DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY SHOWING THAT COOLING THE PALMS IN PARTICULAR WAYS AND AT PATICULAR TIMES CAN ALLOW ATHLETES OR JUST RECREATIONAL EXERCISERS TO DO MORE PULL UPS DIPS BENCH PRESSES PER UNIT TIME TO RUN FURTHER TO PCYCHAL FURTHER AND TO FEEL BETTER DOING IT THERE REALLY ARE INCREDIBLE DATA THAT ARE ANCHORED IN THE BIOLOGY OF THE VASCULAR SYSTEM THE BLOOD SUPPLY AND HOW IT'S INVOLVED IN COOLING US MANY OF YOU DOZENS OF YOU IN FACT SAID WAIT A SECOND YOU GAVE US A PROTOCAL IN THIS EPISODE WHICH SAYS THAT WE SHOULD COOL OUR PALMS PERIODICALLY THROUGHOUT EXERCISE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DO MORE WORK BUT ON THE EPISODE BEFORE THAT ON GROWTH HORMONE AND FIROID HORMONE YOU SAID THAT HEATING UP THE BODY IS GOOD FOR RELEASE OF GROWTH HORMON AND I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT BOTH THINGS ARE TRUE THESE ARE TOO SEPARATE PROTOCALS YOU SHOULD ALWAYS WARM UP BEFORE YOU EXERCISE THAT WARM UP WILL NOT INCREASE YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE OR THE MUSCLE TEMPERATURE TO THE POINT WHERE IT'S GOING TO DIMINISH YOUR WORK CAPACITY THAT IT'S GON HARM YOUR PERFORMANCE THE COOLING OF THE PALMS WHICH IS REALLY JUST A ROUTE TO COOL YOUR CORE IN AN EFFICIENT WAY THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY IN FACT IS ABOUT IMPROVING PERFORMANCE HEATING UP THE BODY WITH EXERCISE AND FOCUSSING ON HEAT EAT INCREASES OR USING SANA FOR HEAT INCREASES IS GEARED TOWARD GROWTH HORMONE RELEASE WHICH IS A SEPARATE MATTER SO YOU CAN DO BOTH OF THESE PROTOCALS BUT YOU WOULD WANT TO DO THEM AT SEPARATE TIMES SUCH JAS TO MAKE THIS VERY CONCRETE BEFORE I MOVE ON TO TO DAY'S TOPIC IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN DOING MORE WORK BEING ABLE TO DO MORE SETS AND RAPS PER UNIT TIME AND FEEL BETTER DOING IT OR TO RUN FURTHER OR TO CYCHLE FURTHER THEN COOLING THE PALMS PERIODICALLY AS I DESCRIBED IN THE PREVIOUS EPISODE IS GOING TO BE THE WAY TO GO IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN GETTING GROWTH HORMONE RELEASE WELL THEN HOT PSANA AND I OFFERED SOME OTHER TOOLS IF YOU DON'T HAV ASANA IN THE EPISODE ON GROWTH HORMONE AND THIEROID HARMON I'S GONG TO BE THE WAY TO GO KAS SO THOSE ARE SEPARATE PROTOCALS YOU CAN INCLUDE THEM IN YOUR IN YOUR FITNESS REGIME AND YOUR A TRAINING REGIME BUT YOU DO WANT TO DO THEM AT SEPARATE TIMES AND AS AT LAST POINT ABOUT THIS I ALSO MENTION THAT KAFFINE CAN EITHER HELP OR HINDER PERFORMANCE DEPENDING ON WHETHER NOT YOUR KAFFINE ADAPTED BECAUSE OF THE WAYS THAT KAFFINE IMPACTS BODY TEMPERATURE AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS LIKE VASO DILATION IN CONSTRICTION IT'S VERY SIMPLE IF YOU ENJOY KAFFINE BEFORE YOUR WORK OUTS AND YOUR ACCUSTOMED TO KAFFINE MEANING YOU DRINK IT THREE OR FIVE TIMES OR MORE A WEEK HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS  IS A TYPICAL DAILY DOSE OF AFFINE SOME OF YOU ARE INJESTING MORE SOME LESS IF YOU DO THAT REGULARLY WELL THEN IT'S GOING TO BE JUST FINE TO INJEST KAFFINE BEFORE YOU TRAIN IT'S NOT GOING TO IMPACT YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE IN YOUR VEZO DILATION OR CONSTRICTION IND WAYS THAT WILL HINDER YOU HOWEVER IF YOU'RE NOT A REGULAR KAFFINE USER AND YOU'RE THINKING OH I'M GOING TO DRINK A CUP OF COFFEE AND GET THIS HUGE PERFORMANCE INHANCING EFFECT WELL THAT'S NOT CON A HAPPEN CHANCES ARE IT'S GOING TO LEAD TO INCREASES IN BODY TEMPERATURE AND CHANGES IN THE WAY THAT BLOOD FLOW IS HAPPENING IN YOUR BODY ND IN PARTICULAR ON THESE PALMER SURFACES AND IN YOUR FACE THAT IS GOING TO LIKELY DIMINISH PERFORMANCE SO IF YOU ENJOY KAFFINE AND YOUR ACCUSTOMED TO IT SO CALL KAFIN ADAPTED IN JOY IT BEFORE YOUR TRAINING IF YOU REGULARLY IEXCUSE ME IF YOU DO NOT REGULARLY USE CAFFINE THEN YOU PROBABLY DO NOT ONE OF YOU CAFFINE AS A PERFORMANCE ENHANCING TOOL AND WHILE WE'RE ON THE TOPIC OF TOOLS AND BECAUSE THIS IS A MONTH ON ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE AND EXERCISE AND PHYSICAL SKILL LEARNING I WANT TO OFFER AN ADDITIONAL TOOL THAT I'VE CERTAINLY FOUND USEFUL WHICH IS HOW TO RELIEVE THE SO CALLED SIDE STITCH OR SIDE CRAMP WHEN RUNNING OR SWIMMING THIS ACTUALLY RELATES TO RESPIRATION AND TO THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND IT IS NOT A CRAMP IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN OUT RUNNING AND YOU FELT LIKE YOU HAD A A PAIN ON YOUR SIDE THAT PAIN COULD BE ANY NUMBER OF THINGS BUT THAT WHAT FEELS LIKE CRAMPING OF YOUR SIDE IS ACTUALLY DUE TO WHAT'S CALLED COLLATERALIZATION OF THE FRENIC NERVE WHICH IS A LOT HARDER TO SAY THAN A SIDE CRAMP OR A SIDE STITCH BUT HERE'S THE SITUATION YOU HAVE A SET OF NERVES WHICH IS CALLED THE FRENIC NERVE P H RE E AN I C THE FRENIC NERVE WHICH EXTENDS DOWN FROM YOUR BRAIN STEM ESSENTIALLY THIS REGION TO YOUR DIAPHRAM TO CONTROL YOUR BREATHING IT HAS A COLLATERAL MEANING HAS A BRANCH JUST LIKE THE BRANCH ON A TREE THAT INERVATES YOUR LIVER AND IF YOU ARE NOT BREATHING DEEPLY ENOUGH WHAT CAN HAPPEN IS YOU CAN GET WHAT'S COLED SOMETIMES A REFERENCED PAIN REFERENCE PAIN IS PROBLYC CAN BE FAMILIAR TO ANY OF YOU HAVE EVER READ ABOUT HOW TO RECOGNIZE HEART ATTACK IN A YOU HAVE HEART ATTACKS WILL SOME AVS HAVE PAIN ON ONE SIDE OF THEIR BODY THE LEFT ARM SOMETIMES PEOPLE TO HAVE PAIN IN A PART OF THEIR BACK WILL SUDDENLY ALSO GET PAIN IN THEIR SHOULDER OR PART OF THEIR FACE THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE FACKT THAT MANY ARE OF OUR NERVES BRANCH AND ARE MEANING THEIR COLLATERALIZE TO DIFFERENT ORGANS AND AREAS OF THE BODY AND THE WAY THOSE NERVES ARE WOVEN TOGETHER IT'S OFTEN THE CASE THAT IF WE DISRUPT THE PATTERN OF FIRING OF ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY IN ONE OF THOSE NERVE BRANCHES THAT THE OTHER ONES ARE AFFECTED TO THE SIDE STITCH THE PAIN IN YOUR SIDE IS OFTEN BECAUSE OF THE CONTRACTIONS OF THE DIAPHRAM BECAUSE OF THE WAY YOURE BREATHING WHILE YOUR EXERCISING RUNNING OR SWIMMING OR BIKING AND AS A CONSEQUENCE YOU FEEL PAIN IN YOUR SIDE BUT THAT'S NOT A CRAMP THE WAY TO RELIEVE IT IS VERY SIMPLE YOU DO THE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIDE THAT I'VE TALKED ABOUT IN PREVIOUS A EPISODES OF THE PODCAST AND ELSEWHERE WHICH IS A DOUBLE INHAIL THROUGH THE NOSE VERY DEEP AND THEN A LONG EXAL AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO REPEAT THAT TWO OR THREE TIMES TYPICALLY THAT WILL RELIEVE THE SIDE STITCH BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT IT CHANGES THE FIRING PATTERNS OF THE FRENIC NERVE SO THE SIDE STITCH IS ANNOYING ITS PAINFUL SOMETIMES WHEN YOU THINK WERE DEHYDRATED AND YOU MIGHT BE DEHYDRATED BUT OFTENTIMES IS JUST THAT WE'RE BREATHING IN A WAY THAT CAUSES SOME REFERENCED PAIN OF THE LIVER WE CALLED A SIDE STITCH OR A SIDE CRAMP AN YOU CAN RELIEVE IT VERY EASILY THROUGH THE DOUBLE INHAIL LONG EXHAIL THAT PATTERN DONE TWO OR THREE TIMES OFTEN YOU CAN CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN THE EXERCISE WHILE YOU DO THE DOUBLE INHAIL EXHAIL AND IT WILL JUST RELIEVE ITSELF THAT WAY SO GIVE IT A TRY IF YOU EXPERIENCE THE SIDE STITCH SOME PEOPLE I KNOW ARE ALSO DOING THE DOUBLE INHAIL LONG EXHAIL JURING LONG CONTINUOUS BOUTS OF EXERCISE I ACTUALLY DO THIS WHEN I RUN WE HAVE DECENT DATA ALTHOUGH THESE ARE STILL UNPUBLISHED DATA THAT THAT CAN ENGAGE AT KIND OF REGULAR CADENCE OF HEART RATE VERYABILITY SO THERE NUMBER REASONS WHY THIS PHYSIOLOGICAL SIDE CAN BE USEFUL BUT IT CERTAINLY CAN BE USEFUL FOR RELIEVING THE SIDE STITCH OR SO CALLED SIDE CRAMP LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ACQUISITION OF NEW SKILLS THESE COULD BE SKILLS SUCH AS A GULF SWING OR A TENNIS SWING OR YOU'RE SHOOTING FREE THROWS OR YOU'RE LEARNING TO DANCE OR YOU'RE LEARNING AN INSTRUMENT I MAINLY GOING TO FOCUS ON ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE THE'RE BASICALLY TWO TYPES OF SKILLS OPEN LOOP AND CLOSED LOOP OPEN LOOP SKILLS OUR SKILLS WHERE YOU PERFORM SOME SORT OF MOTOR ACTION AND THEN YOU WAIT AND YOU GET IMMEDIATE FEED BACK AS TO WHETHER NOT IT WAS DONE CORRECTLY OR NOT A GOOD EXAMPLE WOULD BE THROWING DARTS AT A DARTBOARD SO IF YOU THROW THE DART YOU GET FEED BACK ABOUT WHETHER NOT YOU HIT THE BULL'S EYE YOU'RE OFF THE DARTBOARD OR YOU'RE SOME OTHER LOCATION ON THE DARTBOARD THAT'S OPEN LOOP CLOTHES LOOP WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT'S MORE CONTINUOUS SO LET'S SAY YOUR RUNNER AND YOU'RE STARTING TO DO SOME SPEED WORK AND SOME SPRINTE AND YOU'RE RUNNING AND YOU CAN KIND OF FEEL WHETHER NOT YOURE RUNNING CORRECTLIOR MAYBE EVEN HAVE A COACH AND THEY'RE CORRECTING YOUR STRIDE OR YOUR TRYING TO A DO SOME SORT OF SKILL LIKE THE LIKE A HOP SCOTCH SKILL OF WHICH A YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU'RE DOING THE LATTER WORK WHERE YOUR STEPPING BETWEEN A DESIGNATED SPACEIS ON THE GROUND THAT'S CLOTHES LOOP BECAUSE AS YOU GO YOU CAN ADJUST YOUR BEHAVIOR AND YOU CAN ADJUST THE DISTANCE OF YOUR STEPS OR YOU CAN A JUST YOUR SPEED OR YOU CAN ADJUST YOUR POSTURE AND YOU ARE ABLE TO ESSENTIALLY DO MORE PRACTISE PERUNIT TIME BUT YOU'RE GETTING FEED BACK ON A MOMENT TO MOMENT BASIS O CACE YOU HAVE OPEN LOOP AND CLOTHES LOOP AND JUST TO MAKE THIS VERY VERY CLEAR OPEN LOOP WOULD BE PRACTICING YOUR TENNIS SERVE SO LET'S SAY THAT YOU SET A TARGET ON THE OTHER SIDE THE NET YOU THROW THE BALL UP AND YOU YOU A HIT THE BALL IT GOES OVER THAT'S OPEN LOOP YOU'LL KNOW WHETHER NOT YOU ARE IN THE CORK YOU ARE ON THE LOCATION YOU WANTED TO HIT OR CLOSE TO IT OR NOT THAT'S OPEN LOOP CLOSED LOOP WOULD BE IF YOU ARE IN A REGULAR CANESO MAYBE OURE LEARNING A SWIM STROKE OR MAYBEOU'RE TRYING TO LEARN A PARTICULAR RHYTHM ON THE DRUM SO MAY BE OU'RE TRYING TO LEARN A PARTICULAR BEAT I'M NOT VERY MUSICAL SO NOT CAN EMBARRASS MYSELF BY GIVING AN EXAMPLE OF THIS AL THE LATER I I I WIL AH WHERE YOU'RE TRYING TO GET A PARTICULAR RHYTHM DOWN AND IF YOU'RE NOT GETTING IT YOU CAN ADJUST IN REAL TIME AND TRY AND CATCH OUP OR SLOW DOWN OR SPEED UP ET CETERA O CASO HOPFULL YOU'LL UNDERSTAND OPEN LOOP AND CLOSE LOOP YOU SHOULD ALWAYS KNOW BEFORE YOU TRY AND LEARN A SKILL WHETHER NOT'S OPEN LOOP OR CLOSE LOOP AND I'LL RETURN TO WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT SHORTLY BUT FYOU INL LEARN SOMETHING ASK   OPEN LOOP OR CLOSE LOOP THERE ARE ESSENTIALLY THREE COMPONENTS OF ANY SKILL THAT INVOLVES MOTOR MOVEMENT AND THOSE ARE CENSORY PERCEPTION A SHALL PERCEIVING WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND WHAT'S HAPPENING AROUND YOU SO WHAT YOU SEE WHAT YOU HEAR SOMETIMES YOUR PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING SPECIFICALLY LIKE THE TRAJECTORY OF YOUR ARM OR HOW YOU'RE MOVING YOUR FEET IF YOU'RE LEARNING TO DANCE SOMETIMES YOU'RE MORE FOCUS ON SOMETHING THAT'S HAPPENING OUTSIDE OF YOU LIKE YOU'RE LISTENING FOR SOMETHING IN MUSIC OR YOUR PAYING ATTENTION TO THE WAY YOUR PARTNER IS MOVING ET CETERA SO THERES CENSORY IMPUT THEN THEREARE THE ACTUAL MOVEMENTS I SO THERE ARE THE MOVEMENTS OF YOUR LIMBS IN BODY AND THEN THERE'S  SOMETHING CALLED PROPRIOCEPTION AMPROPRIA RECEPTION IS OFTEN DISCUSSE AS KIND OF A SIXTH CENSE OF KNOWING WHERE YOUR LIMBS ARE IN RELATION TO YOUR BODY SO PROPRIACEPTION IS VITALLY IMPORTANT IF I REACH DOWN AND PICK UP THIS PEN AND PICK IT UP I'M NOT THINKING ABOUT WHERE THE PEN AND MY HAND IS RELATIVE TO MY BODY BUT PROPRIACEPTIVELY I'M AWARE OF IT HAT KIND OF A SIX CENT DEEPER SUBCONSCIOUS LEVEL I CAN ALSO MAKE MYSELF AWARE OF WHERE OF WHERE MY LIMBS ARE AND TYPICALLY WHEN WE LEARN WE ARE PLACING MORE FOCUS ON PROPRIOCEPTION THAN WE DO ORDINARILY SO IF I GET UP FROM THIS CHAIR AND I HAPPEN TO WALK OUT OF THE ROOM I DON'T THINK ABOUT WHERE MY FEET AR LANDING RELATIVE TO ONE ANOTHER BUT IF MY LEG HAD FALLEN A SLEEP BECAUSE I HAD BEEN I YOU KNA LEANING ON ONE OF THE NERVES OF MY LEG OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND MY LEG FEELS ALL TINGLLY OR NUN YOU I AND YOU IF THES SORT HAPPEN YOU WOULD IMMEDIATELY NOTICE A SHIFT IN GAIT IT WOULD FEEL STRANGE I'D HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO HOW I'M STEPPING AND THE REASON IS I'M NOT GETTING ANY PROPRIAE CEPTIVE FEED BACK NOW SKILL LEARNING HAS A LOT OF OTHER DIMENSIONS TO BUT THOSE OF THE MAIN ONES THAT WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON SO AS TO REMIND YOU ITS YOU NEED TO KNOW OPEN LOOPER CLOTHES LOOP AND YOU NEED TO KNOW WHITHER NOT T EXCUSE ME YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT THERE'S CENSORY PERCEPTION WHAT YOUR PAYING ATTENTION TO MOVEMENTS THEMSELVES AMD PROPRIA CEPTION AND THERE'S ONE OTHER IMPORTANT THING THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW WHICH IS THAT MOVEMENT OF ANY KIND IS GENERATED FROM ONE TWO OR THREE SOURCES WITHIN YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM WITHIN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY THESE ARE CENSUAL PATTERN GENERATORS WHICH ARE SOMETIMES CALLED C ESPGS EXCUSE ME C P C SES SE S PGES ARE SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT IN BIOLOGY AH C P G ESSES THIS DISCOSE TO SHOW THAT I HAVE A MODULE C ESPEGIES ARE CONDROIT AND SULPHAC PRODC LIKENS THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS TOPIC C P G ESSES ARE CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATORS OR C P GS THE'RE SOMETIMES CALLED THESE C P GS ARE IN YOUR SPINAL CORD MINE AND YOURS DIFFERENT ONES AND THEY GENERATE REPETITIVE MOVEMENTS SO IF YOU'RE WALKING IF YOU'RE RUNNING IF YOU'RE CYCLING IF YOU'RE BREATHING WHICH PRESUME WLL YOU ARE AND YOU'RE DOING THAT IN A REGULAR RHYTHMIC CADENTS CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATORS ARE CONTROLLING THAT MOVEMENT AFTER YOU LEARN HOW TO WALK RUN SWIM CYCLE DO ANYTHING REALLY MUCH OF THE WORK IS HANDED OFF TO THESE CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATORS AND THERE WERE EXPERIMENTS THAT WERE DONE IN THE SIXTY SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES THAT ASHALLY LOOKED AT DECEREBRATE ANIMALS AND EVEN DICEREBRATE HUMANS THESE ARE HUMANS AND ANIMALS THAT LACK A CEREBRAL QARTEXS THEY LACK MUCH OF THE BRAIN AND YET THEY CAN ENGAGE IN WHAT'S CALLED FICTIVE MOVEMENT SO IT SOUNDS LIKE GET HOW TO BARBARIC EXPERIMENT I'M GLAD I WASN'T THE ONE TO HAVE TO DO THEM BUT THIS IS THE STUFF OF NURO SCIENCE TEXT BOOKS THAT CATS THAT OR DOGS OR MICE THAT HAVE THEIR YO QARTEXS WRE MOVED PUT THEM ON A TREADMILL THEY'LL WALK JUST FINE AND THEY WILL ADJUST THEIR SPEED OF WALKING JUST FINE EVEN THOUGH THEY BASILY LACK ALL THEIR THINKING DECISION MAKING BRAIN ND IT TURNS OUT HUMANS THAT HAVE UNFORTUNATELY MASSIVE STROKES TO THEIR QARTEC AND LACKANY NEO QARTEC BUT PRESERVE THESE CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATORS WILL ALSO WALK JUST FINE EVEN THOUGH THEY LACK ANY OF THE OTHER STUFF IN THE BRAIN SO THESE C P GS OR C P G SES ARE AMAZING AND THEY CONTROL A LOT OF OUR ALREADY LEARN BEHAVIOR WHEN YOU'RE REALLY GOOD AT SOMETHING C P GS ARE CONTROLLING A LOT OF THAT BEHAVIOR THAT'S TRUE ALSO FOR A GOLF SWING EVEN IF IT'S NOT REALLY REPETITIVE SOMEBODY WHOSE REALLY GOOD AT GOLF IS GAN I GS I CALL IT A T YOU PUT THE BALL ON THE TE A SHOW OF MY KNOWLEDGE OF GOLL I'VE ONLY DONE MINY GOLF FRANKLY UN A BUT SOME DAY MAY BE I'LL LEARN HOW TO GOLF BAT YOS SET THE GOLF BALL DOWN AND SWING SAIT THE BALL GOLF ALL DOWN SWING CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATORS ARE GOING TO HANDL LOT OF THAT IF I WERE TO GO TO THE GOLF COURSE STAMFERED AS A BEAUTIFUL GOLF CORSE IF I WERE TO GO OUT THEYRE PUT A BALL ON THE TE MY CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATOES WOULD NOT BE INVOLVED IN THAT AT ALL THE MOMENT I GET YOU BRINGN THE CLUB BACK TO SWING IT'S GOING TO ENGAGE OTHER THINGS AND THE OTHER THINGS IT'S GOING TO ENGAGE BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THAT BEHAVIOR NOW OR THEN IS UPPER MOTOR NURONS WE HAVE MOTOR NURONS IN OUR QARTEC IN OUR NEO QARTEC THAT CONTROLL DELIBERATE ACTION AND THOSE ORE THE ONES THAT YOU'RE ENGAGING WHEN YOU ARE LEARNING THOSE ORE THE ONES THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION IN ORDER TO ENGAGE AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING FOR INSTANCE IF I DECIDE UP EN A REACH DOWN AND PICK UP MY PEN WHICH I RARELY THINK ABOUT BUT NOW I'M THINKING ABOUT IN IMAN TO DO THIS IN A VERY DELIBERATE WAY OM IN AGRAB WITH THESE TWO FINGERS AND LIFT MY UPPER MOTOR NERONS AR NOW INVOLVED OK SO UPPER MOTOR NERONS ARE VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE A LITTLE BIT LATER IN THE EPISODE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HOW TO USE VISUALIZATION IN ORDER TO ACCELERATE SKILL LEARNING IT'S GOING TO LEVERAGE THESE UPPER MOTOR NERONS IN VERY PARTICULAR WAYS K SO WE HAVE SEPHGES FOR RHYTHMIC MOVEMENT UPPER MOTOR NERONS FOR DELIBERATE UNLEARNED MOVEMENTS OR MOVEMENTS THAT WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF LEARNING AND THEN WE HAVE WHAT ARE CALLED LOWER MOTOR NER ONS LOWER MOTOR NRONS OF THE ONES IN OUR SPINAL CORD THAT SEND LITTLE WIRES OUT TOR MUSCLES WHICH ACTUALLY CAUSE THE FIRING OF THOSE MUSCLE FIBRS OK SO THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS AS YOU'VE GOT UPPER MOTOR NERONS WHICH TALK TO SP GEES AND TO LOWER MOTOR NRON SO IT'S REALLY SIMPLE AND NOW YOU KNOW MOST TO EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT THE NURAL PATHWAYS CONTROLLING MOVEMENT AT LEAST FOR SAKE OF THIS DISCUSSION SO ANY TIME WE LEARN SOMETHING WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT TO PLACE OUR CENSORY PERCEPTION ON MEANING WHAT ARE WE GOING TO FOCUS ON THAT'S CRITICAL IFYOU'RE LISTENING THIS AND YOU THE TYPE OF PERSON LIGHTS TAKING NOTES THIS SHOULD BE THE SECOND QUESTION YOU ASK THE REMEMBER THE FIRST QUESTION IS IS A OPEN LOOP OR CLOSE LOOP THE SECOND QUESTION SHOULD BE WHAT SHOULD I FOCUS MY ATTENTION ON AUDITORY ATTENTION VISUAL ATTENTION OR PROPRIAT CEPTION SHOULD I FOCUS ON WHERE MY LIMBS ARE RELATIVE TO MY BODY OR SHOULD I FOCUS ON THE OUTCOME EF THIS IS A CRITICAL DISTINCTION YOU CAN DECIDE TO LEARN HOW TO DO A GULF SWING OR LEARN HOW TO SHOOT FREE THROWS OR LEARN HOW TO DANCE TANGO AND DECIDE THAT YOU ARE GOING TO FOCUS ON THE MOVEMENTS OF YOUR PARTNER OR THE POSITIONS OF YOUR FEET YOU MAYBE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT THEM MAYBE OURE GOING TO SENSE THEM YOU'RE GOING ACHALY FEEL WHERE THEY ARE OR MAYBE YOU ARE GOING TO SENSE THE POSITION AN POSTURE OF YOUR BODY WHICH IS MORE PROPRIACEPTIVE OK SO YOU HAVE TO ALICATE YOUR ATTENTION AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU HOW TO ALLICATE YOUR ATTENTION BEST IN ORDER TO LEARN FASTER SO THESE ISE THE SORTS OF DECISIONS THAT YOU HAVE TO MAKE FORTUNATELY FOR YOU YOU DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER NOT YOU'RE GON TO USE YOUR UPPER MOTOR NER ONS AND YOU'RE LOWER MOTOR NERONS OR NOT BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO SOMETHING YOU'R AUTOMATICALLY GOING TO ENGAGE YOUR UPPER MOTOR NEROS AND IF YOU DO YOU ARE ALL RIT THEN YOURE NOCCAN USE YOUR UPPER MOTORNRONS YOU'R MAINLY GOING TO RELY ON CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATORS YOU ARE ALWAYS USING YOUR LOWER MOTOR NEOR ONS TO MOVE MUSCLE SO WE CAN REALLY SIMPLIFY THINGS NOW IF GIVING YOU A LOT OF IN FORMATION BUT WE CAN SIMPLIFY IT BASICALLY OPEN LOOPER CLOTHES LOUP THAT'S ONE QUESTION AND WHAT AM I GET A FOCUS ON AND THEN YOURE NOROLOGY WILL TAKE CARE OF THE REST SO NOW I WANT TO TALK ABOUT REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS SOMEWHERE IN HOLYWOOD PRESUMABLY IT GOT IN BEDDED IN SOMEBODY'S MIND THAT INSTANT SKILL ACQUISITION WAS POSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD TAKE A PARTICULAR PILL OR YOU COULD TOUCH A PARTICULAR OBJECT OR YOU COULD HAVE A WAND WAVE OVER YOU AND YOU WOULD SUDDENLY HAVE A SKILL AND SO THAT IS THE RESULT OF HOLLYWOOD AT ALL IT DOESN'T EXIST AT LEAST NOT IN REALITY AND I LOVE MOVIES BUT IT SIMPLY DOESN'T EXIST THEN THE SELF HELP LITERATURE CREATED ANOTHER RULE CALLED THE TEN THOUSAND HOURS RULE AND FRANKLY THAT DOESN'T REALLY MATCH THE LITERATURE AT LEAST THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE EITHER I LIKE IT BECAUSE IT IMPLIES THAT LEARNING TAKES TIME WHICH IS MORE ACCURATE THAN THE HOLLYWOOD AT ALL INSTANT SKILL ACQUISITION RULE WHICH ISN'T REALLY A RULE IT'S A MYTH BUT THE TEN THOUSAND HOURS RULE OVERLOOK SOMETHING CRUCIAL WHICH IS THAT IT'S NOT ABOUT OURS IT'S ABOUT REPETITIONS NOW OF COURSE THERE'S A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TIME AND REPETITIONS BUT THERE ARE SOME BEAUTIFUL EXPERIMENTS THAT POINT TO THE FACT THAT BY SIMPLE ADJUSTMENT OF WHAT YOU ARE FOCUSED ON AS YOU ATTEMPT TO LEARN A NEW SKILL YOU CAN ADJUST THE NUMBER OF REPETITIONS THAT YOU DO YOU ADJUST YOUR MODIVATION FOR LEARNING AND YOU CAN VASTLY EXCELERATE LEARNING SOME OF YOU MAY RECOGNIZE THIS BY ITS INTERNET NAME WHICH IS NOT A SCIENTIFIC TERM WHICH IS THE SUPERMARIO EFFECT THERE'S ECHALY A QUITE GOOD VIDIO ON YOU TO DESCRIBING THE SUPERMARIO FACT I THINK IT WAS A UTUBER WHO HAS A THINK ABACKGROUND IN SCIENCE AND HE DID AN INTERESTING EXPERIMENT AND I'LL TALK ABOUT HIS EXPERIMENT FIRST AND THEN I WILL TALK ABOUT THE NEUROBIOLOGY THAT SUPPORTS THE RESULT THAT HE GOT THE SUPERMARIO EFFECT RELATES TO THE GAMES SUPERMARIO BROTHERS BUT YOU'LL SEE WHY AT THE END BUT BASICALLY WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY HAD FIFTY THOUSAND SUBJECTS WHICH IS A ENORMOUS NUMBER OF SUBJECTS LEARN A PROGRAMME ESSENTIALY TAKING WORDS FROM A COMPUTER PROGRAME WORK I THE COMMANDS FOR A COMPUTE PROGRAME THAT WERE KIND OF CLUSTERED IN A COLUMN ON THE RIGHT SO THESE ARE THE SORTS OF THINGS THAT COMPUTER PROGRAMMES WILL BE FAMILIAR WITH BUT OTHER PEOPLE WON'T AND THOSE COMMANDS ARE ESSENTIALLY THEY SENTIALLY TRANSLATE TO THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW GO FORWARD AND THEN IF IT'S A RIGHT HAND TURN IN THE MAZE THAN GO RIGHT AND A CONTINUE UNTIL YOU HIT A CHOICE POINT ET CETERA SO IT'S A BUNCH OF INSTRUCTIONS BUT THE JOB OF THE SUBJECTS IN THESE EXPERIMENTS WERE TO ORGANIZE THOSE INSTRUCTIONS IN A PARTICULAR WAY THAT WOULD ALLOW A LITTLE CURSER TO MOVE THROUGH THE MAZE SUCCESSFULLY OK SO BASICALLY THE GOAL WAS OR AT LEAST WHAT THE SUBJECTS WERE TOLD IS THAT ANY ONE CAN LEARN TO COMPUTER PROGRAMME AND IF SOMEBODY CAN JUST ORGANIZE THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE RIGHT WAY THEN THEY CAN PROGRAMM THIS LITTLE CURSER TO MOVE THROUGH A MAZE VERY SIMPLE AND YET IF YOU DON'T HAVERY BACKGROUND IN COMPUTER PROGRAMMING OR EVEN IF YOU DO IT TAKES THEM SKILL YEVT TO KNOW WHAT COMMANDS TO GIVE IN WHAT PARTICULAR ORDER AND THEY MADE THAT VERY EASY YOUASSEMBLE THEM IN THE LIST OVER ON TO THE RIGHT SO PEOPLE STARTED DOING THIS NOW THERE WERE TWO GROUPS AND SOME ONE HALF OF THE SUBJECTS IF THEY GOT IT WRONG MEANING THEY ENTERED A COMMAND AND THE CURSER WOULD MOVE AND IT WAS THE WRONG COMMAND FOR THIS LITTLE CURSEDO MOVE THROUGH THE MAZE THEY SAW A SIGNAL JUMP UP ON THEIR SCREEN THAT SAID THAT DID NOT WORK PLEASE TRY AGAIN SO IF THEY GOT THEY PUT IN THE WRONG COMMANDERS AND THE WRONG SEQUENCES SAY THAT DID NOT WORK PLEASE TRY AGAIN AND THAN THE PEOPLE WOULD AT THE SUBJECTS WOULD REORGANIZE THE INSTRUCTIONS THAN THEN THE LOCURSER WOULD CONTINUE AND IF THEY GOT T WRONG AGAIN IT WULD SAY THAT DID NOT WORK PLEASE TRY AGAIN ONKI THE OTHER HALF OF THE SUBJECTS IF THEY GOT SOMETHING WRONG WERE TOLD YOU JUST LOST FIVE POINTS PLEASE CONTINUE SO THAT'S THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN THE FEED BACK THAT THEY GOT NOW I HAVE TO CONFESS I WOULD HAVE PREDICTED BASED ON MY KNOWLEDGE OF DOPAMEN CIRCUITRY AND REWARD CONTINGENCY AND AT THE NEFEREND AND STRESS AND MOTIVATED LEARNING AND THIS OTHER THING THAT WE'VE BEEN TOLD IN MANY MANY BOOKS ON BEHAVIORL ECONOMICS AND IN THE SELF HELP LITERATURE WHICH IS THAT PEOPLE WIL WORK MUCH HARDER TO PREVENT LOSING SOMETHING THAN THEY WILL TO GAIN SOMETHING THAT YOU HEAR ALL THE TIME AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THAT'S NOT AT ALL WHAT HAPPENED IF THEY LOOKED AT THE SUCCESS RATE OF THE SUBJECTS WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT THESE SUBJECTS THAT WERE TOLD THAT DID NOT WORK PLEASE TRY AGAIND HAD A SIXTY EIGHT PER CENT SUCCESS RATE SIXTY EIGHT PER CENT OF THEM WENT ON TO SUCCESSFULLY PROGRAMM THIS CURSE AR MOVING THROUGH THE MAZE WHEREAS THE ONES THAT WERE TOLD YOU LOST FIVE POINTS HAD A FIFTY TWO PER CENT SUCCESSRATE WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENTS BUT THE SOURCE OF THE SUCCESS OR THE LACK OF SUCCESS IS REALLY INTERESTING THE SUBJECTS THAT WERE TOLD THAT DID NOT WORK PLEASE TRY AGAIN TRIED MANY MANY MORE TIMES PER UNIT TIME IN OTHER WORDS THEY MADE MORE ATTEMPTS AT PROGRAMMING THIS THING TO ALLOW THIS CURSON REMOVE THROUGH THE MAZE WHEREAS THE PEOPLE THAT WERE TOLD YOU LOST FIVE POINTS GAVE UP EARLIER OR GAVE UP ENTIRELY OK LET'S JUST STEP BACK FROM THIS BECAUSE TO ME THIS WAS VERY SURPRISING IT VIOLATES A LOT OF THINGS THAT I HAD HEARD IN THE KOND OF POPULAR CULTURE OR THE SEL HELP LITERATURE THAT PEOPLE WILL WORK MUCH HARDER TO AVOID LOSING SOMETHING THAN THEY WILL TO GAIN SOMETHING AND IT DIDN'T REALLY FIT WITH WHAT I UNDERSTOOD ABOUT REWARD CONTINGENCIES INDOPAMY BUT IT DID FIT WELL WITH ANOTHER SET OF EXPERIMENTS THAT A VERY FAMILIAR WITH FROM THE NARROW SCIENCE LATERATURE ND I'LL GIVE YOU THE PUNCH LINE FIRST AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO TAKE WHAT THESE DATEAMEAN AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT A LEARNING PROTOCAL THAT YOU CAN USE THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO LEARN SKILLS FASTER BY WILLINGLY PARTICIPATING IN MORE REPETITIONS OF THE SKILL LEARNING MEANING YOU WILL WANT TO DO MORE REPETITIONS EVEN IF YOU'RE GETTING IT WRONG SOME OR MOST OF THE TIME SO THE EXPERIMENT THAT I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT IS CALLED THE TUBE TEST AND THIS IS GENERALLY DONE IN MICE ALTHOUGH IT SOMETIMES BEEN DONE IN RATS AND HAS A LOT OF PARALLELS TO SOMETHINGS THAT YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN AND EXPERIENCE EVEN IN HUMAN LIFE IN REGULAR LIFE MAY BEVEN IN YOUR LIFE SO HERS THE EXPERIMENT YOU TAKE TWO RATS YOU PUT HIM IN A TUBE OR TWO MICE PUT HIM IN A TUBE AND MICE AND RATS THEY DON'T LIKE TO SHARE THE SAME TUBE SO WHAT THE'LL DO AS THEYLL START PUSHING EACH OTHER BACK AND FORTH BACK AND FORTH SOONER OR LATER ONE OF THE RATS OR MICE PUSHES THE OTHER ONE OUT THE ONE THEY GOT PUSHED OUT IS THE LOSER THE ONE THAT GETS THE TUBE IS THE WINNER OQE NOW YOU TAKE THE WINNER YOU GIVE IT A NEW COMPETITOR AND WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT THE MOUSE OR RAT THAT ONE PREVIOUSLY HAS THEY MUCH HIGHER THAN CHANCE PROBABILITY OF WINNING THE SECOND TIME IN OTHER WORDS WINNING BEFORE LEADS TO WINNING AGAIN AD THE REVERSE IS ALSO TRUE IF YOU TAKE THE LOSER AND YOU PUT THAT LOSER IN WITH ANOTHER MOUSE FRESH MOUSE NEW MOUSE THE LOSER TYPICALLY WILL LOSE AT MUCH GREATER PROBABILITY THAN CHANCE AND THIS IS NOT RELATED TO DIFFERENCES IN STRENGTH OR SIZE OR TESTASTRONE OR ANY OTHER THE THINGS THAT MIGHT LEAP TO MIND AS EXPLANATIONS FOR THIS BECAUSE THOSE WERE ALL CONTROLLED FORTH NOW THAT RESULT HAVE BEEN KNOWN ABOUT FOR DECADES BUT THREE YEARS AGO THERE WAS A PAPER PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL SCIENCE PHENOMENAL JOURNAL TO ONE OF THE THREE APEX JOURNALS THAT EXAMINED THE BRAIN AREA THAT'S INVOLVED IN THIS TURNS OUTS OF PARTICULAR AREA THE FRONTAL QUARTEX FOR THOSE OF VIOU THAT WANT TO KNOW AND THEY DID A SIMPLE EXPERIMENT WHERE THEY THE EXPERIMENTERS INCREASED OR DECREASED THE ACTIVITY OF THIS BRAIN AREA IN THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEXLAL SUBREGION OF THE PREFONTAL QUARTEX AND WHAT THEY FOUND IS IF THEY STIMULATED THIS BRAIN AREA A MOUSE OR RAT REGARDLESS OF WEATHER R NOT IT HAD BEEN A WINNER OR LOSER BEFORE BECAME A WINNER EVERY SINGLE TIME AND THEY SHOWED THAT IF THEY BLOCKED THE ACTIVITY OF THIS BRAIN AREA REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT THE MOUSE AR RAT HAD BEEN A WINNER OR A LOSER IT BECAME A LOSER EVERY SINGLE TIME AND THIS TRANSLATED TO OTHER SENAREOS OTHER COMPETITIVE SENAREOS WHERE THEY PUT A BUNCH OF MICE OR RATS IN A CUT NA COOL CHAMBER THEY'D HAVE A LITTLE HEAT LA P IN THE CORNER AND MICE LIKE HEAT AND THERE WAS ONLY ENOUGH SPACE FOR ONE MOUTHS TO GET THE BE UNDER THE HEAT AND THE ONE THAT HAD ONE IN THE TUBE TEST OR THAT HAVE THE VRANARIO STIMULATED ALWAYS GOT THAN NICE WARM SPOT CSO WHAT IS THIS MAGIC BRAIN AREA WHAT IS IT DOING WELL THE REASON I BRINGIN THIS UP TO DAY AND THE REASON I'M BRINGING IT UP ON THE HEELS OF THE SUPERMARIO EFFECT IS THAT STIMULATION OF THIS BRAIN AREA HAD A VERY SIMPLE AND VERY IMPORTANT EFFECT WHICH WAS IT LED TO MORE FORWARD STEPS MORE REPETITIONS MORE EFFORT BUT NOT IN TERMS OF SHEER MIGHT AND WILL NOT DIGGING DEEPER JUST MORE REPETITIONS PER UNIT TIME AND THE LOSERS HAD FEWER REPETITIONS PER UNIT TIME SO THE SUPERMARIO EFFECT THIS ONLINE EXPERIMENT AND THE TUBE TEST WHICH HAS BEEN DONE BY VARIOUS LABS AND REPEATED AGAIN AND AGAIN POINT TO A SIMPLE BUT VERY IMPORTANT RULE WHICH IS NEITHER THE TEN THOUSAND HOURS RULE NOR THE MAGIC WAND HOLLYWOOD VERSION OF LEARNING BUT RATHER THE NEROBIOLOGICAL EXPLANATION FOR LEARNING A SKILL IS YOU WANT TO PERFORM AS MANY REPETITIONS PER UNIT TIME AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN AT LEAST WHEN YOU'RE FIRST TRYING TO LEARN A SKILL I ONT A REPEAT THAT YOU WANT O PERFORM AS MANY REPETITIONS AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN AT LEAST WHEN YOU'RE FIRST TRYING TO LEARN A SKILL NOW THAT MIGHT SOUND LIKE A DO IS JUST MORE REPS BUT IT'S NOT SO OBVIOUS THERE'S NO REASON WHY MORE REPETITIONS SHOULD NECESSARILY LEAD TO FASTER LEARNING BECAUSE YOU COULD ALSO SAY WHEN MORE REPETITIONS YOU CAN MAKE MORE ERRORS AND THOSE ERRORS WOULD LEAD TO POOR PERFORMANCE LIKE MISSTEPPING A NUMBER OF TIMES AND IN THESE CASES THERE'S THERE'S VERY LITTLE FEET BACK RIGHT IT'S NOT LIKE EVERY TIME AH THE THE RAT PUSHES FORWARD OR MOVES BACK THAT IT IS SENSING OH I'M WINNING I'M LOSING I'M WINNG I'M LOSING ON A MICRO LEVEL IT PROBABLY DOES THAT AS IT STARTS TO PUSH THE OTHER ONE OUT THE RAT OR MOUTHE PROBABLY THINGS I'M WINNING AND AS IT'S BACKING UP ITS PLY THINGS I'M LOSING AS YOU PLAY THE GAME THE SUPERMARIO GAME YOU ARE TOLD NOPE THAT DIDN'T WORK NOPE THAT DIDN'T WORK PLEASE TRY AGAIN BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT THE WINNERS ARE ALWAYSE GENERATING MORE REPETITIONS PER UNIT TIME IT'S JUST A REPEAT OF PERFORMANCE REPEAT OF PERFORMANCE EVEN IF THERE ARE ERRORS AND THAT POINTS TO SOMETHING VITALLY IMPORTANT WHICH IS REPS ARE IMPORTANT BUT MAKING ERROR RPS IS ALSO IMPORTANT IN FACT IT MIGHT BE THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR SO LET'S TALK ABOUT ERRORS AND WHY THOSE SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF WHAT TO FOCUS ON BECAUSE AS IS SAID EARLIER IF YOU WANT TO LEARN SOMETHING YOU NEED TO KNOW OF ITS OPEN LUPERCLOTHE LOOP AND YOU NEED TO NOW WHAT TO FOCUS ON WHERE TO PLACE YOUR PERCEPTION AND THAT SEEMS LIKE A TOUGH TASK BUT ERRORS WILL TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT TO FOCUS ON SO LET'S TALK ABOUT ERRORS AND WHY YOU CAN LEVERAGE ERRORS TO ECCELERATE SKILL LEARNING OCAST WE'VE ESTABLISHED THAT PERFORMING THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF REPETITIONS PER TRAINING SESTION IS GOING TO BE ADVANTAGEOUS AND THAT MIGHT SEEM OBVIOUS BUT THERE'S A SHADOWY SIDE TO THAT WHICH IS WELL WHY WOULD I WANTED JUST REPEAT THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN IF I'M GETTING IT WRONG NINETY PER CENT OF THE TIME AND THE REASON IS THAT THE ERRORS ACTUALLY CU YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM TO TWO THINGS ONE TO ERROR CORRECTION AND THE OTHER IS IT OPENS THE DOOR OR THE WINDOW FOR NERROW PLASTICITY NER PLASTICITY IS THE BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEMS ABILITY TO CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO EXPERIENCE ESSENTIALLY TO CUSTOM MODIFY ITSELF IN ORDER TO PERFORM ANYTHING BETTER WE DIDN'T ENTIRE MONTH ONNERROW PLASTICITY AND I TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ERRORS AND WHY THEY ARE IMPORTANT NOW WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THIS VERY CONCRETE AND OPERATIONALIZE IT MAKE IT VERY ACTIONABLE THRE WAS A PAPER THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE FROM NORMAN AT ALL THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PAPER IT WAS PUBLISHING THE JOURNAL NURON WHICH IS A SELL PRESS JOURNAL EXCELLENT JOURNAL THE TITLE OF THE PAPER GIVES IP GIVES IT AWAY ESSENTIALLY WHICH IS POST ERROR RECRUITMENT OF FRONTAL CENSORY CUARTICAL PROJECTIONS PROMOTES ATTENTION NOW WHAT THAT SAYS IS THAT WHEN YOU MAKE AN ERROR IT CAUSES AND ACTIVATION OF THE BRAIN AREAS THAT ANCHOR YOUR ATTENTION REMEMBER WE NEED PERCEPTION ATTENTION WHICH ARE THEIRE SENTUALLY THE SAME THING WE NEED PROPRIACEPTION AND WE NEED THE UPPER AND LOWER MOTOR NONS TO COMMUNICATE IN THE PROPER WAYS AND THIS VITAL QUESTION IS WHAT TO PAY ATTENTION TO ERRORS TELL YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT SOMETHING NEEDS TO CHANGE SO IF YOU ARE PERFORMING A TASK OR A SKILL LIKE YOUR LEARNING HOW TO DANCE AND YOUR STEPPING ON THE OTHER PERSONS TOES OR YOUR FUMBLING OR YOUR NOT GETTING IT RIGHT THOSE ERRORS ARE OPENING THE POSSIBILITY FOR PLASTICITY IF YOU WALK AWAY AT THAT POINT YOU'VE MADE THE EXACT WRONG CHOICE OCA UNLESS THE ERRORS ARE SOMEHOW HAZARDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH OR SOMEBODY ELSE'S WELL BEING YOU WANT TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE AT A HIGH REPETITION RATE THAT'S REALLY WHERE THE LEARNING IS POSSIBLE WITHOUT ERRORS THE BRAIN IS NOT IN A POSITION TO CHANGE ITSELF ERRORS ACTUALLY CUE THE FRONTAL QUARTEC NETWORKS WHAT WE CALL TOP DOWN PROCESSING AND THE NERROW MODULATORS THINGS LIKE DOPOMEN IN A SETO COLING AN EPINEFERON THAT WILL ALLOW FOR PLASTICITY SO WHILE THE SUPERMARIO EXPERIMENT THE MAZE EXPERIMENT WAS ONLY FOCUSED ON GENERATING ERRORS TELLING PEOPLE THAT WASN'T RIGHT PLEASE TRY AGAIN OR THAT WASN'T RIGHT YOU LOST FIVE POINTS THE KEY DISTINCTION IS THAT THE ERRORS THEMSELVES CUED PEOPLE TO THE FACT THAT THEY NEEDED TO CHANGE SOMETHING SO IF YOU'RE TRYING TO LEARN A NEW SKILL AND YOUR SCREWING UP IN YOUR MAKING MISTAKES THE MORE MISTAKES YOU MAKE THE MORE P LASTIC YOUR BRAIN BECOMES SUCH THAT WHEN YOU GET IT RIGHT THAT CORRECT PATTERN WILL BE REWARDED AND CONSOLIDATED AND YOU CAN TRUST THAT IT WILL BECAUSE THE PERFORMANCE OF SOMETHING CORRECTLY IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RELEASE OF THIS NORMODULATOR DOPAMIE DOPAMINE IS INVOLVED IN CRAVING AND MOTIVATION 'SINVOLVED IN A LOT OF THINGS BUT IT'S ALSO INVOLVED IN LEARNING WE WILL DO AN ENTIRE EPISODE ON DOPAMINE AND LEARNING BUT BECAUSE SOME OF YOUARE PROBABLY WONDERING THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT JUST INCREASING YOUR DOPAMINE LEVELS BEFORE LEARNING WILL ALLOW YOU TO LEARN FASTER IN FACT INCREASING YOUR DOPAMINE LEVELS BEFORE LEARNING USING FARMA COLOGY WILL ACTUALLY REDUCE WHAT'S CALLED THE SIGNAL TO NOISE IT WILL MAKE THESE INCREASES IN DOPAMINE THAT POP UP IN YOUR BRAIN THAT SUDDENLY MAKE YOURELIZE AH I GOT THAT ONE RIGHT IT WILL MAKE THOSE SMALLER RELATIVE TO THE BACKROUND LEVELS OF DOPAMINE OK YOU WANT A BIG SPIKE IN DOPAMINE WHEN YOU PERFORM A MOTOR PATTERN CORRECTLY AND YOU WANT TO MAKE LOTS OF ERRORS MANY MANY REPETITIONS OF ERRORS IN ORDER TO GET TO THAT CORRECT PERFORMANCE NOW IF YOU'RE LIKE MOST PEOPLE YOU'RE GOING TO DO THIS IN A WAY THAT'S SOMEWHAT RANDOM MEANING LET SAY IT'S A TENNIS SERVE I CAN'T PLAY TENNIS I'VE I THINK I'VE PROBABLY PLAYED TENNIS TWICE SO IF I THROW THE BALL UP IN THE AIR AND HID IT A MN IT GET IT WRONG AND PRO HIT THE NET THAN HIT THE NET THEN I'LL PRI GO TOO LONG THAN  PI E GOVER THE FENCE AT SOME POINT I LIKE TO THINK I'LL GET IT CORRECT THE DOPAMINE SIGNAL FOR THAT IS GOING TO BE QUITE BIG AND I'LL THINK OK WHAT DID I DO THERE I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW I WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION WHAT I WAS PAYING ATTENTION TO IS WHETHER NOT THE BALL WHENT TO THE CORRECT LOCATION ON THE OPPOSITSIE THE NET REMEMBERS AN OPEN LOOP MOVE SO I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT I DID CORRECTLY BUT YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM WILL TAKE CARE OF THAT PROVIDED I IN THIS CASE COMPLETE MORE AND MORE AND MORE REPETITIONS NOW IF I WERE TO JUST ELEVATE MY BAS A LEVEL OF DOPMINE BY TAKING IDON'KNO FIFTEEN HUNDRE MILEGRAMS OF TIRE ELL TIROSINE OR SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE BAD BECAUSE THE INCREAS IN DOPAMINE WOULD ACTUALLY BE MUCH LOWER RIGHT THE WE WOULD SAY THE DELTAS SMALLER THE SIGNAL THE NOISE IS SMALLER IF MY OVERALL LEVELS OF DOPAMINE ARE VERY VERY HIGH SO A MASHIGANL LEARN LESS WELL SO FOR SKILL LEARNING MOTOR SKILL LEARNING INCREASING YOUR DOPAMINE LEVELS PRIOR IS NOT A GOOD IDEA IT MIGHT HELP WITH MOTIVATION TO GET TO THE LEARNING BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO IMPROVE THE PLASTICITY PRACESS ITSELF AND IT'S LIKELY TO HINDER IT AS SO THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT SO THESE ERRORS CUE THE BRAIN THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG AND THEY OPEN UP THE POSSIBILITY FOR PLASTICITY IT'S WHAT SOMETIMES CALLED THE FRAMING EFFECT IT FRAMES WHAT'S IMPORTANT AND SO I THINK THIS IS A A SHIFT AT WE'VE HERE IT ABOUT YOU KNOW GROWTH MIND SET WHICH IS THE INCREDIBLE DISCOVERY AND THEORY AND PRACTICE OF MY COLLY CARROLL TO I COULD STAMFORD THIS IS DISTINCT FROM THAT RIGHT THIS ISN'T ABOUT A MOTIVATION TO LEARN THIS IS ABOUT HOW YOU ACTUALLY LEARN SO THE KEY IS DESIGNATE A PARTICULAR BLOCK OF TIME THAT YOU ARE GOING TO PERFORM REPETITIONS SO MAYBE THAT'S THIRTY MINUTES MAY BE THAT'S AN HOUR WORK FOR TIME AND THEN TRY AND PERFORM THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF REPETITIONS THAT YOU CAN DO SAFELY FOR YOU AND OTHERS PERUNIT TIME THAT'S GOING TO BE THE BEST WAY TO APPROACH LEARNING FOR MOST SESSIONS I'LL TALK ABOUT OTHER THINGS THAT ONE CAN DO BUT MAKING ERRORS IS KEY AND THIS ISN'T A MOTIVATIONAL SPEECH ARE NOT SAYING OH GO MAKE ERRORS ERRS ARE GOOD FOR YOU YOU HAVE TO FAIL IN ORDER TO WIN NO YOU HAVE TO FAIL IN ORDER TO OPEN UP THE POSSIBILITY OF PLASTICITY BUT YOU HAVE TO FAIL MANY TIMES WITHIN THE SAME SESSION AND THOSE FAILURES WILL CUE YOUR ATTENTION TO THE APPROPRIATE SENSORY EVENTS NOW SOMETIMES WE'RE WORKING WITH A COACH AND SO THIS IS A SHOUT OUT TO ALL THE COACHES THANK YOU FOR DOING WHAT YOU DO HOWEVER THERE NEEDS TO BE AT LEAST WHAT THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE SAY THERE NEEDS TO BE A PERIOD OF EACH TRAINING SESSION WHEREBY THE ATHLETE OR THE PERSON OF ANY KIND CAN SIMPLY PAY ATTENTION TO THEIR ERRORS WITHOUT THEIR ATTENTION BEING CUED TO SOMETHING ELSE UT REALLY WELL TRAINED COACH WILL SAY OH YOU KNOW YOUR ELBOWS SWINGING TO HIGH OR YOUR YOU'RE NOT GRIPPING THE RACKET IN THE APPROPRIATE WAY ET CETERA THEY CAN SEE THINGS THAT THE PRACTITION OR CAN'T SEE AND OF COURSE THAT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT BUT THE PRACTITIONER ALSO NEEDS TO USE THIS ERROR RECOGNITION SIGNAL THEY NEED TO BASICALLY FOCUS ON SOMETHING AND THE ERRORS ARE GOING TO TELL THEM WHAT TO FOCUS ON SO PUT SIMPLY THERE NEEDS TO BE A PERIOD OF TIME IN WHICH IS JUST REPETITION AFTER REPETITION AFTER REPETITION I THINK MANY PEOPLE INCLUDING COACHES ARE AFRAID THAT BAD HABITS WILL GET IN GRAINED AND WHILE INDEED THAT'S POSSIBLE IT'S VERY IMPORTING THAT THESE ERRORS OCCUR IN ORDER TO CUE THE ATTENTIONAL SYSTEMS AND TO OPEN THE DOOR FOR PLASTICITY SO IF I'M TOLD LOOK AT YOU KNO I'M STANDING A LITTLE WIDE I NEED TO TIGHTEN UP MY STANCE A LITTLE BIT GREAT BUT THEN I NEED TO GENERATE MANY REPETITIONS FROM THAT TIGHTEN STANTS OCASO IF I'M CONSTANTLY BEING CUED FROM THE OUTSIDE ABOUT WHAT I'M DOING IN CORRECTLY THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE AS EFFICIENT OCHESO FOR SOME PEOPLE THESE LEARNING SESSIONS MIGHT BE TEN MINUTES FOR SOME PEOPLE IT MIGHT BE AN HOUR WHATEVER YOU CAN ALOCATE BECAUSE YOUR LIE STYLES WILL VARY IN YOUR WETHER NOT YOUR PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE ET CETERA WILL VARY YOU WANT TO GET THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF REPETITIONS AN AND YOU WANT TO MAKE ERRORS THAT'S ALLOWING FOR PLASTICITY SO SCIENCE POINTS TO THE FACT THAT THERE'S A PARTICULAR SEQUINCING OF LEARNING SESSIONS THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO LEARN FASTER AND TO RETAIN THE SKILL LEARNING AT INVOLVES DOING EXACTLY AS I JUST DESCRIBED WHICH IS GETTING AS MANY REPETITIONS AS YOU CAN IN THE LEARNING SESSION PAYING ATTENTION TO THE ERRORS THAT YOU MAKE AND THEN THE REWARDS THAT WILL BE GENERATED AGAIN THESE ARE NURROW CHEMICAL REWARDS FROM THE SUCCESSFUL PERFORMANCE OF A MOVEMENT OR THE APPROXIMATE SUCCESSFUL PERFORMANCE SO MAYBE YOU GET THE GULFSWING BETTER BUT NOT PERFECT BUT THAT STILL GOING TO BE REWARDED WITH THIS NOR CHEMICAL MECHANISM AND THEN AFTER THE SESSION YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING VERY SPECIFIC WHICH IS NOTHING HIT'S RIGHT THERE ARE BEAUTIFUL DATA DESCRIBING NURONS IN OUR HYPOCAMPUS THIS ARRY OF OUR BRAIN INVOLVED IN THE CONSOLIDATION OF NEW MEMORIES THOSE DATE A POINT TO THE FACT THAT IN SLEEP THERE'S A REPLAY OF THE SEQUENCE OF NURANS THAT WERE INVOLVED ON CERTAIN BEHAVIORS THE PREVIOUS DAY AND SOMETIMES THE PREVIOUS DAY BEFORE THAT HOWEVER THERE ARE ALSO DATA THAT SHOW THAT AFTER A SKILL LEARNING SESSION ANY KIND OF MOTOR MOVEMENT PROVIDED YOU ARE NOT BRINGING IN A LOT MORE ADDITIONAL NEW CENSORY STIMULAN THERE'S A REPLAY OF THE MOTOR SEQUENCE THAT YOU PERFORMED CORRECTLY AND THERE'S AN ELIMINATION OF THE MOTOR SEQUENCES THAT YOU PERFORMED INCORRECKLY AND THEY ARE RUN BACKWARD IN TIME OKI SO TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THIS IF I WERE TO LEARN A NEW SKILL OR NAVIGATE A NEW CITY OR LET U STAY WITH THA THE MOTOR SKILL LET SAY THAT THE FREETHROW OR A GULL SWING OR A TENNISS SERVE DANCE MOVE NOVICE SO I'M STILL IN T MAKE A LOT ERRORS DON'T GET IT PERFECTLY IN MAYBE I GET A LITTLE BIT BETTER OR I PERFORM IT CORRECTLY THREETIMES OUT OF A THOUSAND THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING I MIGHT DO AND THERE A 'M PROBABLY BEING GENEROUS TO MYSELF AFTER I FINISH THE TRAINING SESSION IF I DO NOTHING I'M NOT FOCUSSED ON SOME ADDITIONAL LEARNING I'M NOT BRINGING A LOT OF CENSORY INFORMATION IN IF I JUST SIT THERE AND CLOSE MY EYES FOR FIVE TO TEN MINUTES EVEN ONE MINUTE THE BRAIN STARTS TO REPLAY THE MOTOR SEQUENCE OF THE CORCORRESPONDING TO THE CORRECT PATTERN OF MOVEMENT BUT IT PLAYS THAT SEQUENCE BACKWARD NOW WHY IT PLAYS IT BACKWARD WE DON'T KNOW IF I WERE TO WAIT UNTIL SLEEP OR REGARDLESS WHEN I SLEEP LATER THAT NIGHT THE SEQUENCE WILL REBE REPLAYED FORWARDS IN THE PROPER SEQUENCE IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARD IT'S PLAYED BACKWARD FOR REASONS THAT ARE STILL UNCLEAR BUT THE REPLAY OF THAT SEQUENCE BACKWARDS APPEARS TO BE IMPORTANT FOR THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE SKILL LEARNING NOW THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE ARE FINISHING THEIR JUGITZU CLASS OR THEY'RE FINISHING THEIR YOGA CLSS OR THEY'RE FINISHING THEIR DANCE CLASS OR THEY'RE FINISHING SOME SKILL LEARNING AND THEN THEYRE IMMEDIATELY DEVOTING THEIR ATTENTION TO SOMETHING ELSE YOU HEARE A LOT ABOUT VISUALIZATION AND WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT VISUALIZATION BUT IN THE KIND OF OBSESSION WITH THE IDEA THAT WE CAN LEARN THINGS JUST SITTING THERE WITH OUR EYES CLOSED WITHOUT HAVE ING TO PERFORM A MOVEMENT WE'VE OVERLOOKED SOMETHING PERHAPS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT OR AT LEAST EQUALLY IMPORTANT WHICH IS AFTER SKILL LEARNING AFTER PUTTING EFFORT INTO SOMETHING SITTING QUIETLY WITH THE EYES CLOSED FOR ONE TO FIVE TO TEN MINUTES ALLOWS THE BRAIN TO REPLAY THE SEQUENCS IN A WAY THAT APPEARS IMPORTANT FOR THE MORE RAPID CONSOLIDATION OF THE MOTOR SEQUENCE OF THE PATTERN AND TO ACCELERATED LEARNING IF YOU'D LIKE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS THIS IS NOT WORK THAT I WAS INVOLVED IN I WNT TO BE VERY CLEAR THERE'S AN EXCELLENT PAPER THAT COVERS THIS AND MUCH MORE FOR THOSE WETHER REALLY WANT TO DIVE DEEP ON THIS AND WE WILL DIVE DEEPER IN A MOMENT THIS IS A REVIEW THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL NURON EXCELLENT JOURNAL MANY OF THE PAPERS THAT AM REFERRING TO WERE COVERED IN THE IN THIS REVIEW WHICH IS TITLED NEURROW PLASTICITY SUBSERVING MOTOR SKILL LEARNING BY DION D A WY A N I HOPE O'F NOT BUTTERING THE PRONUNCIATION AND COEN BY LEONARD COEN BUT NOT HE NOT THE LEONARD COEN MOST OF US ARE FAMILIAR WITH ON THE MUSICIAN A LEONARD COEN DION IN COEN NERRO PLASTICITY SUBSERVING MOTOR SKILL LEARNING AND THIS WAS PUBLISHED A IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN BUT THERE' BEEN A NUMBER OF UPDATES AND THE LITERATURE THAT I'VE DESCRIBED IN OTHER PORTIONS OF TODAY'S EPISODE COME FROM THE MORE RECENT LITERATURE SUCH AS THE MORE RECENT TWENTY TWENTY ONE PAPER OQE SO YOAVE THIS BASIC LEARNING SESSION AND THEN A PERIOD OF TIME AFTERWARDS IN WHICH THE BRAIN CAN REHEARSE WHAT IT JUST DID WE HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT MENTAL REHEARSAL AND WE ALWAYS THINK ABOUT MENTO REHEARSAL AS THE THING YOU DO BEFOR YOU YOU TRAIN OR INSTEAD OF TRAINING BUT THIS IS REHEARSAL THAT'S DONE AFTERWARD WHERE THE BRAIN IS JUST AUTOMATICALLY SCRIPTING THROUGH THE SEQUENCE AND FOR SOME REASON THAT STILL NOT CLEAR AS TO WHY IT THIS WOULD BE THE CASE IT RUNS BACKWARD THAN IN SLEEP IT RUNS FORWARDS AND CERTAINLY ABSOLUTELY SLEEP AND QUALITY SLEEP OF THE APPROPRIATE DURATION ET CETERA AS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT FOR LEARNING OF ALL KINDS INCLUDING SKILL LEARNING WE DIDN'T ENTIRE FOUR EPISODES ON SLEEP AND HOW TO GET BETTER T SLEEPING THOSE WORE THET EPISODES BACK IN JANUARY EPISODES A SENTUALLY ONE TO THREE IN FOR AND MAYBE VEN EPISODE FIVE A DON'T RECALL BUT YOU CAN GO THERE TO FIND OUT ALL ABOUT HOW TO GET BETTER AT SLEEPING NOW THERE ARE OTHER TRAINING SESSIONS INVOLVED RIGHT I'M NOT KING A LEARN THE PERFECT GULF SWAYING OR THE TENNISSERVE OR HOW TO DANCE IN ONE SESSION AND I DOUBT YOU WILL EITHER SO THE QUESTION IS WHEN TO COME BACK AND WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU COME BACK TO THE TRAINING SESSION NOW FIRST OF ALL THIS PRINCIPLE OF ERRORS CUWING ATTENTION AND OPENING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PLASTICITY THAT'S NEVER GOING TO CHANGE THAT'S GOING TO BE TRUE FOR SOMEBODY WHOISE HYPER SKILLED WHOS EVEN A YOU KNOW HAS MASTERY OR EVEN VIRTUOSITY IN A GIVEN SKILL RIGHT REMEMBER WHEN YOU'RE UNSKILLED THAT SOMETHING UNCERTAINTY IS VERY HIGH AS YOU BECOME MORE SKILLED CERTAINTY GOES UP RIGHT THEN EVENTUAL YOU CHIEVE LEVELS OF MASTERY WERE CERTAINTY IS VERY VERY HIGH ABOUT YOUR ABILITY TO PERFORM YOURS CERTAINTY AND THAT OF OTHER PEOPLE A NHEN THERE'S THIS FORTH CATEGORY OF VIRTUOSITY WHERE SOMEBODY MAYBE YOU INVITES UNCERTAINTY BACK INTO THE PRACTICE BECAUSE ONLY WITH THAT UNCERTAINTY CAN YOU EXPRESS YOUR YOUR FULL RANGE OF OF ABILITIES WHICH YOU AREN'T EVEN AWARE OF UNTIL UNCERTAINTY COMES INTO THE PICTURE RIGHT I A HAPPEN TO A HAVE THE GREAT A PRIVILEGE OF OF BEING FRIENDS WITH LAIR HAMILTON THE BIGUAVESURFE IS PHENOMINAL I DON'T SERF A CERTAINLY DON'T SERF WITH LAIRD BUT HE AND AM YOU KNOW ANOTHER GUY THAT HE SERVES WITH LUCAPADUA THEIR THESE GUIS AR THEIR VIRTUOSOS AT SERFING THEY DON'T JUST WANT THE WAVE THAT THEY CAN MASTER THEY WANT UNCERTAINTY THEY'RE AT THE POINT IN THEIR PRACTICE WHERE WHEN UNCERTAINTY SHOWS UP LIKE A WAVE THAT EITHER SO BIG OR OM IS MOVING IN A PARTICULAR WAVE THAT IT BRINGS AN ELEMENT OF UNCERTAINTY FOR THEM ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO THAT THEY RECOGNIZE THAT IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PERFORM BETTER THAN THEY WOULD OTHERWISE OCAESA THEY'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO ELIMINATE UNCERTAINTY AT THE BEGINNING OF LEARNING ANY SKILL AND AS WE APPROACH FROM UNCERTAIN TO SKILLED TO MASTERY WE WANT A REDUCE UNCERTAINTY AND THAT'S REALLY WAT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IS DOING IT'S TRYING TO ELIMINATE ERRORS AND HONE IN ON THE CORRECT TRJECTORIES IF YOU PERFORM A LOT OF REPETITIONS AND THEN YOU USE A PERIOD IMMEDIATELY AFTER WE DON'T REALY HAVE A NAME FOR THIS MAY BE SOME ONE WILL COME UP WITH IT AND PUT IN THE COMMENT SECTION IF YOU'RE ON YOU TO HAVE YOU'RE WATCHING THIS ON YOU TOB A NAME FOR THIS POSTS LEARNING KIND OF IDLE TIME FOR THE BRAIN THE BRAIN IS AN IDLE AT ALL ATS ACTUALLY SCRIPTING ALL THESE THINGS IN REVERSE THAT ALLOW FOR DEEPER LEARNING AND MORE QUICK THER WERE QUICK LEARNING BUT IF WE FILL THAT TIME WITH OTHER THINGS IF WE ARE FOCUSED ON OUR PHONES OR WERE FOCUSSED ON LEARNING SOMETHING ELSE RE FOCUSSING ON OUR PERFORMANCE THAT'S NOT GOING TO SERVE US WELL ATS LEAST IS NOT CIN A SERVE THE SKILL LEARNING WELL SO PLEASE IF YOURE INTERESTED MORE RAPID SKILL LEARNING TRY INTRODUCING THESE SESSIONS THEY CAN BE QUITE POWERFUL AND THEN ON SUBSEQUENT SESSIONS PRESUMABLY AFTER A NIGHT SLEEP OR MAY BE AREDOING TWO SESSIONS A DAY ALTHOUGH TWO SESSIONS THE DAYS CAN BE A LOT FOR MOST PEOPLE UNLESS YOU ARE PROFESSIONAL OR AM YOU KNOW HIGH LEVEL ATHLETE THE SUBSEQUENT SESSIONS OR WHERE YOU GET TO EXPRESS THE GAINS OF THE PREVIOUS SESSION RIGHT WHERE YOU GET TO PERFORM WELL PRESUMABLY MORE OFTEN EVEN OF ITS JUSSUTTLE SOMETIMES THEY'LL BE A DECREASE IN PERFORMANCE BUT MOST OFTEN YOU'RE GOING TO PERFORM BETTER ON SUBSEQUENT AND SUBSEQUENT TRAINING SESSIONS AND THERE IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEVOTE ATTENTION IN VERY SPECIFIC WAYS RIGHT NOT JUST LET THE ERRORS INFORM YOU WERE TO PLACE YOUR ATTENTION BUT RATHER TO DIRECT YOUR PERCEPTION TO PARTICULAR ELEMENTS OF THE MOVEMENT IN ORDER TO ACCELERATE LEARNING FURTHER I SO TO BE VERY CLEAR CAUSE I KNOW MANY OF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN IN CONCRETE PROTOCALLS IT'S NOT JUST THAT YOU WOULD ONLY FOLK LET ERRORS CUE YOUR ATTENTION ON THE FIRST SESSION YOU MIGHT DO THAT FOR ONE SESSION OR FIVE SESSIONS ARE GOING TO DEPEND BUT ONCE YOUR FAMILIAR WITH SOMETHING IN YOUR PERFORMING IT WELL EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE YOU'R ACCOMPLISHING IT BETTER EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE THEN YOU CAN START TO CUIOR ATTENTION IN VERY DELIBERATE WAYS AND THE QUESTION THEREFORE BECOMES WHAT TO CUIOUR ATTENTION TO AND THE GOOD NEWS IS IT DOESN'T MATTER THERE IS A BEAUTIFUL SET OF EXPERIMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE LOOKING AT SEQUENCES OF KEYS BEING PLAYED ON A PIANO TIS WORK THAT WAS PUBLISHED AH JUST A COUPLE YEARS AGO THAR A SHE SEVERAL PAPERS NOW THAT ARE FOCUSSED ON THIS ONE OF THEM AH WAS PUBLISHIN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THIS IS FROM A CLAUDIA LAPE AND COLLEAGUES ELL A P P E  DONE SOME REALLY NICE WORK WHICH TALKS ABOUT THE THE INFLUENCE OF PITCH FEED BACK ON LEARNING OF MOTOR TIMING AND SEQUENCING AND THIS WAS DONE WITH PIANO BUT IT CARRIES OVER TO ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE AS WELL SOME ON TO DESCRIBE THE STUDY TO YOU BUT BEFORE I DESCRIBE IT WHAT IS SO INTERESTING ABOUT THIS STUDY THAT I WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT IS THAT IT TURNS OUT IT DOESN'T MATTER SO MUCH WHAT YOU PAY ATTENTION TO DURING THE LEARNING SEQUENCE PROVIDED AT SOMETHING RELATED TO THE MOTOR BEHAVIOR THAT YOUR PERFORMING RIGT THAT SEEMS INCREDIBLE RIGHT I'M NOT GOOD AT A TENNIS SIRE SO IF I'VE DONE YOU KNOW LET'S AY A THOUSAND REPETITIONS O THE TENNISSERVE MAY BE I GOT IT RIGHT THREE TO TEN TIMES NOW BEING EVEN MORE GENEROUS WITH MYSELF AND I DO THIS POST TRAINING SESSION WHEN I LET MY BRAIN IDLE AND I GET SOME GOOD SLEEP AND I COME BACK AND OI START GENERING ERRORS AGAIN PRESUMELY OR HOPEFULLY FEWER RRORS BUT I DECIDE ON AN ACCUE MY ATTENTION TO SOMETHING VERY SPECIFIC LIKE MAYBE AH HOW TIGHTLY I'M HOLDING THE RACKET OR MAYBE IT'S MY STANCE OR MAYBE IT'S A WHETHER NOT I ROTATE MY RIGHT SHOULDER IN AS AS I HIT THE BALL ACROSS THAN I MAKING THES UP AGAIN I DON'T PLAYTENNIS TURNS OUT THAT AS LONG AS IT'S THE SAME THING THROUGHOUT THE SESSION LEARNING IS ACCELERATED AND I'LL EXPLAIN WHY THIS IS MAKE SENSE IN A MOMENT BUT JUST TO BE REALLY CLEAR YOU CAN AND ONE SHOUD YUSE YOUR POWERS OF ATTENTION TO DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION TO PARTICULAR ASPECTS OF A MOTOR MOVEMENT ONCE YOUR FAMILIAR WITH THE GENERAL THEME OF THE MOVEMENT BUT WHAT YOU PAY ATTENTION TO EXACTLY IS NOT IMPORTANT WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT YOU PAY ATTENTION TO ONE SPECIFIC THING SO AT CLAUDIA LAPE ANG COLLEAGUE SHOWED WAS THAT IF PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO LEARN A SEQUENCE OF KEYS ON THE PIANO THERE ARE MULTIBLE FORMS OF FEED BACK THERE ARE ERROR SIGNALS IF FOR INSTANCE THEY HEA 'RE A PIECE OF MUSIC AND THEN THEY'RE TOLD TO PRESS THE KEYS IN A PARTICULAR SEQUENCE AND THE NOISE THAT COMES OUT THE SOUND THAT COMES OUT OF THE PIANO  DOES NOT SOUND LIKE THE SONG THEY JUST HEARD RIGHT SO INSTEAD OF A AND HERE FORGIVE ME BECAUSE I CAN NEITHER IM NEITHER MUSICAL NOR CAN I SING BUT INSTEAD OF DENTETTETETE THEY HEAR THAT E E TETETE TE TE AND THEN INSTEAD WHEN THEY PLAY ARRMEIT WOULD SOUND SOMETHING LIKE DENTENTIT WOULDN'T SOUND RIGHT  IT WOULDN'T SOUND RIGHT BECAUSE I LIKELY GOT THE SEQUENCE WRONG OR I WAS PRESSING TOO HARD ON THE KEYS OR TOO LIGHTLY ON THE KEYS ET CETERA WHAT THEY SHOWED WAS IF THEY JUST INSTRUCT PEOPLE ABOUT THE CORRECT SEQUENCE TO PRESS ON THE KEYS IT ACTUALLY DOESN'T MATTER WHAT SOUND COMES BACK PROVIDED IT'S THE CORRECT SOUND OR IT'S THE SAME SOUND RIGHT SO HERE'S THE EXPERIMENT THEY HADE PEOPLE PRESS ON THESE KEYS AND THE IT WAS A TYPICAL PIANO AND IT GENERATED THE PARTICULAR SEQUENCE OF SOUNDS THAT WOULD BE GENERATE BY PRESSING THE KEYS ON THE PIANO OR THEY MODIFIED THE KEYBOARD IN THIS CASE OR PIANO SUCH THAT WHEN PEOPLE PRESSED ON THE KEYS A RANDOM TONE DIFFERENT TONES WERE PLAYED EACH TIME THEY PRESSED ON THE KEYS SO IT SOUNDED CRAZY IT SOUNDED LIKE NOISE BUT THE MOTOR SEQUENCE WAS THE SAME OR THEY HAD A SINGLE TONE THAT WAS PLAYED EVERY TIME THEY PRESS THE KEY AND THE JOB ERE THE TASK OF THE SUBJECT WAS JUST TO PRESS THE SEQUENCE IT IT PRESSED THE KEYS IN THE PROPER SEQUENCE SO INSTEAD F DETETETETETETEIT WAS JUST DETETETETETETE INSTEAD OF DE TETE EE E TE IT'S DE TEDE DETE E THE IT'S EVEN HARD FOR ME TO SAY IT I CON IT EVEN A TONE BUT YOU GET THE IDEA SO A SINGULAR TONE JUST THINK A DOOR BELL BEING WRONG WITH EACH PRESS OF THE KEY WEL BE REALLY ANNOYING  BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT THE RATE TOMOTOR LEARNING WAS THE SAME WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE GETTING FEED BACK THAT WAS ACCURATE TO THE KEYS OF THE PIANO OR WHETHER NOT IT WAS A CONSTANT TONE PERFORMANCE WAS TERRIBLE AND THE RATES OF LEARNING WERE TERRIBLE IF THEY WERE GETTING RANDOM TONES BACK SO WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT LEARNING TO PLAY THE PIANO AT LEAST AT THESE EARLY STAGES IS REALLY JUST ABOUT GENERATING THE MOTOR COMMANS IT'S NOT ABOUT PAYING ATTENTION TO THE SOUND THAT'S COMING OUT OF THE PIANO AND THIS MAKE SENSE BECAUSE WHEN WE ARE BEGINNERS WE ARE TRYING TO FOCUS OUR ATTENTION ON THE THINGS THAT WE CAN CONTROL AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT THIS IF YOU CONCEPTIALIZE THIS PRESSING THE KEYS ON THE PIANO AND PAYING ATTENTION TO THE SOUNDS THAT ARE COMING OUT OR TWO THINGS SO WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT AS YOU GET DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO OPPRACTIS FOCUSSING PURELY ON THE MOTOR EXECUTION CAN BE BENEFICIAL NOW THIS IS GOING TO BE HARDER TO DO WITH OPEN LOOP TYPE THINGS WHERE YOU'RE GETTING FEED BACK I GUESS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF OPEN LOOP WOULD BE THE ATTEMPT AT A BACKFLIP RIGHT IF YOU GET IT WRONG YOU WILL IMMEDIATELY KNOW IF YOU GET IT RIGHT YOU'LL IMMEDIATELY KNOW PLEASE DON'T GO OUT AND TRYING TO A BACKLIP ON ON THE SOLID GROUND OR EVEN ON A TRAMPLING IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING BECAUSE VERY LIKELY YOU'L GET IT WRONG AND YOU'LL GET INJURED BUT IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS CLOSE SLOOP WHERE YOU CAN REPEAT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN THAT IS ADVANTAGEOUS BECAUSE YOU CAN PERFORM MANY MANY REPETITIONS AND YOU CAN START TO FOCUS OR LEARN TO FOCUS YOUR ATTENTION JUST ON THE PATTERN OF MOVEMENT IN OTHER WORDS YOU CAN LEARN TO PLAY THE PIANO JUST AS FAST OR MAYBE VEN FASTER BY JUST FOCUSING ON THE SEQUENCE THAT YOU ARE MOVING YOUR DIGETS YOUR FINGERS AND NOT THE FEED BACK NOW I'M SURE THERE ARE MUSIC TEACHERS OUT THEIR AND PIANO TEACHERS ARE SCREAMING NO YOU'RE GIN RUIN THE PRACTICE THAT ALL OF US HAVE IMBEDDED IN OUR MINDS IN OUR STUDENTS AND I AGREE AT SOME POINT YOU NEED TO START INCLUDING FEED BACK ABOUT WHETHER NOT THINGS SOUND CORRECT BUT ONE OF THE BEAUTIES OF SKILL LEARNING IS THAT YOU CAN CHOOSE TO PERAMETERIZE IT MEANING YOU CAN CHOOSE TO JUST FOCUS ON THE MOTOR SEQUENCE OR JUST FOCUS ON THE SOUNDS THAT ARE COMING BACK AND THEN INTEGRATE THOSE AND SO WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT CHUNKING ABOUT BREAKING THINGS DOWN INTO THEIR COMPONENT PARTS BUT ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES FOR SKILL LEARNING IS KNOWING WHERE TO PLACE YOUR ATTENTION SO TO DIAL OUT AGAIN WERE BUILDING A PROTOCAL ACROSS THIS EPISODE EARLY SESSIONS MAYBE IT'S THE FIRST ONE MAY BET'S THE FIRST TEN MAYBE IT'S THE FIRST HUNDRED IT DEPENDS ON HOW MANY REPETITIONS YOUR PACKING IN BUT DURING THOSE INITIAL SESSIONS THE KEY IS TO MAKE MANY ERRORS TO LET THE REWARD PROCESS GOVERN THE PLASTICITY LET THE ERRORS OPEN THE PLASTICITY AND THEN AFTER THE LEARNING SESSIONS TO LET THE BRAIN GO IDLE LEAST FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND OF COURSE TO MAXIMI SLEEP AS YOU START INCORPORATING MORE SESSIONS YOU START TO GAIN SOME SKILL LEVEL LEARNING TO HARNESS AND FOCUSS YOUR ATTENTION ON PARTICULAR FEATURES OF THE MOVEMENT INDEPENDENT OF THE REWARDS AND THE FEED BACK RIGHT SO THE REWARD IS NO LONGER IN THE TONE COMING FROM THE PIANO OR WHETHER NOT YOU STRUCK THE TARGET CORRECTLY BUT SIMPLY THE MOTOR MOVEMENT FOCUSING YOUR O FOR INSTANCE IN A DART THROW ON THE ACTION OF YOUR ARM THAT IS IMBEDDING THE PLASTICITY IN THE MOTOR PATTERN MOST DEEPLY THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN SHOWN BY THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE I'M SURE THERE ARE COACHES AND TEACHERS OUT THERE THAT WILL ENTIRELY DISAGREE WITH ME AND THAT'S GREAT PLEASE YOU KNOW LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU PREFER LET ME KNOW WHERE YOU THINK THIS IS WRONG A AND IT RARELY HAPPENS WUT LET ME KNOW WHERE YOU THINK THIS MIGHT BE RIGHT AS WELL SO WERE BREAKING THE LEARNING PROCESS DOWN INTO ITS COMPONENT PARTS AS WE GET MORE AND MORE SKILLED MEANING AS WE MAKE FEWER AND FEWER ERRORS PERA GIVEN SESSION PERUNIT TIME THAT'S WHEN ATTENTION CAN START TO MYGRATE FROM ONE FEATURE SUCH AS THE MOTOR SEQUENCE TO ANOTHER FEACER WHICH IS PERHAPS AM ONE'S STANCE AND AN OTHER SEQUENCE A COMPONENT OF THE SEQUENCE WHICH WOULD BE THE RESULT THAT'S ONE GETTING ON A TRIAL TO TRIAL BASIS RIGHTS OF CHANGING IT UP EACH TIMESO MAY BE I SERVE THE TENNIS BALL AND INFOCUSSING ON WHERE THE BALL LANDS THEN I'M FOCUSSING ON THE SPEED THAN INFOXING ON MY GRIP THAN INFOXING O MY STANCE FROM TRIAL TO TRIAL BUT UNTIL WE'VE MASTERED THE COR MOTOR MOVEMENTS WHICH IS DONE SESSION TO SESSION THAT AT LEAST ACCORDING TO THE LITERATURE THAT I HAVE ACCESS TO HEAR SEEMS TO BE SUBOPTIMAL SO HOPEFULLY THIS IS STARTING TO MAKE SENSE WHICH IS THAT YOU THESE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN UPPER MOTOR NOR ONS LOWER MOTOR NOR ONS AND CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATORS YOU CAN'T ATTACK THEM ALL AT ONCE YOU CAN'T TRY AND CHANGE THEM ALL AT ONCE AND SO WHAT WERE DOING IS WERE BREAKING THINGS DOWN INTO THEIR COMPONENT PARTS SOME OF YOU MAY BE WONDERING ABOUT SPEED OF MOVEMENT THERE ARE SOME DATA MEANING SOME DECENT PAPERS OUT THERE SHOWING THAT ULTRA SLOW MOVEMENTS PERFORMING A MOVEMENT IT ESSENTIALLY IN SLOW MOTION CAN BE BENEFICIAL FOR ENHANCING THE RATE OF SKILL LEARNING HOWEVER IT LEAST FROM MY READ OF THE LITERATURE IT APPEARS THAT ULTRA SLOW MOVEMENTS SHOULD BE PERFORMED AFTER SOME DEGREE OF PROFICIENCY HAS ALREADY BEEN GAINED IN THAT PARTICULAR MOVEMENT NOW THAT'S NOT THE WAY I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT I WOULD A THOUGHT WELL YOU KNOW YOURE LEARNING HOW TO DO A PROPER KICK OR A PAUNCH IN MARSHAL ARTS OR SOMETHING THAT ULTRA SLOW MOVEMENTS AT FIRST ARE GOING TO BE THE WAY THAT ONE CAN A YOU KNOW BEST LEARN HOW TO PERFORM A MOVEMENT AND THEN YOU JUST GRADUALLY INCREASE THE SPEED AND TURNS OUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE AND I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT AND YOU SHOULD PROBABLY KNOW THAT BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT WHEN YOU DO ULTRA SLOW MOVEMENTS TWO THINGS AREN'T AVAILABLE TO YOU ONE IS THE PROPRACEPTIVE FEED BACK IS NOT ACCURATE BECAUSE FAST MOVEMENTS OF LIMBS ARE VERY DIFFERENT THAN SLOW MOVEMENTS OF LIMBS SO YOU DON'T GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD IN THE PROPRIACEPTIVE FEED BACK BUT THE OTHER REASON WHY IT DOESN'T WORK IS THAT IT'S TOO ACCURATE YOU DON'T GENERATE ERRORS AND SO THE DATA THAT I WAS ABLE TO FIND SHOWED THAT VERY SLOW MOVEMENTS CAN BE BENEFICIAL IF ONE IS ALREADY PROFICIENT IN A PRACTISE BUT VERY SLOW MOVEMENTS AT THE BEGINNING DON'T ALLOW YOU TO LEARN MORE QUICKLY BECAUSE YOU NEVER GENERATE ERRORS AND THEREFORE THE BRAIN DOESN'T IT'S NOT OPEN FOR CHANGE THE WINDOW FOR PLASTICITY IS NEVER SWUNG OPEN SO TO SPEAK SO BRINGS US BACK TO THE THEME THAT ERRORS ALLOW FOR PLASTICIT CORRECT PERFORMANCE OF MOVEMENTS OR SEMI CORRECT PERFORMANCE OF MOVEMENTS CUE HE THE SENAPSES IN THE BRAIN AREAS AND SPINAL CIRCUITS THAT NEED TO CHANGE AND THEN THOSE CHANGES OCCUR IN THE PERIOD IMMEDIATELY AFTER SKILL LEARNING AND IN SLEEP SO SUPER SLOW MOVEMENTS CAN BE BENEFICIAL ONCE YOU ALREADY HAVE SOME PROFICIENCIES SO THIS MIGHT BE STANDING IN YOUR LIVING ROOM AND JUST IN ULTRA SLOW MOTION PERFORMING YOUR TENNIS SERVE LEARNING TO R THINKING ABOUT HOW YOU'R ADJUSTING YOUR ELBOW IN YOUR ARM IN THE TROJECTORY EXACTLY HOW YOU WERE TAUGHT BY YOUR TENNIS COACH BUT TRYING TO LEARN IT THAT WAY FROM THE OUTSET DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE THE BEST WAY TO LEARN A SKILL WHEN SHOULD YOU START TO INTRODUCE SLOW LEARNING WELL OVIUCY TACKED YOUR COACHES ABOUT THIS BUT AH IF YOU DOING THIS RECREATIONALLY OR YOU DON'T HAVE A COACH I REALIZE MANY OF YOU DON'T I DON'T HAVE A COACH FOR ANYTHING THAT I DO I'M GOING OF JUST NAVIGATING IT A THROUGH THE IBY USING THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE IT APPEARS AT ONCE YOUR HITTING SUCCESSORATES OF ABOUT TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY PER CENT THAT'S WHERE THE SUPERSLOW MOVEMENTS CAN START TO BE BENEFICIAL BUT IF YOUARE STILL PERFORMING THINGS AT A RATE OF YOU KNOW FIVE OR TEN PER CENT CORRECT AND THE REST AR ERRORS THEN THE SUPERSLOW MOVEMENTS ARE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BENEFIT YOU THAT MUCH ALSO SUPERSLOW MOVEMENTS ARE NOT REALLY APPLICABLE TO A LOT OF THINGS A FOR INSTANCE A YOU COULD IMAGINE THROWING A DART SUPERSLOW MOTION BUT IF YOU ACTUALLY TRYING THROW AN ACTUAL DART THE DARTS JUST CAN A FALL OF THE FLOOR OBVIOUSLY SO THERE ARE NUMBER OF THINGS LIKE A YOUKNOW BASEBALL BAT SWING WHICH YOU CAN PRACTICE IN SUPERSLOW MOTION BUT IF YOU TRY NO DO THAT WITH AN ACTUAL BASEBALL OR SOFBALL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AS I CAN I GIVE YOU ANY KIND OF FEED BACK ABOUT HOW EFFECTIVE IT WAS SO SUPERSLOW A MOVEMENTS OR A DECELERATED MOVEMENT HAS ITS HAS ITS PLACE BUT ONCE YOU'RE ALREADY PERFORMING THINGS REASONABLY WELL LIKE MAYBE TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY PER CENT SUCCESSORA NOW AND I'VE TRIED THIS I ACTUALLY I STRUGGLE WITH BASKETABALL A FOR WHATEVER REASON AND MY FREETHROW IS TERRIBLE SO I'VE PRACTICED THREETHROWS IN SUPERSLOW MOTION AND I NAIL THEM EVERY TIME THAT HE PROMISE THERE'S NO BALL SOME OF YOU ALREADY HAVE OF FAIR DEGREE OF PERFICIENCY OF SKILL IN A GIVEN PRACTICE OR SPORT OR INSTRUMENT AND IF YOU'RE IN THE SORT OF ADVANCED INTERMEDIATE OR ADVANCE LEVELS OF PROFICIENCY FOR SOMETHING THERE IS A PRACTICE THAT YOU CAN FIND A INTERESTING DATA FOR IN THE LITERATURE WHICH INVOLVES METRONOMING SO THIS YOU'LL REALIZE RELATES TO GENERATING REPETITIONS AND IT RELATES TO THE TONE EXPERIMENT WHERE IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT YOUR ATTENTION IS CUE TO AS LONG AS YOU ARE PERFORMING MANY MANY REPTS OF THE MOTOR SEQUENTE YOU CAN USE A METRONOME AN OBVIOUSLY MUSICIANS DO THIS BUT ATHLETES CAN DO THIS TOO YOU CAN USE A METRONOME TO SET THE CADENCE OF YOUR REPETICIONS NO FOR SWIMMERS THERE'S ACTUALLY A DEVICE I WAS ABLE TO FIND ON LINE I  FORGET WAT THE BRANDNAME WAS AND  THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT BUT A THAT ACTUALY GOES IN THE SWIM CAP THAT CAN CUE YOU TO WHEN YOU NEED TO PERFORM ANOTHER STROKE AND FOR RUNNERS THERE'S A THEREARE OTHER METRONOME TYPED DEVICES THAT A THROUGH HEADPHONES OR THROUGH A TONE IN THE ROOM IF YOURE RUNNING INDOORS ARE ON A TREADMILL WILL CUE YOU TO WHEN YOU BASICALLY YOU NEED TO LIFT YOUR HEELS AND IF YOU DO THAT A WHAT ATHLETES FIND IS THEY C ND PERFORM MORE REPETITIONS THAY CAN GENERATE MORE OUTPUT YOU CAN INCREASE SPEED A NUMBER REALLY INTERESTING THINGS ARE BEING DONE WITH AUDITORY METRONOMING AND THEN I'M INVOLVED IN A LITTLE BIT OF WORK NOW THAT A HOPEFULLY I'LL BE ABLE TO REPORT BACK TO YOU ABOUT USING STROPE OF SCOPIC METRONOMING SASHALY CHANGING THE THE SPEED OF THE VISUAL ENVIRONMENT THESE ARE FUN EXPERIMENTS EXPBASELY CHANGING ONE'S PERCEPTION OF HOW FAST THEIR MOVING THROUGH SPACE BY PLAYING WITH THE VISUAL SYSTEM SOMETHING FOR A FUTURE DISCUSSION BUT YOU CAN START TO USE AUDITORY METRONOMING FOR GENERATING MORE MOVEMENTS PER UNIT TIME AND GENERATING MORE ERRORS AND THEREFORE MORE SUCCESSES AND MORE NERROL PLASTICITY THERE ARE NUMBER DIFFERENT APS OUT THERE AM I FOUND SEVERAL FREE APS WHERE YOU CAN SET IN IMETRONOME PAYSO MIGHT BE TITCTITITITC THAT'S A LITTLE FAST FOR MOST THINGS BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE IF THIS WERE A DARTS OR THIS WERE A GOLF SWINGS THAT YOU MIGHT BE TICTICTITIC OR SOMETHING MORE LIKE TICTIC AND EVERY TIME THE METRONOME GOES YOU SWING EVERY TIME THE METRONON GOES YOU THROW A DART SHE'S EN WILD EXPERIMENTS OUT THERE YUNOTHERE'S HE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP OF CUP STACKING S A A YOUNG LADY WHO AM I SAW COULD TAKE ALL THESE CUPS SPREAD OUT ON A TABLE AND BASICALLY JUST STACK THEM INTO THE PERFECT PYRAMID AND THE LEAST AMOUNT OFTIMES ALL THE KIDS GO WILD THIS IS OMETHY I NEVER THOUGHT TO PURSUE IN AND FRANKLY NEVER WILL PURSUE UM UNLESS MY LIFE DEPENDS ON IT FOR SOME REASON BUT'S REALLY IMPRESSIVE AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE SEQUENTS CAUSE THESE HAVE BEEN RECORDED YOU CAN LOOK THIS UP ON ON YOU TOB A WHAT YOU'LL FIND IS THAT THESE EXPERT CUPSTACKERS IS JUST ALL ABOUT ERROR LIMINATION BUT THERE TO METRONOMING AND AUDITORY CUSE CAN ACTUALLY CUE THEM TO PICK UP THE CUPS FASTER THAN THEY WOULD ORDINARILY AND TO LEARN TO DO THAT YOU CAN DO THIS FOR ANYTHING I THINK CUPSTACKING AM IS PROBABLY NOT A SKILL MOST OF YOUR INTEREST IN DOING BUT AM FOR ANY SKILL IF YOU FIGURE OUT AT WHAT RATE YOU ARE PERFORMING REPETITIONS PER UNIT TIME AND YOU WANT TO INCREASE THAT SLIGHTLY YOU SET A METRONOME WHICH IS SLIGHTLY FASTER THAN YOUR CURRENT RATE AND YOU JUST START GENERATING MORE REPETITIONS NOW WHIT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS IN IS COOL IS IT RELATES BACK TO THE EXPERIMENT FROM LAPEING COLLEAGUES WHICH IS YOUR ATTENTION IS NOW HARNESS TO THE TONE TO THE METRONOME NOT NECESSARILY TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN TERMS OF THE MOTOR MOVEMENT AND SO REALLY YOU NEED A BIT OF PREFICIENCY AGAIN THIS IS FOR PEOPLER IN INTERMEDIATEOR ADVANCED INTERMEDIATE OR ADVANCE BUT WHAT YOU'R ESSENTIALLY DOING IS YOURE CREATING AND OUTSIDE PRESSURE A CONTINGENCY SO THAT YOU GENERATE AGAIN MORE ERRORS SO IT'S ALL ABOUT THE ERRORS THAT YOU GET AND NOW THESE ARE AN ERRORS WHERE ALL THE CUPS TUMBLE OR YOU HAVE TO STOP OR YOU KAN'T KEEP UP YOEVE TO SET THE PACE JUST A LITTLE BIT BEYOND WHAT YOU CURRENTLY CAN DO AND WHEN YOU WHEN YOU DO THAT YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY FORCING THE NERVOUS SYSTEM TO MAKE ERRORS AND CORRECT THE ERRORS INSIDE OF THE SESSION I FIND THIS REALLY INTERESTING BE CAUSE WHAT IT MEANS IS AGAIN YOU'VE GOT SENSURY PERCEPTION WHAT YOUR PAYING ATTENTION TO PROPRIACEPTION WHERE YOUR LIMBS ARE AND THE MOTOR NERONS IN YOUR UPPER LOWER MOTOR NERONS AND CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATORS AND YOU CAN'T PAY ATTENTION TO WELL THEY'RE MY OW UPPER MOTORNRONS THEY ARE MY LOWER MOTOR NONS FORGET THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT YOU CAN'T PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR PROPRACEPTION TOO MUCH THAT WOULD BE THE SUPERSLOW MOTION WOULD BE THE PROPRIACEPTION BUT YOU HAVE TO HARNESS YOUR ATTENTION TO SOMETHING AND IF YOU HARNESS YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS OUTSIDE CONTINGENCY THIS METRONOME THAT'S FIRING OFF AND SAYING NOW GO NOW GO NOW GO NOT ONLY CAN YOU INCREASE THE NUMBER OF REPETITIONS ERRORS AND SUCCESSES BUT FOR SOME REASON AND WE DON'T KNOW WHY THE REGULAR CADENCE OF THE TONE OF THE METRONOME AND THE FACT THAT YOU ARE ANCHORING YOUR MOVEMENTS TO SOME EXTERNAL FORCE TO SOME EXTERNAL PRESSURE OR CUE SEEMS TO ACCELERATE THE PLASTICITY AND THE CHANGES AND THE ACQUISITION OF SKILLS BEYOND WHAT IT WOULD BE IF YOU JUST DID THE SAME NUMBER OF REPETITIONS WITHOUT THAT OUTSIDE PRESSURE WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE MECHANISM IS PRESUMABLY IT'S NEAR A CHEMICAL LIKE THEI'R SOMETHING ABOUT KEEPING UP WITH A TIMER OR WITH A PACE THAT PRESUMABLY AND I'M SPECULATING HERE CAUSES THE RELEASE OF PARTICULAR CHEMICALS BUT I THING IT'S REALLY COOL METRONOMES THAT THEY'RE TOTALLY INEXPENSIVE AT LEAST THE ONE THAT YOU USE TO OUTSIDE OF WATER ARE VERY INEXPENSIVE YOU CAN FIND THESE FREE APS OWM YOU CAN IS A MUSICAL METRONOME SO METRONOMES ARE A POWERFUL TOOL AS WELL IN PARTICULAR FOR SPEED WORK SO FOR SPRINTING OR SWIMMING OR RUNNING WHERE THE GOAL IS TO GENERATE MORE STROKES OR MORE EFFICIENT STROKES OR MORE STEPS ET CETERA THE THE RATE OF THE METRONOME OBVIOUSLY IS GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT SOMETIMES YOU'RE TRYING TO LENGTH IN YOU'R STRIDES SOMETIMES YOU'R YOU'RE TRYING TO TAKE FEWER STROKES BUT GLIDE FURTHER IN THE POOL FOR INSTANCE BUT THE VALUE OF OCCASIONALLY JUST INCREASING THE NUMBER OF REPETITIONS THE NUMBER OF STROKES OR STEPS ET CETERA PERUNIT TIME IS ALSO THAT YOU'RE TRAINING THE CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATORS TO OPERATE AT THAT HIGHER SPEED YOU ONE OF THE SPORTS HAS KIND OF INTERESTING TO ME AS SPEED WALKING IT'S NOT ONE I ENGAGE IN OR EVER PLAN TO ENGAGE IN BUT IFYOUVE EVER TRIED TO REALLY SPEED WALK IT'S IT'S ACUALLY DIFFICULT TO WALK VERY VERY FAST WITHOUT BREAKING INTO A RUN ALL ANIMALS HAVE THESSE GIND OF CROSS OVER POINTS WHERE THEY GO WHERE YOU GO YOUN I THINK OF HORSES AIT'S LIKE THAT WAS THAT THEY THEY TROT THAN THEY GALLOPON WHAT'S THE NEXT THING I N CLEARLY ON'T KNOWING ABOUT A ABOUT HORSES A EXCEPT THAT THEY'R BEAUTIFUL AND I LIKE THEM VERY MUCH BUT THEY THEY BREAK INTO A DIFFERENT KIND OF STRIDE AND THAT'S BECAUSE YOU SHIFT OVER TO DIFFERENT PATCENTRAL PATTERN GENERATORS SO WHEN YOU'RE WALKING OR A HORSE IS MOVING VERY SLOWLY AND THEN IT BREAKS INTO A JOG AND THEN INTO A FULL SPRINTER I I GET I TE GALLOP FOR THE HORSE YOUR ACTALLY ENGAGING DIFFERENT CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATORS AND THOSE CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATORS ALWAYS HAVE A RANGE OF SPEEDS THAT THEIR HAPPIEST O FUNCTION AT SO WITH THE METRONOMING FOR FOR SPEED PURPOSES WHAT YOU DO IS YOU CAN YOU CAN BASICALLY BRING THE ACTIVITY OF THOSE CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATOS INTO THEIR UPPER UPPER RANGE AND MAY BE EVEN EXTEND THEIR RANGE AND THERE' A FASCINATING BIOLOGY OF HOW CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATORS WORK TOGETHER OTHERE'S COUPLING OF CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATORS ET CETERA TO IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE MAXIMAL SPEEDS AND ET CETERA IT'S A TOPIC FOR A KIND OF AN ADVANCE CEPTION COSTILL LOVES THE TOPIC YOU JUST PARKE AND LOVES IS SO MUCH YEUBARKED AGAIN IN ANY EVENT THE METRONOM IS A POWERFUL TOOL AGAIN FOR MORE ADVANCED PRACTITIONERS OR FOR ADVANCED INTERMEDIATE PRACTITIONERS BUT OM IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE IT IT BRINGS BACK THE POINT THAT WHAT WE PUT OUR ATTENTION TO WHILE WE'RE SKILL LEARNING IS IMPORTANT TO THE EXTENT THAT IT'S ON ONE THING AT LEAST FOR THE MOMENT OR TRIAL TO TRIAL BUT THAT WHAT WE FOCUSS OUR ATTENTION ON CAN BE EXTERNAL IT CAN BE INTERNAL AND ALTIMATELY THE SKILL LEARNING IS WHERE ALL THAT IS BROUGHT TOGETHER SO LIT'S TALK ABOUT WERE SKILL LEARNING OCCURS IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THEN I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A REALLY O WHAT I THINK IS A REALLY COOL TOOL THAT CAN INCREASE FLEXIBILITY IND RANGE OF MOTION BASED ON THIS PARTICULAR BRAIN AREA SO THE TOOL THAT I USED IND WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT I DID NOT BELIEVE WOULD WORK UT I'S NOT A HACK THIS IS ACTUALLY ANCHOR DEEPLY IN THE BIOLOGY OF A PARTICULAR BRAIN REGION THAT WE ALL HAVE A WHICH WHOSE MEANING IS MINI BRAIN AND THAT MINI BRAIN THAT WE ALL HAVE IS CALLED YOUR SARA BELLUM THE SARABELLUM IS CALLED THE MANY BRAIN BECAUSE IT'S IN THE BACK YOUR BRAIN T LOKS LIKE A LITTLE MANY VERSION OF THE REST OF YOUR BRAIN SIN ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE STRUCTURE THAT'S INVOLVED IN MOVEMENT IT ALSO HAS A LOT OF NON MOVEMENT ASSOCIATED FUNCTIONS IN BRIEF THE SARABELLUM GET'S IN PUT FROM YOUR SENSES PARTICULAR YOUR EYES AND PAYSITINTO WEARE YOUR EYES ARE IN SPACE WHAT YOUR LOOKING AT IT BASICALLY TAKES INFORMATION ABOUT THREE ASPECTS OF YOUR EYES AND EYE MOVEMENTS WHICH ARE OCCURRING WHEN YOUR HEAD GOES LIKE THIS WHICH IS CALLED PITCH I THIS  PITCH FOR THOSE YOU LISTENING I'M JUST NODDING UP AND DOWN THEN THERE'S YAW WHICH IS LIKE SHAKING YOUR HEAD KNOW FROM SIDE ASIDE AND THEN THERE'S ROLL WHICH YOU KNOW IS LIKE SOMETIMES IF YOU SEE A A PRIMATE LIKE A MARMOCET OR SOMETHING THEY WILL ROLL THEIR HEAD WHEN THEY LOOK AT YOU ASHALLY THE REASON THEY DO THAT IS IT HELPS GENERATE DEPTH PERCEPTION IT'S A KIND OF FORM OF MOTION PARALAX IF YOU CURIOUS WHY THEY DO THAT IT'S NOT TO LOOKCUTE THEY DO IT BECAUSE WHEN THEY DO THAT EVEN IF YOUR STATIONARY IN THEIR STATIONARY THEY GET BETTER DEPTH PERCEPTION AS TO HOW FAR AWAY FROM THEM YOU ARE SO YOU'VE GOT PITCH YAW AND ROLL AND AS YOU MOVE YOUR HEAD AND AS YOU MOVE YOUR BODY AND YOU MOVE THROUGH SPACE THE IMAGE ON YOUR ETNA MOVES PITCHYON ROLL AND SOME COMBINATION THAT INFORMATION IS RELAID TO YOUR SARABELLUM SO IT'S RICH WITH VISUAL INFORMATION THERE'S ALSO A MAP OF YOUR BODY SURFACE AND YOUR MOVEMENTS AND TIMING IN THE SARABELLUM SO IT'S AN INCREDIBLE STRUCTURE THAT BRINGS TOG ETHER TIMING OF MOEMENTS WHICH LIMBS ARE MOVING AND HAS PORPERACEPTIVE INFORMATION IT REALLY AS A MANY BRAIN ITS JUST THE COOLEST LITTLE STRUCTURE BACK THERE AND IN HUMANSZACTUALLY NOT THAT LITTLE IT'S JUST A ANINCREDIBLE STRUCTURE NOW ALL THIS INFORMATION IS INTEGRATED THERE BUT WHAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T TELL US IS THAT A LOT OF LEARNING OF MOTOR SEQUENCES OF SKILL LEARNING THAT INVOLVE TIMING OCCURS IN THE SARABELLUM NOW YOU CAN'T REALLY USE THAT INFORMATION EXCEPT TO KNOW THAT AFTER YOU LEARN SOMETHING PRETTY WELL AT'S HANDED OFFWARD IND OF HANDLED BY YOUR SARABELLUM BUT THERE IS SOMETHING TAT YOU CAN DO WITH YOUR SARABELLUM TO INCREASE RANGE OF MOTION AND FLEXIBILITY MUCH OF OUR FLEXIBILITY BELIEVE IT OR NOT IS NOT BECAUSE OUR TENDONS ARE OF PARTICULAR LENGTH OR A ELASTICITY ALTHOUGH THAT PLAYS IT SOMEROLE IT'S NOT BECAUSE OUR MUSCLES ARE SHORT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WOULD EVEN MEAN SOMETEOLE HAVE HAVE LONGER MUSCLE BELLIES OR SHORT ER MUSCLE BELLIES BUT YOUR MUSCLES ALWAYS ESSENTIALLY SPAN THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE OF THE THE BONE OR LIMB OR CLOSE TO IT ALONG WITH YOUR TENDENTS BUT AS TO DO WITH THE NURL INNERVATION OF MUSCLE AND THE FACT THAT WHEN MUSCLES ARE ELONGATED THERE'S A POINT AT WHICH THEY WON'T STRETCH OUT ANY LONGER AND THE NERVES FIRE AND THEY SHUT DOWN THAT YOU ACTULY HAVE INHIBITORY PATHWAYS THAT THAT PREVENT YOU FROM CONTRACTING THE MUSCLES OR EXOR FROM EXTENDING THEM FROM STRETCHING THEM OUT ANY MORE SO YOU CAN DO THIS RIGHT NOW IF YOUR DRIVING DON'T DO IT BECAUSE UNLESS YOU HVE A SELF TRIVING CAR YOU'LL NEED TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF THE STEERING WHEEL BUT BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT VISION AND YOURE MUSCLES ARE REPRESENTED IN YOUR SARABELLUM IT TURNS OUT THAT YOUR RANGE OF VISUAL MOTION AND YOUR RANGE OF VISION LITERALLY HOW WIDE A FIELD OF VIEW YOU TAKE IMPACTS HOW FAR YOU CAN EXTEND YOUR LIMBS CSO A WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS IN A SECOND ANOUT EXACTLY HOW TO DO THIS AN EXPLORE THIS BUT AS YOU MOVE THROUGH SPACE AS YOU WALK FORWARD OR YOU WALK BACKWARD R YOU TILT YOUR HEAD OR YOU LEARN A SKILL OR YOU JUST OPERATE IN THE NORMAL WAYS THROUGHOUT YOUR DAY DRIVING BIKING ET CETERA YOUR EYES ARE GENERATING SPONTANEOUS MOVEMENTS TO OFFSET VISION VISUAL SLIP IN OTHER WORDS YOU DON'T SEE THE WORLD AS BLURRY EVEN THOUGH YOU'R MOVING BECAUSE YOUR EYES ARE GENERING LITTLE COMPENSITORY EYE MOVEMENTS TO OFFSET YOUR MOTION SOF I SPIN WE COULD DO THIS EXPERIMENT THERE'S A FUN EXPERIMENT WE DO WITH MEDICAL STUDENTS OM WHERE YOU A SPIN THEM AROUND IN A CHAIR WIH THIR EYES CLOSED AND THEN YOU STOP AND YU HAVE THEM OPEN THEIR EYES IN THEIR EYES ARE GOING LIKE THAT I NI STAGMES I DON'T SUGGEST YOU DO THIS EXPERIMENT AH WHEN WE WERE KIDS WE DID A DIFFERENT EXPERIMENT WHICH WAS TO TAKE A STICK AND TO LOOK AT THE TOP OF THE STICK AND TO SPIN AROUND ON THE LAWN LOOKING AT THE TOP OF THE TICK THAND PUT IT DOWN ON THE GROUND AND TRYING JUMP OVER IT OU END UP LIKE JUMPING TO THE SIDE YOU MISS THE THING ENTIRELY THE REASON THOSE TWO QUOTUN QUOTE EXPERIMENTS WHICH I HOPE YOU DON'T DO WE'RE FOR SOMEBODY ELSE TO DO THE REASON THEY WORK IS BECAUSE NORMALLY YOUR EYE MOVEMENTS AND YOUR BALANCE IND YOUR LIMB MOVEMENTS ARE CORDINATED BUT WHEN YU SPIN AROUND LOOKING UP AT THE STICK WHAT YOU'RE DOING AS YOU'RE FIXATING YOUR EYES ON ONE LOCATION WHILE YOU'RE MOVING AND THEN WHEN YOU STOP THOSE TWO MECHANISMS ARE COMPLETELY ON COUPLED AND IT'S LIKE BEING AT YOU KNOW THAT THROWN INTO OUT OR SPACE THERE BEEN OUR SPACE BUT PROBLY SOMETHING LIKE THAT LOGRAVITY'S ZEROGRAVITY IF YOU SPIN AROUND IN YOUR CHAIR WITH YOUR EYES CLOSED YOU'RE NOT GIVING THE VISUAL IM PUT THAT YOU'RE SPINNING AND THEN YOU OPEN THE EYES AND THEN THE EYES ONLY HAVE THE THE A WHAT WE CALL THE VESTIBULATING YOUR EYES JOLDING BACK AND FORTH BAGFORTH AGAIN THESE AREN'T EXPERMENTING YOU TO DO CAUSE I JUST TOLD YOU THE RESULT HOWEVER IF YOU WANT TO EXTEND YOUR RANGE OF MOTION YOU CAN DO THAT BY THESE THINGS ALWAYS LOOK GOOFY BUT AT THIS POINT I'M JUST CON USED TO DOING THESE THINGS IF I ONE EXTEND MY RANGE OF MOVEMENT FOR SO WANT TO MEASURE MY RANGE OF OF MOTION SO I'M TRYING TO IF YOU'R LISTENING WHAT I'M DONG AS I'M STRETCHING OUT MY ARMS FROM A LIKE A TEE AFR ON EITHER SIDE AND I'M TRYING TO PUSH THEM AS FAR BACK AS I CAN WHICH FOR ME IS YOU DON'T FEELS LIKE IT'S IN LINE WITH MY SHOULDERS AND I CAN'T GET MUCH FURTHER I'M NOT REALLY SUPERFLEXIBLE NORM I PARTICULARLY A INFLEXIBLE AT LEAST A PHYSICALLY SO WHAT I WOULD THEN DO IS STOP I WOULD MOVE MY EYES TO THE FAR PERIPHERY RIGHT S I'M MOVING MYYYES ALL THE WAY TO LEFT WHILE KEEPING MY HEAD EN BODY STATIONARY I'M TRYING TO LOOK OVER MY LEFT SHOULDER AS FAR AS I CAN THEN OFF TO THE RIGHT SI AWKWARD TO DO THIST THEN UP THEN DOWN BUT I'M MOSTLYGANA JUST FOCUS ON LEFT AND THEN RIGHT NOW WHAT THAT'S DOING IS ITS EXSENDING A SIGNAL TO MY SARABELLUM THAT MY FIELD OF VIEW IS WAY OVER TO THERE AND WAY OVER TO THERE MEMBER YOUR VISUAL ATTENTION HAS AN APERTURE I CAN BE NARROW OR CAN BE BROAD AND I'VE TALKED ABOUT SOME THE BENEFITS OF TAKING A BROAD VISUAL APERTURE IN ORDER TO RELAX THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THIS IS JUST MOVING MY EYES NOT MY HEAD LIKE I JUST DID FOR A SECOND FROM SIDE TO SIDE NOW I CAN RETEST AND ACTUALLY YOU GET ABOUT A FIVE TO FIFTEEN DEGREE INCREASE IN YOUR RANGE OF MOTION NI'M DOING THIS FOR YOU CAN SAY WELL YOU KNOWNG HE GAMED ITCAUSE HE KNEW THE THE RESULT THAT HEU WAS HOPING FOR BUT YOU CAN TRY THIS OGI SO AND YOU CAN DO THIS FOR LEGS TOO WHY YOU CAN DO THIS FOR ANY LIMB ESSENTIALLY AND THAT'S IT'S PURELY SARABELLA AND IT'S BECAUSE THE PROPRIACEPTIVE VISUAL AND LIMB MOVEMENT FEED BACK CONVERGIN IN THEIR IN THE WAYS THAT WE CONTROL OUR MUSCLE SPINDLES AND THE WAY WE CONTROL THE MUSCLE FIBRES AND THE TENDINS AND SINCE ULOUCAN GET BIGGER RANGE OF MOTION SO ACTUALLY WILL WARM UP BEFORE EXERCISE OR FOR BEFORE SKILL LEARNING BY BOTH DOING MOVEMENTS FROR MY BODY BUT ALSO MOVING MY EYES FROM SIDE TO SIDE IN ORDER TO GENERATE LARGER RANGE OF MOTION IF RANGE OF MOTION IS SOMETHING THAT I'M INTEREST D AND  THAT'S A FUN ONE THAT YOU CAN A PLAY WITH LOW BIT AM AND IT'S PURELY SARABELLAR SOME OTHER TIME WILL GET BACK INTO A SARABELLAR FUNCTION THERE'S ALL SORTS OF JUST INCREDIBLE STUFF THAT YOU CAN DO A SARABELLUM AH I TALKED IN AN EARLIER EPISODE ON NARROW PLASTICITY ABOUT HOW YOU CAN DESRUPT YOUR VESTIBULAR WORLD IN OTHER WORDS BY GETTING A INTO MODES OF EXCELERATION MOVING THROUGH SPACE WHERE YOU'RE TILTED IN CERTAIN WAYS IT CAN OPEN UP THE WINDOWS FOR PLASTICITY IN YET OTHER WAYS AM SO YOU CAN CHECK THAT OUT IDDS ONE OF THE EARLIER EPISODES ON NARROW PLASTICITY EVERYTHING'S TIME STAMPED BUT MEANWHILE IF YOU ON EXPAND YOUR RANGE OF MOTION BEFORE DOING SKILL LEARNING OR AFTERWARD THIS IS A FON ONE IT'S ALSO CUNNI NEAT BECAUSE A I HAVE THIS KIND OF AVERSION TO STRETCHING WORK IT NEVER SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING I WANT TO DO AND SO I ALWAYS PUT IT OFF SO IF I START WITH THE VISUAL PRACTICE OF EXPANDING MY FIELD OF VIEW TO OFF TO ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER SIDE OR UP OR DOWN THEN WHAT I FIND AS I'M NATURALLY MORE FLXIBLE 'M NOT NATURALLY MORE FLEXIBLE WHAT'S HAPPEN AS 'VE EXPANDIN MY RANGE OF MOTION LET'S TALK ABOUT VISUALIZATION AND MENTAL REHEARSAL BEEN ASKED ABOUT THIS A LOT AND I THINK IT RELATES BACK TO THAT KIND OF A MATRIXS HOLLYWOOD IDEA THAT WE CAN JUST BE IMBEDDED WITH A SKILL ALTHOUGH IN THIS CASE IN FAIRNESS VISUALIZATION INVOLVE SOME WORK AND I'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS ON AN EARLIER EPISODE THAT SOME PEOPLE FIND IT VERY HARD TO MENTALLY VISUALIZED THINGS AND SOME PEOPLE FIND IT VERY EASY THERE WAS GREAT WORK THAT WAS DONE IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES BY ROGER SHEPERD AT STAMFORD AND BY OTHERS LOOKING AT PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO ROTATE THREE DOMENTIONAL OBJECTS IN THEIR MIND AND SOME PEOPLE REALLY GOOD AT THIS AND SOME PEOPLE OR LESS GOOD AT THIS AND ONE CAN GET BETTER AT IT BY REPEATING IT BUT THE QUESTION WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH TO DAY IS DOES IT HELP DOES IT LET YOU LEARN THINGS FASTER AND INDEED THE ANSWER APPEARS TO BE YES IT CAN HOWEVER DESPITE WHAT YOU'VE HEARD IT IS NOT AS GOOD IT IS NOT A TOTAL REPLACEMENT FOR PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE ITSELF YESSO IBEN GOING TO BE REALLY CONCRETE ABOUT THIS I HEAR ALL THE TIME THAT JUST IMAGINING CONTRACTING A MUSCLE CAN LEAD TO THE SAME GAINS AS ACTUALLY CONTRACTING THAT MUSCLE JUST IMAGINING A SKILL CAN LEAD TO THE SAME INCREASES IN PERFORMANCE AS ACTUALLY EXECUTING THAT SKILL AND THATS SIMPLY NOT THE CASE HOWEVER IT CAN SUPPLEMENT OR SUPPORT PHYSICAL TRAINING AND SKILL LEARNING IN WAYS THAT ARE QUITE POWERFUL ONE OF THE MORE INTERESTING STUDIES ON THIS WAS FROM RANG GANATHAN AT ALL FORGIVE ME FOR THE PRONUNCIATION A THIS WAS A A SLIGHTLY OLDER PAPER TWO THOUSAND FOR BUT NONE THE LESS WAS A ONE THAT I THOUGHT HAD PARTICULARLY IMPRESSIVE RESULTS AND INCLUDED ALL THE APPROPRIATE CONTROLS ET CETERA AND WHAT THEY DID IS THEY LOOKED AT THIRTY SUBJECTS THEY DIVIDE THEM INTO DIFFERENT GROUPS A THEY HAD ONE GROUP PERFORM ASSENCIAA FINGER FLECTION SO AS I SUALLY THE SORT OF THE IMAGINE IF YOU'RE JUST LISTENING TO THIS THE YOU NO COME HERE A FINGER MOVEMENT AM THEY ALSO HAD A ELBOW FLECTIONS US OR BICEPT CROAL TYGPE MOVEMENT AND THEY EITHER HAD SUBJECTS DO A ACTUAL PHYSICAL MOVEMENT AGAINST RESISTANCE OR TO IMAGINE MOVING A THEIR FINGER OR THEIR A RIST TOWARDS THE SHOULDOR MEANING AT THE BENDING AT THE ELBOW A TOWARDS ACTUAL RESISTANCE UT JUST TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT THERE WERE INCREASES IN THIS FINGER ADUCTION STRENGTH ABDUCTIONS GIVES ME STRENGTH OF ABOUT THIRTY FIVE PER CENT AND THE ELBOW FLECTION STRENGTH BY ABOUT THIRTEEN POINT FIVE PER CENT WHICH ARE PRETTY IMPRESSIVE CONSIDERING THAT IT WAS JUST DONE MENTALLY SO THEY HAD PEOPLE IMAGINE MOVING AGAINST A WEIGHT A VERY HEAVY WEIGHT OR A HAD IMAGINE  PEOPLE MOVING THEIR RIST TOWARDS THEIR SHOULDER A AGAINST A VERY HEAVY WEIGHT BUT AGAIN THEY WEREN'T DOING IT THEY WERE JUST IMAGINING IT OTHER EXPERIMENTS LOOKED AT THE BRAIN IN WHAT WAS HAPPENING I THE BRAIN DURING THIS TIME A SO WILL TALK ABOUT THAT A MOMENT BUT ESSENTIALY WHAT THEY FOUND WER IMPROVEMENTS IN STRENGTH OF ANYWHERE FROM THIRTEEN POINT FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE PER CENT HOWEVER THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL TRAINING GROUP THE GROUPS THAT ACTUALLY MOVED THEIR RIST OR MOE THEIR FINGER AGAINST AN ACTUAL PHYSICAL WEIGHT HAD IMPROVEMENTS OF ABOUT FIFTY THREE PER CENT SO THIS REPEATS OVER AND OVER THROUGHOUT THE LITERATURE MENTAL REHEARSAL CAN CAUSE INCREASES IN STRENGTH IT CAN CREATE INCREASES IN SKILL ACQUISITION AND LEARNING BUT THEY ARE NEVER AS GREIT IF DONE ALONE AS COMPARED TO THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL EXECUTION OF THOSE MOEMENTS ARE THE PHYSICAL MOVEMENT OF THOSE WEIGHTS WHICH SHOULDN'T COME AS SO SURPRISING HOWEVER IF WE STEP BACK WHEN WE SAY WELL WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF THIS IMPROVEMENT YOU MIGHT NOT CARE WHAT THE SOURCE IS  CAUSE I COULD TELL YOU ITS ONE BRAINAREA OR ANOTHER RAINAIR WHAT WHAT DIFFERENCE WOULD MAKE BUT IF AGAIN IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND MECHANISM A LITTLE BIT YOU'RE IN A POSITION TO CREATE NEWER AND EVEN BETTER PROTOCALS WHAT MENTAL REHEARSAL APPEARS TO DO IS ENGAGED THE ACTIVITY OF THOSE UPPER MOTOR NER ONS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT WAY BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE MEMORY OF UPPER MOTOR NORONS THAT CONTROL DELIBERATE ACTION YOU'VE GOT LOWER MOTOR NORONS THAT ACTUALLY CONNECT TO THE MUSCLES AND MOVE THOSE MUSCLES AN YOU CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATORS MENTAL REHEARSAL CLOSING ONE'S EYES TYPICALLY AND THINKING ABOUT A PARTICULAR SEQUENCE OF MOVEMENT AND VISUALIZING IT IN ONE'S QUOTINQUMIND MIND'S EYE CREATES ACTIVATION OF THE UPPER MOTOR NOR ONS THAT VERY SIMILAR IF NOT THE SAME AS THE ACTUAL MOVEMENT AND THAT MAKE SENSE BECAUSE THE THE UPPER MOTOR NRONS ARE ALL ABOUT THE COMMAND FOR MOVEMENT THEY ARE NOT THE ONES THAT ACTUALLY EXECUTE THE MOVEMENT OK REMEMBER UPPER MOTOR NRONS ARE THE ONES THAT GENERATE THE COMMAND FOR MOVEMENT NOT THE ACTUAL MOVEMENT THE ONES THAT GENERATE THE ACTUAL MOVEMENT ARE THE LOWER MOTOR NERONS AND THE CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATORS SO VISUALIZATION IS A POWERFUL TOOL HOW CAN YOU USE A VISUALIZATION WELL IN THIS STUDY THEY HAD PEOPLE PERFORM THIS A FIVE DAYS A WEEK A I BELIEVE THAT A IT WAS FIFTEEN YES IT WAS FIFTEEN MINUTES PER DAY FIVE DAYS A WEEK FOR TWELVE WEEK SO THAT'S A LOT OF MENTAL REHEARSAL NO IT'S NOT A TON OF TIME EACH DAY FIFTEEN MINUTES PER DAY BUT SITTING DOWN CLOSING YOUR EYES IN IMAGINE AND GOING THROUGH A PARTICULAR SKILL A PRACTICE OR MOVING A WEAEK A MAYBE IT'S A PLAIN KEYS ON A PIANO IF THAT'S A YOUR THING OR OR STRINGS ON A GUITAR FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES A DAY FIVE DAYS PRFOR TWELVE WEEKS IS CONSIDERABLE I THINK MOST PEOPLE GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE ACTUAL PRACTICE THE PHYSICAL PRACTICE IS GOING TO LEAD TO LARGER IMPROVEMENTS GREATER IMPROVEMENTS THEN WOULD THE MENTAL TRAINING WOULD OPT FOR THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL TRAINING BUT OF COURSE IF YOU'RE ON A PLANE AND YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR GUITAR AND YOUR CERTINLY NOT CAN BE SPRINTING UP AND DOWN THE AISLE OR YOU ARE VERY SERIOUS ABOUT YOUR CRAFT AND YOU ON TO ACCELERATE PERFORMANCE OF YOUR CRAFT OR STRENGTH INCREASES OR SOMETHING THAT SORT THEN AUGMENTING OR ADDING IN THE VISUALIZATION TRAINING VERY LIKELY WILL COMPOUND THE EFFECTS OF THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL TRAINING THERE ARE NOT A LOT OF STUDIES LOOKING HOW VISUALIZATION ON TOP OF PURE PHYSICAL TRAINING CAN INCREASE THE RATS OF LEARNING AND CONSOLIDATION OF LEARNING ET CETERA IT'S ATUALY A HARD STUDY TO DO BE AS HARD TO CONTROL FOR BECAUSE WHAT WOULD YOU DO IN EX PLACE YOU WOULD PROBABLY ADD ACTUAL PHYSICAL TRAINING AND THEN IT THAT'S ALWAYS CAN A LEAD TO GREATER EFFECTS SO THE POINT IS IF YOU WANT TO USE VISUALIZATION TRAINING GREAT BUT FORGET THE IDEA THAT VISUALIZATION TRAINING IS AS GOOD AS THE ACTUAL BEHAVIOR YOU HEAR THIS ALL THE TIME PEOPLE SAY TO YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU IMAGINE AN EXPERIENCE TO YOUR BRAIN ANTO YOUR BODY IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE ACTUAL EXPERIENCE ABSOLUTELY NOT THIS IS NOT THE WAY THE NERVOUS SYSTEM WORKS I'M SORRY I DON'TMEAN TO BURST ANYBODY'S BUBBLE BUT A YIT YOUR BUBBLE IS MADE OF MYTHS AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT THE BRAIN WHEN IT EXECUTES MOVEMENT IS GENERATING PROPRIACEPTIVE FEED BACK AND THAT PROPRIATE SEPTO FEE BACK IS CRITICALLY INVOLVED IN GENERATING OUR SENSE OF THE EXPERIENCE AND IN THINGS LIKE LEARNING SO I DON'T SAY THIS AM BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA THAT VISUALIZATION COULDN'T WORK IN FACT VISUALIZATION DOES WORK BUT IT DOESN'T WORK AS WELL IT DOESN'T CREATE THE SAME MILIEU THE SAME CHEMICAL MILLOU THE SAME ENVIRONMENT AS ACTUAL PHYSICALLY ENGAGING IN THE BEHAVIOR THE SKILL THE RESISTANCE TRAINING ET CETERA AND I BE WILLING TO WAGER THAT THE SAME IS TRUE FOR EXPERIENCES OF ALL KINDS YOU KNOW A P T S T IS THIS INCREDIBLY UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANTE IN WHICH THERE'S A REPLAY OFTEN OF THE TRAMATIC EVENT THAT FEELS VERY REAL BUT THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THE REPLAY ITSELF IS THE SAME AS THE ACTUAL EVENT AND OF COURSE PTSTINI IS TO BE DEALT WITH O ITWITH THE UTMOST LEVEL OF SERIOUSNESS IT SHOULD BE TREATED A IN FACT MY LAB WORKS ON THESE SORTS OF THINGS BUT MY POINT ABOUT VISUALIZATION AND IMAGINING SOMETHING NOT BEING THE SAME AS THE ACTUAL EXPERIENCE IS GROUNDED IN THIS IDEA PROPRIATE CEPTION AND THE FACT THAT FEED BACK TO THE CERABELLUM THE CEREBELLUM TALKING OTHERAIRS OF THE BRAIN ARE CRITICALLY INVOLVED IN COMMUNICATING TO THE REST OF OURNERVOUS SYSTEM THAT NOT JUST THAT WE BELIEVE SOMETHING IS HAPPENING BUT SOMETHING IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING AND IN THE CASE OF MUSCLE LOADS MUSCLES ACTUALLY B FEELING TENSION THE ACTUAL FEELING OF TENSION IN THE MUSCLE THE CONTRACTING OF THE MUSCLE UNDER THAT TENSION IS PART OF THE IMPORTANT ADAPTATION PROCESS AND A FUTURE EPISODE WILL TALK ABOUT HYPERTROPHE AND HOW THAT WORKS AT THE LEVEL OF UPPER MODERNERONS LOWER MORNERONS AND MUSCLE ITSELF BUT FOR NOW JUST KNOW THAT VISUALIZATION CAN WORK DOESN'T WORK AS WELL AS REAL PHYSICAL TRAINING AND PRACTICE BUT ON THESE EFFACTS OF YOU KNOW THIRTY FIVE PER CENT OR THIRTEEN POINT FIVE PER CENT INCREASES ARE PRETTY CONSIDERABLE THERE JUST NOT AS GREAT AS THE FIFTY THREE PER CENT INCREASES THAT COME FROM ACTUAL PHYSICAL TRAINING FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE INTERESTED IN SOME OF THE SKILL LEARNING THAT MORE RELATES TO MUSICAL TRAINING BUT ALSO HOW CADENCE AND METRONOMING AND TONES ET CETERA CAN SUPPORT PHYSICAL LEARNING F YOUR INTERESTION THAT YOU PHISIONATOS THE THERE IS A WONDERFUL REVIEW ALSO PUBLISH IN THE JOURNAL NURON AN EXCELLENT JOURNAL BY HERHOLTS AND ZATORE THAT'S H RE H O L Z AND ZATORE Z A T O R R E THAT A REALLY DESCRIBES IN DETAIL HOW MUSICAL TRAINING CAN IMPACT ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS AND HOW CADENTS TRAINING A WHETHER NOT WITH TONES OR AUDITORY FD BACK THINKS THAT SORT CARRIES OVER TO  NOT JUST A INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC TRAINING BUT ALSO PHYSICAL SKILL LEARNING OF VARIOUS KINDS SO IF YOU WANT TO DO THE DEEP DIVE THAT WOULD BE THE PLACE ARE YOU CAN FIND IN EASILY ON LINE ITS AVAILABLE AS A COMPLETE ARTICLE FREE OF CHARGE ET CETERA MANY OF YOU ARE PROBABLY ASKING WHAT CAN I TAKE IN ORDER TO ACCELERATE SKILL LEARNING WELL THE CONDITIONS ARE GOING TO VARY BUT MOTIVATION IS K YOU HAVE TO SHOW UP TO THE TRAINING CESSION MOTIVATED ENOUGH TO FOCUSS YOUR ATTENTION AND TO PERFORM A LOT OF REPETITIONS IN THE TRAINING SEQUENCE THAT'S JUST A PREREQUISITE RIGHT THERE'S NO PILL THAT'S CAN ALLOW YOU TO DO FEWER REPETITIONS AND EXTRACT MORE LEARNING AT A FEWER REPETITIONS IT'S ACTUALLY MORE QUESTION OF WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS THAT YOU CAN CREATE FOR YOURSELF SUCH THAT YOU CAN GENERATE MORE REPETITIONS PER UNIT TIME I THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT WHAT WHAT IT ARE THE CONDITIONS THAT YOU CAN CREATE FOR YOURSELF IN YOUR MIND IN YOUR BODY THAT ARE GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO POCUS AND I'VE TALKED ABOUT PHOCUS AND PLASTICITY IN MOTIVATION IN PREVIOUS EPISODES PLEASE SEE THOSE EPISODES IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT I DETAIL LOT OF TOOLS AND THE UNDERLYING SIENCE SO FOR SOME PEOPLE IT MIGHT BE DRINKING A CUP OR TWO A COFFEE IND GETTING HYDRATED BEFOR THE TRAINING SESSION FOR SOME OF YOU IT MIGHT BE AVOIDING COFFEE BECAUE IT MAKES YOU TO GITERY IN YOUR ATTENTION JUMPS ALL OVER THE PLACE 'S GON A VERY TREMENDOUSLY THERE'S NO REAL THAT THERE IS NO MAGIC PILL THAT'S GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO GET MORE OUT OF LESS THAT'S JUST NOCKIN A HAPPEN IT'S SIMPLY NOK IN A HAPPEN YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET MORE LEARNING AT OF FEWER REPETITIONS OR LESS TIME HOWEVER THERE ARE A FEW COMPOUNDS I THINK WORTH ARE WORTH MENTIONING BECAUSE OF THERE ABILITY TO IMPROVE THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE THE ACTUAL EXECUTION OF CERTAIN TYPES OF MOVEMENTS AND SOME OF THESE HAVE ALSO BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE COGNIVE FUNCTION ESPECIALLY IN OLDER POPULATION SO I BE RE MISS IVE I DIDN'T AT LEAST MENTION THEM I'MONLY CON O MENTION ONE TO DAY IN FACT THE ONE THAT'S PARTICULARLY INTERESTING AND FOR WHICH THERE REALLY ARE A LOT OF DATA IS ALPHAG P C AND I'M GOING TO ATTEMPT TO A PRONOUNCE WHAT ALPHAG P C ACTUALLY IS ITS ALPHA GLEICERO PHOSPHO COLING RIGHT ALPHAG P C ALPHA GLEICEROPHOSPHO COLING SEE IF I KEEP DOING I OVER AND OVER REPETITIONS ALPHA GLOSEROPHOSPHO COLING AH THERE I MADE AN ERROR O K SO THE POINT IS THAT ALPHAG P C WHICH IS AT LEAST IN THE UNITED STATES IS SOLD OVER THE COUNTER TYPICALLY IS TAKEN IN DOSAGE IS OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED OR SIX HUNDRED MILIGRAMS AM THAT'S A SINGLE DOSE OR A HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO DO A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT FOR SOME OF YOU MIGHT BE BENEFICIAL AM ONE IS TO ENHANCE POWER OUTPUT SO IF YOUARE ENGAGING IN SOMETHING LIKE SHOT PUT THROWING OR RESISTANCE TRAINING OR SPRINTING OR SOMETHING WHERE YOU HAVE TO GENERATE A LOT OF POWER MAYBE UR DOING ROCK CLIMBING BUT YOUR WORKING ON A PARTICULAR ASPECT OF YOUR ROK CLIMBING THAT INVOLVES GENERATING A LOT OF FORCE A LOT OF POWER WELL THEN IN THEORY ALPHAG P C COULD BE BENEFICIAL TO YOU FOR THE COGNIVE EFFECTS THE DOSAGES ARE MUCH HIGHER A UPTO TWELVE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS DAILY DIVIDE INTO THREE DOSES OF FOUR HUNDRED MILIGRAMS IS WHAT THE STUDIES THAT I WAS ABLE TO FIND SHOW OR USED THE EFFECTS ON COGNIVE DECLINE ARE DESCRIBED AS NOTABLE NOTABLE MEANING SEVERAL STUDIES SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT BUT MODEST EFFECT ON IN OFFSETTING COGNIVE DECLINE IN PARTICULAR IN OLDER POPULATIONS AND SOME POPULATIONS EVEN WITH SOME A REPORTED NOR DEGENERATION POWER OUTPUT WAS NOTABLE HOW NOTABLE WHAT IS THAT MEAN NOTABLE AM A STUDY NOTED A FOURTEEN PER CENT INCREASE IN POWER OUTPUT AM THAT'S PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL IN A FOURTEEN PER CEN NT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT BUT IT WASN'T LIKE A DOUBLING OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT BELIEVE IT ARE NOT THE SYMPTOMS OF ALSHIMERS HAVE BEEN SHOWN AT LEAST AMONG THE NEUTROSUTICLES OF WHICH ALPHAG P C IS TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE COGNITION AND PEOPLE DALCIMERS NOW THIS EPISODE ISN'T ABOUT COGNIVE DECLINE AND LONGEVITY WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT BUT THIS IS A ASO CALLED AANOTHER EFFECT OF ALPHAG P C FADOXIDATION IS INCREASED BY ALPHAG P C GROWTHHORMON RELEASE IS PROMOTED BY ALPHAG P C ALTHOUGH TO A SMALL DEGREE SO AS YOU CAN SEE THINGS LIKE ALPHAG P C IN PARTICULAR WHEN THEY ARE COMBINED WITH LOW LEVELS OF KAFFINE CAN HAVE THESE EFFECTS OF IMPROVING POWER OUTPUT CAN IMPROVE GROWTHHORMON RELEASE CAN IMPROVE FATOXIDATION ALL THESE THINGS IN THEORY CAN SUPPORT SKILL LEARNING BUT WHAT THEYRE REALLY DOING IS THERE ADJUSTING THE FOUNDATION UPON WHICH YOU ARE GOING TO EXECUTE THESE MANY MANY REPETITIONS OKI THE SAMETHING WOULD BE SAID FOR KAFINE ITSELF IF THATS SOMETHING THAT MOTIVEATES YOU AND GETS YOU OUT OF A CHAIR TO ACTUALLY DO THE PHYSICAL TRAINING THEN THAT SOMETHING THAT CAN PERHAPS INPROVE OR ENHANCE THE RATE OF SKILL LEARNING AND HOW WELL YOU RETAIN THOSE SKILLS NOW ON A PREVIOUS EPISODE I TALKED ABOUT AND THIS WAS THE EPISODE ON APINEFRON ON A DRENALIN I TALKED ABOUT HOW FOR MENTAL FOR COGNITIVE LEARNING IT MAKE SENSE TO SPIKE EPINEFERON TO BUMP EFERANEFERENT LEVELS UP A DRENLA LEVELS UP AFTER COGNIT OFE LEARNING FOR PHYSICAL LEARNING IT APPEARS TO BE THE OPPOSITE THAT IF YOU ARE IF KAFFINE IS IN YOUR PRACTICE OR IF YOU DECIDE TO TRY ALPHAG P C THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO DO THAT BEFORE THE TRAINING TAKE IT BEFORE THE TRAINING USE IT ITS EFFECT SHOULD EXTEND INTO THE TRAINING PRESUMENTLY THROUGHOUT AND THEN AFTERWARD IF YOURE THINKING ABOUT FALLOWING SOME F THE PROTOCALS O WE DISCUSS TO DAY THAT YOU WOULD USE SOME SORT OF IDLE TIME WHERE THE BRAIN CAN REPLAY THESE MOTOR SEQUENCES IN REVERSE AND THEN OF COURSE YOU WANT TO DO THINGS THO OPTIMIZE YOUR SLEEP A LOT O THE QUESTIONS I GET ARE ABOUT HOW DIFFERENT PROTOCALS AND THINGS THAT I DESCRIBE START TO COLLIDE WITH ONE ANOTHER SO LETS SAY FOR INSTANCE YOU GO TO BED AT TEN THIRTY AND YOU'RE GOING TO DO YOUR A SKILL TRAINING AT NINE THIRTY WELL TAKING LOT OF KAFFINE THEN IS NOT ING TO BE GOOD IDEA CAUSE IT'S GOING TO COMPROMISE YOUR SLEEP SO I'M NOT OM HERE TO DESIGN THE PERFECT SCETTUAL FOR YOU BECAUSE EVERYONE SITUATIONS OFARY SO THE THINGS TO OPTIMIZE ARE REPETITIONS FAILURES MORE REPETITIONS MORE FAILURES AT THE OFFSET OF TRAINING HAVING SOME IDLE TIME THAT COAN BE STRAIGHT INTO SLEEP OR IT COULD BE SIMPLY LETTING THE BRAIN JUST GO IDLE FOR FIVE TO TEN MENS ME NOT FOCUSSING ON ANYTHING NOT SCROLLING SOCIAL MEDIA NOT EMAILING NOT  IDEALLY NOT EVEN TALKING O SOMEBODY JUST LYING DOWN OR SITTING QUIETLY WITH YOUR EYES CLOSE LETTING THOSE MOTOR SEQUENCES REPLAY THEN WE TALKED ABOUT HOW ONE CAN COME BACK FOR ADDITIONAL TRAINING SESSIONS USE THINGS LIKE METRONOMING WERE YOUR CUING YOUR ATTENTION TO SOME EXTERNAL CUE SOME STIMULUS IN THIS CASE IN AUDITORY STIMULUS MOST LYCLY AN TRYING TO GENERATE MORE REPETITIONS FOR UNITTIME SO AGAIN ITS REPETITIONS IN ERRORS THAT'S KEY AND THEN WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT SOMETHINGS THAT YOU CAN DO INVOLVING CERABELLAR NEROPHYSIOLOGY TO EXTEND RANGE OF MOTION IF THAT'S WHAT'S LIMITING FOR YOU OR TO USE VISUALIZATION TO AUGMENT THE PRACTICE OR LET SAY A YOUR PARTICULAR SKILL INVOLVES NICE WEATHER AND IT'S RAINING ARE SNOWING OUTSIDE AND YOU CAN'T GET OUTSIDE AN THUNDERSTORM THEN THAT'S WHERE VISUALIZATION TRAINING MIGHT BE A GOOD REPLACEMENT UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS OR IN MOST CASES GOING TO BE THE KIND OF THING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO WON TO DO INADDITION TO THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL SKILL OR STRENGTH TRAINING SESSION DONE AT LEAST IN THE STUDY THAT WE DESCRIBE FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES A DAY FIVE DAYS A WEEK OVER A PERIOD OF TEN TO TWELVE WEEKS OR SO SO WHOFULLY THAT MAKES IT CLEAR TODAY WE'VE COVERED A LOT OF MECHANISM WE TALK SO MUCH ABOUT THE DIFFERENT MOTOR PATHWAYS CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATORS SO YOU NOW ARE ARMED WITH A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT HOW YOU GENERATE MOVEMENT AND I LIKE TO THINK THAT YOU'RE ALSO ARMED WITH A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO DESIGN PROTOCALS THAT ARE OPTIMIZE FOR YOU OR IF YOU'RE COACH FOR YOUR A FOR YOUR TRAINEES IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE THEIR LEARNING OF SKILLS OF VARIOUS KINDS TO DAY WE FOCUS ALMOST ENTIRELY ON MOTOR SKILLS THINGS LIKE MUSICAL SKILLS AR PHYSICAL SKILLS THESE HAVE SOME OVERLAP THEIRE PARTIALLY OVERLAPPING WITH NEURAL PLASTICITY FOR LEARNING THINGS LIKE LANGUAGES OR MATH OR ENGINEERING OR NURAL SCIENCE FOR THAT MATTER BEFORE WE DEPART I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I RETURN TO A CONCEPT WHICH IS THE UL TRADY IN CYCLE ALL TRADIN IN CYCLES OF THESE NINETY MINUTE CYCLES THAT WE GO THROUG THROUGHOUT SLEEP IN WAKEFULNESS THAT ARE OPTIMUL FOR LEARNING AND ATTENTION IN THE WAKING STATE THERE THEY ARE THE STAGES OF A IN WHICH OF SLEEP IN WHICH WE HAVE EITHER PREDOMINALLY SLOWLY SEEPER REMSLEEP SOME OF YOU WHO HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS PODCAS FOR WHILE MIGHT BE ASKING WELL SHOULD AF PHYSICAL PRACTICE BE NINETY MINUTES THAT'S GOING TO DEPEND BECAUSE WITH PHYSICAL PRACTICES OFFEN TIMES FOR INSTANCE WITH STRENGTH TRAINING THAT MIGHT BE TOO LONG YOU'RE NOT CAN BE ABLE TO GENERATE ENOUGH FORCE OUTPUT FOR IT TO BE WORTH WHILE FOR GOLFING I DON'T KNOW OF NERVE PLAYGOLF ATHOUGH MY FRIENDS THAT PLAGOLF THEY DISAPPEAR UNDER THE GOLF COURSE FOR MANY HOURS SO I KNOWTHER'S LOT A WALKING AND AND DRIVING AND YOU KNOW OTHER STUFF EVEN HERE THAT SOMEBODY CARRIES YOUR STULF AROUND FOR YOU OM SOME TIMES NOT ALWAYS BUT YOU KNOTE IT'S GOING TO DIFFER YOU KNOW AN A FOUR HOUR GOLF GAME YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT SWINGING THE GOLF CLUB FOR FOUR HOURS SO IT'S GOING TO DEPEND I WOULD SAY THAT THE ALTRADIAN CYCLE IS NOT NECESSARILY A GOOD CONSTRAINT FOR SKILL LEARNING IN MOST CASES AND I SHOULD SAY THAT FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE SHORT ON TIME OR HAVE LIMITED AMOUNTS OF TIME TEN MINUTES OF MAXIMUM REPETITIONS MAXIMUM FOCUS SKILL LEARNING WORK IS GO ING TO BE VERY BENEFICIAL WHEREAS TOO HOURS OF KIND OF HAPHAZARD NOT REALLY FOCUSD TO WORK I'M OR WHERE YOU'RE NOT GENERING VERY MANY REPETITIONS CAS YOU DOING A FOR FEW REPETITIONS THAN YOUR TEXTING ON YOUR PHONE OR PAY INTENTIONS SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE BENEFICIAL IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE DENSITY OF TRAINING INSIDE OF A SECTIONS I THINK YOU SHOULD LET THE YOUWORK TOWARD MAXIMUL OR NEAR MAXIMAL DENSITY OF REPETITIONS AND FAILURES PROVIDED THEIR FAILURES YOU CAN PERFORM SAFELY IN ORDER TO ACCELERATE SKILL LEARNING AND DON'T LET SUM ARBITRARY OR IN THIS CASE THE ALL TRADI AND CONSTRAINT A PREVENT YOU FROM ENGAGING IN THAT PRACTICE IN OTHER WORDS GET THE WORK AND GET AS MUCH WORK DONE AS YOU CAN PER UNIT TIME AND BASED ON THE SCIENTS BASED SOMETHINGS THAT I'VE SEEN BASED ONTHINGS THAT I'M NOW INVOLVED IN WITH VARIOUS COMMUNITIES YOU WILL SEE THE SKILL IMPROVE VASTLY AT VARIOUS STAGES SOMETIMES IT'S ELILBIT STUTTER START IT'S NOT ALWAYS A LINGER A IMPROVEMENT BUT YOU WILL SEE INCREDIBLE IMPROVEMENT AND SKILL IF YOU'RE ENJOIN THIS PODCAST AND YOUR FINDING THE INFORMATION INTERESTING AND OR OF USE TO YOU

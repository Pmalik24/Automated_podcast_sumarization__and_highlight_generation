WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LASCIENCE SCIENCE PACTO  RI AM INDRCUBERMAN AND ON A PROFESSOR OF NOROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICIN TO DAY MY GUEST IS DOCTOR EDY CHANG DOCTOR EDI CHANG IS THE CHAIR OF THE NUR SURGERY DEPARTMENT AT THE UNIVERSHE OE CALIFORNIA AT SAN FRANCISCO DOCTOR CHANG'S CLINICAL GROUP FOCUSSES ON THE TREATMENT OF MOVEMENT DISORDERS INCLUDING EPILEPSY HE IS ALSO A WORLD EXPERT IN THE TREATMENT OF SPEECH DISORDERS AND RELIEVING PARALYSIS THAT PREVENT SPEECH AND OTHER FORMS OF MOVEMENT AND COMMUNICATION INDEED HIS LABORATORY IS CREDITED WITH DISCOVERING WAYS TO ALLOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE FULLY LOCKED IN SYNDRUM THAT IS WHO CANNOT SPEEK OR MOVE TO COMMUNICATE THROUGH COMPUTERS AND AI DEVICES IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO OTHERS IN THEIR WORLD AND UNDERSTAND WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING TO THEM IT IS A TRULY REMARKABLE ACHIEVEMENT THAT WE DISCUSSED TO DAY IN ADDITION TO HIS DISCOVERIES ABOUT CRITICAL PERIODS WHICH ARE PERIODS OF TIME DURING ONE'S LIFE WHEN ONE CAN LEARN THINGS IN PARTICULAR LANGUAGES WITH GREAT EASE AS POSH TO LATER IN LIFE AND WE TALK ABOUT THE BASIS OF THINGS LIKE BYLINGUILLISM AND TRY LINGUILISM WE TALK ABOUT HOW THE BRAIN CONTROLS MOVEMENT OF THE VERY MUSCLES THAT ALLOW FOR SPEECH AND LANGUAGE AND HOW THOSE CAN BE MODIFIED OVER TIME WE ALSO TALK ABOUT STUTTER ND WE TALK ABOUT A NUMBER OF ASPECTS OF SPEECH AND LANGUAGE THAT GIVE INSIGHT INTO NOT JUST HOW WE CREATE THIS INCREDIBLE THING CALLED SPEECH OR HOW WE UNDERSTAND SPEECH AND LANGUAGE BUT HOW THE BRAIN WORKS MORE GENERALLY DOCTOR CHNG IS ALSO ONE OF THE WORLD LEADERS IN BYWENGINEERING THAT IS THE CREATION OF DEVICES THAT ALLOW THE BRAIN TO FUNCTION AT SUPERPHYSIOLOGICAL LEVELS AND THAT CAN ALLOW PEOPLE WITH VERY SYNDRUMS AND DISORDERS TO OVERCOME THEIR DEPHICITS SO IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO IS INTERESTED IN HOW THE BRAIN WORKS NORMALLY HOW IT BREAKS DOWN AND HOW IT CAN BE REPAIRED AND IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN SPEECH AND LANGUAGE READING AND COMPREHENSION OF INFORMATION OF ANY KIND TO DAY'S EPISODE OUGHT TO INCLUDE SOME INFORMATION OF DEEP INTEREST TO YOU DOCTOR CHANG IS INDEED THE TOP OF HIS FIELD IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING THESE ISSUES OF HOW THE BRAIN IN CODE SPEECH AND LANGUAGE AND CREATE SPEECH AND LANGUAGE AND AS I MENTION MOVEMENT DISORDERS AND EPILEPSY WE VEN TALK ABOUT THINGS SUCH AS THE QITOGENIC DIET THE FUTURE OF COMPANIES LIKE NURL LINK WHICH ARE INTERESTED IN BYWENGINEERING AND AUGMENTING THE HUMAN BRAIN AND MUCH MORE ONE THING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE IS THAT IN ADDITION TO BEING A WORLD CLASS NERL SCIENCE RESEARCHER AND WORLD CLASS CLINITION NURO SURGEON AND CHAIR OF NUR SURGERY DOCTOR ETI CHANG HAS ALSO BEEN A CLOSE PERSONAL FRIEND OF MIND SINCE WE WERE NINE YEARS OLD WE ATTENDED ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TOGETHER WE ACTLY HAD A SCIENCE CLUB WHEN WE WERE NINE YEARS OLD FOCUS ON A VERY PARTICULAR TOPIC  LEFT TO LISTENIN TO TO DAY'S EPISODE TO DISCOVER WHAT THAT TOPIC WAS AND WHAT MEMBERSHIP TO THAT CLUB REQUIRED THAT A SIDE DOCTOR CHANG IS AN ABSOLUTE FINON WITH RESPECT TO HIS SCIENTIFIC PROWESS THAT IS BOTH HIS RESEARCH AND HIS CLINICAL ABILITIES AND HEIS ONE OF THESE RARE INDIVIDUALS THAT WHENEVER HE OPENS HIS MOUTH WE LEARN BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROR MY TEACHING IN RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCASTS OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTOROLIKE DRINK WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS PLENTY OF SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM THE SO CALLED ELECTROLYTES AND NO SUGAR SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS IN YOUR BODY IN PARTICULAR TO THE FUNCTION OF YOUR NERVE CELLS ALSO CALLED NURONS IN FACT IN ORDER FOR YOUR NURONS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY ALL THREE ELECTROLIHTS NEED TO BE PRESENT IN THE PROPER RATIOS AND WE NOW KNOW THAT EVEN SLIGHT REDUCTIONS IN ELECTROLIKE CONCENTRATIONS OR DEHYDRATION OF THE BODY CAN LEAD TO DEPHISITES IN COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE ELEMENT CONTAINS A SCIENCE BACK TOLECTROLIKE RATIO OF ONE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS THAT ONE GRAM OF SODIUM TWO UNDER MILEGRAMS OF POTASSIUM AND SIXTY MILIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM I TYPICALLY DRINK ELEMENT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP IN ORDER TO HYDRATE MY BODY AND MAKE SURE I HAVE ENOUGH ELECTROLYTES AND WHILE I DO ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL TRAINING AND AFTER PHYSICAL TRAINING AS WELL ESPECIALLY IF I'AVE BEEN SWEADING LOT IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMENT DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE AGAIN THAT'S DRINK ELEMENT ELEEMENT DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMAN AND NOW FOR MY DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR EDD CHANG EDDY WELCOME I I ENTER GREAT TO BE HERE WITH YOU THIS HAS BEEN A LONG TIME COMING JUST TOOU I COME CLEAN WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER SINCE WE WERE NINE YEARS OLD BUT THN THERE WAS A LONG GAP IN WHICH WE DIDN TALK TO ONE ANOTHER I HEARD THINGS ABOUT YOU AND PRESUME WE I YOU HEARD A THING TO ABOUT MYFOR BETTER FOR WORSE AAND THEN WE RECONNECTED YEARS LATER WHEN I WAS A P H C STUDENT AND YOU WERE MEDICAL STUDENT WE LITERALLY RAN INTO EACH OTHER IN THE HALLS OF UNIVERSIY CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO WERE YOU 'RE NOW THE CHAIR OF NERVE SURGERY  IT ALL COMES FULL CIRCLE WHEN YOU WERE AT YOU SEE A S AF YOU WERE WORKING WITH MIK MERSONIK AND I KNOW THAT NAME MIGHT NOT BE FAMILIAR TO A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT ES AND A SOR SYNONYMOUS WITH NERRO PLASTICITY THE ABILITY OF THE BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM TO CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO EXPERIENCE SO FOR A LISTENERS I WOUD JUST LOVE FOR YOU TO I GIVE A BRIEF OVER VIEW OF WHAT YOU WERE DOING AT THAT TIME BECAUSE I FIND THAT WORK SO FASCINATING AND IT REALLY POINTS TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT CAN PROMOTE AND MAY BE HINDER OUR BRAINS ABILITY TO CHANGE OH WILL THAT'S FANTASTIC SO WE DID BOMPINTO EACH OTHER I SERANDIPITOUSLY BACK THEN AND AT THE TIME I WAS A MEDICALS TO YOU SE USA STUDYING WITH MY  MERCNIC IN PARTICULAR I WAS STUDYING HOW THE BRAIN I ORGANIZES WHEN YOU HAVE PATTERNS OF SOUND AND I AM PARTICULAR WE WERE STUDYING THE THE BRAIN OF RODANS IN TRY AN UNDERSTAND HOW DIFFERENT SOUND PATTERNS ORGANIZE THE FREQUENCY REPRESENTATION FROM LOW TO MIDDLE HIGH FRE QUENCY MAPS AN THE BRAINS OF BABY WROTENS AND WONE THINGS THAT I WAS VERY INTERESTIND WAS TRYING ER STAND OUT THE PATTERNS OF THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT LET SAY THE VOCALIZATIONS OF THE ENVIRONMENT THAT THE RATPUPS WERE RAISED IN WERE JUST THE NATURAL SOUNDS OF THE HEAR HOW THAT SHAPES THE STRUCTURE OF THE BROWN OF THE BRAIN AND ONE OF THINS WE DID WAS TO TRY AN EXPERIMENT WHERE WE RAISED SOME OF THESE RAT PUPS IN WHITE NOISE CONTINUOUS WHITE NOISE I WAS ESSENSIALLY MASKING ALL THOSE ENVIRONMENTAL SOUNDS AND WHAT WAS THE CONSEQUENCE OF ANIMALS BEING RAISED IN WHITE NOISE ANDVIRONMENT WELL ONE OF THINGS THAT WE DIDN'T EXPECT BUT WE FOUND WHICH IS QUITE STRIKING IS THAT THERE'S IS EARLY PERIOD IN BRAIN DEVELOPMENT WHERE WERE VERY SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE PATTERNS THAT WE HEAR OR SEE AND IN NURSINS RECALL THIS A CRITICAL PERIOD OR A SENSITIVE PERIOD AND WE HAVE THIS FOR OUR EYES BUT WE ALSO HAVE IT FOR OUR EARS AND OH ONE OF THE MOST STRIKING EXAMPLES OF THIS IS THAT ANY HUMAN CAN ESSENTIALY GROW UP IN A A CULTURE WHERE THEY HEAR DIFFERENT SPEECH SOUNDS FROM ONE LANGUAGE TO ANOTHER N INS LIKE AFTER A COUPLE OF YEARS YOU LOSE SENSITIVITY TE SOUNDS THAT ARE NOT PART OF YOUR NATIVE LANGUAGE AND YOU HAVE HIGH SENSITY FOR FOR THE LANGUAGES OF YOUR NATIVE CULTURE AND OM THAT'S PRETTY PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY THAT HUMAN BRAIN HAS THAT FLEXIBILITY YET AT THE SAME TIME HAS THAT SPECIALIZATION FOR LANGUAGE AND SO WE WERE TRYING TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE MODEL THIS FOR EXAMPLE AND ENRODENCS WHO OBVIOUSY DON'T SPEAK BUT WE'RE JUST UNDERSTANDING HOW SOUNDS AND ENVIRONMENTAL SOUNDS MODULATAN ORGANIZE THE AUDITORY QUARTEX AND ONE O THINGS THAT WE FOUND THAT WAS QUITE STRIKING WAS THAT IF YOU BASICALLY MASK ENVIRONMENTAL SOUNDS FROM THESE RAT PUPS THE CRITICAL PERIOD THIS SENSITIVE PERIOD WHERE IT'S OPEN TO PLASTICITY IT'S OPEN TO CHANGE IT'S OPEN TO REORGANIZATION THAT ACTUALLY THAT WINDOW CAN STAY OPEN MUCH MUCH LONGER IN IT AND IN ONE WAY IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT'S GOOD THING BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IT IT'S ALSO A A RETARDATION IT'S ACTUALLY ITSLOWED THE MATURATION OF THE AUDITOR QUARTEX IT WAS READY TO CLOSE WHEN THESE RAPUPS WERE REALLY YOUNG BUT BY RAISING THEM IN WHITE NOISE WE FOUND OUT THAT YOU COULD KEEP IT OPEN FOR MONTHS BEYOND THE TIME PERIOD THAT INNORMALLY CLOSES AND SO I THINK ONE OF THINGS IT TAUGHT ME WAS THAT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE GENETIC PROGRAMMING THI SPECIFIES SOME OF THIS SENSITIVE PERIOD BUT IT'S ALSO LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE SOUNDS THAT WE HEAR THAT HOW KEEP THAT WINDOW FOR THE CRITICAL PERIOD OPEN AND CLOSE IT'S FASCINATING AND I KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT TO MAKE A DIRECT LEAP FROM ANIMAL RESEARCHED A HUMAN RESEARCH BUT IF WE COULD SPECULATE A LITTLE BIT UM I CAN IMAGINE THAT SOME P OPLE GROW UP IN HOMES WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF SHOUTING AND A LOT OF INFLECTION I MAYBE PEOPLE ARE VERY VERBOS OTHERS GROW UP IN A HOME WHERE IT'S QUIETER AND MORE PEACEFUL AH SOME BEOLERGAN TO GOW UP IN CITIES ITS CAME BACK FROM NEW YORK CITY IS LIKE ALL NIGHT LONG THERE'S HONKING AND SIRENS AND NON STOP AND THEN I RETURN HERE WHERE IT'S QUITE QUIET AT NIGHT CAN WE IMAGINE THAT THE HUMAN BRAIN IS GOING TO BE SHAPED DIFFERENTLY DEPENDING ON WHETHER NOT WHEN IT GROWS UP IN ONE ENVIRONMENT OR ANOTHER AND WOULD THAT INTACT THEIR TENDENCY TO SPEAK IN A CERTAIN WAY AS WELL AS HERE IN A CERTAIN WAY WOULD WE KNOW ABOUT THAT WELL I I THINK THAT IT'S FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT'S REALLY CLEAR THAT THOSE SOUNDS THAT WE ARE EXPOSED TO FROM THE VERLVERY EARLIEST TIME EVEN IN UTERA IN THE WOMB WERE THE SOUND IS HEARING THE MOTHER OR FATHER OF FRIENDS AROUND WHILE IN THE WHOM ACTUAABLE INFLUENCE HOW THESE THINGS ORGANIZE AND UM AND SO THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE SOUNDS THAT WE HEAR CAN HAVE SOME INFLUENCE AND THOSE SOUNDS ARE GON A STRUCTURE THE WAY THAT THOSE NURL NETWORKS ACTUALLY LAY DOWN AND WELL FOREVER INFLUENCE HOW YOU HEAR SOUNDS AND SPEECH AND LANGUAGES IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST PROFOUND EXAMPLES OF THAT I GET A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE USE OF WHITE NOISE DURING SLEEP IN PARTICULAR PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW WHETHER NOT USING A WHITE NOISE MACHINE WERE A MACHINE OR A PROGRAMM THAT MAKES THE SOUND OF WAVES FOR INSTANCE IF IT ASSIST THERE INFANT AND SLEEPING IS IT GOING TO BE BAD FOR THEM BECAUSE IT'S FLOODING THE AUDITORY SYSTEM WITH A BUNCH OF ASSENTIALLY WHITE NOISE WERE DISORGANIZED NOISE WE HAVE AN ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION NOT YET I THINK THAT WHAT YOUARE ASKING IS REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION BECAUSE PARENTS ARE USING WHITE NOISE GENERATORS ALMOST UNIVERSALLY NOW AND FOR GOOD REASONS YOU KNOW IT IS HEART AH TO HAVE KITS UP AT NIGHT I'VE GOT THREE KITS OF MY OWN AND A WAS VERY TEMPTED TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO USE SOME OF THESE TOOLS SUCH AS SOOTH THEM AND GET THEM TO BED AND ESPECIALY WHEN I WAS LIKE SO TIRED AND EXHAUSTED AM BUT I THINK THAT THERE IS A COST YOU KNOW TO THINK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOU KNOW WE WERE NOT EXPOSED TO CONTINUOUS WHITE NOISE NATURALLY AM THERE IS A VALUE TO HAVING REALLY SALIENT STRUCTURE SOUNDS THAT ARE PART OF OUR NATURAL EVIRONMENT ACTUALLY HAVE THE BRAIN DEVELOPE NORMALLY SO A WHETHER OR NOT THAT HAS AN IMPACT YOU KNOW WHY YOU'RE SLEEPING IT'S NOT CLEAR I I DON'T THINK THAT THOSE STUDIES HAVE BEEN DONE WHAT WAS REALLY CLEAR WAS THAT IF YOU RAISE THESE MAYBE RATS IN CONTINUOUS WHITE NOISE NOT SUPERLOUD BUT JUST ENOUGH TO MASK THE ENVIRON MENTAL SOUNDS THAT THAT WAS ENOUGH TO KEEP YOU KNOW THE AUDITORY QUARTEXS THE PART OF THE BRAIN THAT HEARS AH IN THIS REALLY DELAYED STATE WHICH COUL ESSENTIALLY SLOW DOWN THE DEVELOPMENT MATURATION OF THE BRAIN IN ONE PROBABLY ASSUME THAT SLOWING THE MATURATION OF ARIAS OF THE BRAIN THER RESPONSIBLE FOR HEARING MIGHT Y UNDER SCORE MIGHT IMPACT ONE'S ABILITY TO SPEAK RIGHT BECAUSE ISN'T IT THE CASE THAT IF PEOPLE CAN'T HEAR THEY A SHALD HAVE A HARDER TIME ENUNCIATING IN IN HA PARTICULAR WAY S  I ARDIT NOT BE ABLE TO HEAR MY OWN VOICE A WOULD MY SPEECH PATTERNS CHANGE WELL I THINK PART OF IT IS THAT A OVER TIME WE DEVELOP SENSITIVITY TO THE VERY SPECIFIC SPEECH SOUNDS AN AT GIVEN LANGUAGE AND A THE SENSITIVITY IMPROFS AS WE HEAR MORE OR MORE OR MORE OF IT AND THEN ON THE OTHER HAND WE LOSE SENSITIVE EACH OTHER SPEECH SOUNDS FOR THE SAME TIME BUT IT'S PART OF THAT PROCESS WE ALSO HAVE A A SELECTIVITY AGAIN A SPECIALIZATION EVEND FOR THOSE SOUNDS A EVEN RELATIVE TO NOISE NOISY BACKGROUNDS AND THINGS LIKE THAT I I TEND TO THINK ABOUT IT LIKE WHAT IS THE SIGNAL TO NOISE RATIO AND SO THE BRAIN HAS IT'S OWN WAYSE OF TRYING TO INCREASE THAT SIGNAL TO NOISE RACIAL IN ORDERN MAKE IT MORE CLEAR PART OF THAT IS HOW WE HEAR AND HOW IT LAYS DOWN A FOUNDATION FOR THAT SIGNAL NOISE RATIO AND SO YOU CAN IMAGINE A CHILD THAT'S THAT'S RAISED CONTINUOUSLY AND WHITE NOISE WOULD BE REALLY DEPRIVED OF THOSE KIND OF SOUNDS THAT AR REALLY NECSSER FOR TO DEVELOPE PROPERLY SO I THINK WITH REGARD TO AM THOSE TOOLS FOR BABIES I THINK WE WE SHOULD STUDY WE SHOULD TRY TO UNDERSTAND THIS DEFINITIVELY I THINK WHAT WE SAW RONANCE WOULD TELL US THAT THERE IS POTENTIAL NOW THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT BUT AGAIN IT'S NOT REALLY CLEAR IF YOUR JUST USING AT NIGHT WHETHER I HAS THOSE EFFECTS ET'S THE CRITICAL QUESTION THAT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE ASKING IS DID YOU DECIDE TO USE A WHITE NOISE MACHINE OR NOT TO HELP KEEP YOUR ANY OYOUR THREE CHILDREN SLEEP WELL A I THINK THE SHORT ANSWERRS NOW I MAYI II OVERSEE THAT A LOT OF WORK THINKING AND WORK ON THIS AND THOUGHT ABOUT IT CAREFULLY BUT THERE ARE OTHER KINDS OF NOISE OR I KNEW WI WOILD IM CALL A NOISE OTHER SOUNDS THAT YOU CAN USE THAT CAN BE EQUALLY SOOTHING TO A BABY OH IT'S JUST THE WHITE NOISE HAS NO STRUCTURE AND WHAT IT'S DOING IS ESSENTIALLY MASKING OUT ALL OF THE NATURAL SOUNDS AND I THINK THE GOAL SHOULD REALLY BE ABOUT HOW DO WE WERE PLACE THAT WITH OTHER MORE NATURAL SOUNDS THAT STRUCTURE THE BRAIN IN THE WAY THAT WE WANT TO BE MORE HEALTHY WELL I KNOW THAT AFTER YOU FINISHED YOUR MEDICAL TRAINING YOU WENT ON TO WERE SPECIALIZE IN YOUR SURGERY IN NOT LAST I CHECK YOU SPEND YOUR MOST OF YOUR DAYS EITHER RUNNING OR LABORATORY OR IN THE CLINIC OR RUNNING THE DEPARTMENT AND YOUR CLINICAL WORK IN YOUR LABORATORY WORK IN VOLVES OFTEN REMOVING PIECES OF THE SKULL OF HUMANS AND GOING IN IN EITHER REMOVING THINGS OR STIMULATING NOR ONS OM TREATING VARIOUS AILMENTS OF DIFFERENT KINDS BUT YOURE MAINFOCAS THESE DAYS OF COURSE IS THE NERBIOLOGY OF SPEECH AND LANGUAGE AND SO FOR THOSE THAT AREN'T FAMILIAR COULD YOU PLEASE DISTINGUISH FOR US SPEECH VERSES LANGUAGE IN TERMS OF WHETHER NOT DIFFERENT BRAIN AREAS CONTROL THEM AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST IND HOW SPEECH AND LANGUAGE AND HEARING ALL RELATE TO ONE ANOTHER YE AND THEN WE'LL TALK A BIT ABOUT FOR INSTANCE EMOTIONS AND HOW FACIAL EXPRESSIONS COULD PLAY INTO THIS OR HAND ANGESTURES ET CETERA BUT FOR THAT THE UNINFORMED PERSON AND FOR ME TO BE QUITE A DIRECT WHAT ARE THE BRAIN AREAS THAT CONTROL SPEECH AND LANGUAGE WHAT WHAT ARE THEY REALLY AN ESPECIALLY IN HUMANS HOW ARE THEY DIFFERENT AMEN WE HAVE SUCH SOPHISTICATED LANGUAGE I'M COMPARED TO A NUMBER OF OTHER SPECIES WAT WHAT IS ALL THIS LANDSCAPE LOOK LIKE IN THERE YE WELL A THAT'S A FASCINATING QUESTION AND I'M AN AT JUST TRY TO CONNECT A COUPLE OF THE DOTS HERE WHAGE IS THAT IN THAT EARLIER WORK DURING MEDICAL SCHOOL I WAS DOING A LOT OF WHAT WE CALL NARROW PHYSIOLOGY PUTTING ALECTRODES INTO THE AUDITORY QORTECS AND UNDERSTANDING HOW THE BRAIN RESPONDS TO SOUNDS AND THAT'S HOW WE ACTUALLY MAPPED OUT THESE THINGS ABOUT THE SENSITIVITY TO SENSITIVE PERIODS THAT EXPERIENCE A WITH MIKE MERS AND IC AN THINKING ABOUT HOW PLASTOSEE IS REGULAING IN BRAIN AN PARTICULAR ABOUT HOW SOUND IS REPRESENTED BY BRAIN ACTIVITY WAS SOMETHING THAT IT WAS REALLY FORMEDET FOR ME AND BECAUSE I WAS A MEDICAL SOON WAS GOING BACK TO MY MEDICAL STUDIECE AM IT WAS THAT IN COMBINATION WITH SEEING SOME AWAKE BRAIN SURGERIES THAT OUR DEPARTMENT IS REALLY WELL KNOWN FOR O ONE OF MY MENTERS MICHBURGER REALLY PINEERED THESE METHODS FOR TAN CARE PATIENTS WITH BRAIN TO MER AND BE ABLE TO DO THESE SURGERIES SAFELY BY KEEPING PATIENTS AWAKE AND BY MAPPING OUT LANGUAGE SO THEYRE TALKING AND LISTENING IN YOUR  ASSOCIING CONVERSATION WITH THESE PATIENTS WILE THERE'S A PORTION OF THEIR SKULL REMOVED AD YOUAR STIMULATING OR IN SOME CASES REMOVING AREAS OF THEIR BRAIN IS THAT RIGHT THAT'S THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT AND THE ONLY THING OFF THERE IS IT'S NOT ESSENTIALLY IT'S IT IS JUST THAT THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CONVERSATION THAT I MIGHT HAVE WITH MY PATIENT IS UNDERGOING A WAKE BRAIN SURGERY IS THAT I CAN'T SEE THEIR FACE AND THEY CAN'T SEE MY FACE I WE ACT TO HAVE A STERIL A DRAPE THAT ACTUALLY SEPARATES THE OPERATING FIELD AND THEY'R LOOKING AND INTERACTING WITH OUR IN OUR PSYCHOLOGISTS BUT I CAN TALK TO THEM AND THEY CAN HEAR MY VOICE AND VICE VIRSIND ITS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT WAY OF HOW WE CAN PROTECT SOME OF THOSE AREAS ARE REALLY CRITICAL FOR LANGUAGE AT THE SAME TIME ACCOMPLISH MISSION OF GETTING THE SEIZURES UNDER CONTROL ARE GETTING A BRAIN TO MURMUR IT IS THAT BECAUSE OCCASIONALLY YOU'LL ENCOUNT ER A BRAIN AREA MAY BE YOUR STIMULATING YOUR CONSIDERING REMOVING THAT BRAIN AREA AND SUDDENLY THE THE A PATIENT WILL START STUDDERING OR WILL HAVE A HARD TIME FORMULATING A SENTENCE IS THAT IS THAT SENTIALLY WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR YOU LOOKING FOR UM REGIONS IN WHICH IT IS OCA OR NOT OKT TO PROBE EXACTLY SO THE FIRST THING THAT WE DO IS THAT WE USE A SMALL ELECTRICAL STIMULATOR TO PROBE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE ARES THAT WE THINK MIGHT BE A RELATED AND POURNT FOR LANGUAGE OR TALKING OR EVEN MOVEMENTS OF YOUR ARM AND LIKE THAT'S WHAT WE CALL BRAIN MAPPING AND WE USE A SMALL ELECTRICAL CURRENT THAT'S DELIVER IT THROUGH A PROBE THAT WE CAN JUST PUT IT EACH SPOT AND THE AIRES THAT WERE REALLY INTEREST IN ER OF COURSE THE AREAS THAT ARE RIGHT AROUND THE PART THAT IS PATHOLOGICAL THE PART THAT'S INJURE OR THE PART THAT HAS A BRAIN TURMOR THAT WE WANT TO REMOVE SO WE CAN APPLY THAT PROBE AND TRANSIENTLY MEANING TEMPORARILY ACTIVATED SO FURE STIMULATING THE PART OF THRINTHT CONTROLS THE HAND THE HAND WILMOVE AH IT WILL JERK SOMETIMES A PHYSI WILL BE MADE SOMETHING LIKE THAT A OTHER TIMES WHILE SOME ONE IS COUNTING OR JUST SAYING THE DAYS THE WE CAN CAN STIMULTE IN A DIFFERENT AREA THAT STOPS THEIR SPEECH ALTOGETHER THAT'S WHAT RECALL SPEECH ARESTE OR IF SOME ONE IS LOOKING AT PICTURES AND THEY'RE DESCRIBING THE PICTURES AND Y U STIMULANE PARTICULAR AREA THEY STOP SPEAKING OR THE WORDS STARE COMING OUT SLURRED OR THEY CAN'T REMEMBER THAT THE NAME OF THE OBJECT THAT THEY'RE SEEIN THE PICTURE THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WERE LISTNING REALLY CAREFULLY WHILE WE APPLY THAT A FOCAL STIMULATION THAT'S WHAT WE CALL BRAIN MAPPING T WHATE'ER SOME OF THEM WERE A SURPRISING OR MAYBE EVEN IF YOU WANT TO OFFER ONE OF THE MORE OUTRAGEOUS EXAMPLES OF THINGS THAT PEOPLE HAVE SUDDENLY DONE OR FAILED TO BE ABLE TO DO AS HA CONSEQUENCE OF THIS BRAIN MAPPING WELL I THINK THE THING TO ME THAT HAS BEEN THE MOST STRIKING IS THAT YOU KNOW SOME THESE AREAS YOU STIMULATE AND ALTOGETHER YOU CAN SHUT DOWN SOMEONE'S TALKING SO PERSON SAYS I WANTED TO SAY IT BUT I COULDN'T GET THE WORDS OUT AND EVEN THOUGH I'VE SEEN THIS THOUSANDS OF TIMES NOW IT'S STILL EXCITING EVERY TIME THAT I SEE IT BECAUSE IT'S IT'S EXCITING BECAUSE YOU'RE SEEING THE BRAIN IT'S A PHYSICAL ORGANIT'S PART OF THE BODY UM OUTSIDE OF THE VEINS ON TOP OF IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE AH A MACHINE BUT WHEN YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT N YOU FOLK LAVE CHANGE THE WAY IT WORKS AND YOU SEE THAT BECAUSE A PERSON CAN'T TALK ANY ONE YOU SAID I KNOW WHAT I WANT TO SAY BUT I COULDN'T GET TE WORDS OUT YOU'RE CONFRONTED WITH THIS IDEA THAT THAT THAT ORGAN IS THE BASIS OF SPEECH AND LANGUAGE AN WAY BEYOND THAT OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW FOR ALL THE OTHER FUNCTIONS WE HAVE FOR THINKING AND AN FEELING OUR EMOTIONS EVERYTHING SO THAT TO ME IS A CONSTANT REMINDER OF YOU KNOW AM THIS REALLY SPECIAL THING THAT THE BRAIN DOES WAS COMPUTE A SO MANY O THE THINGS THAT WE DO IN PARTICULAR IN THE ARA ROUND SPEECH AND LANGUAGE GENERATING WORDS SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY UNIQUE TO OUR SPECIES AM IS IS JUST EXTRAORDINARY TO SEE AGAIN EVEN THOUGH I'VE SEEN A THOUSANDS OF TIMES IT'S JUST HAVING THAT CONNECTION BECAUSE IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE MACHINE BUT IT IS DOING SOMETHING THAT IS QUITE COMPLICATED PRECISE AND REMARKABLE DOU EVER SEE EMOTIONAL RESPONSES FROM STIMULATION IN PARTICULAR ARIAS AND DO YOU EVER HERE OR SEE YOUR MOTIONAL RESPONSES THAT ARE ASSOCIATE WITH PARTICULAR TYPES OF SPEECH BECAUSE FOR IU FOR ITSIS CURSE WORDS ARE KNOWN TO THAT PEOPLE TORATS OFFIN WILL CURSE NOT ALWAYS BUT IT USE NAS THE LEFT TAXS ROTHER THEOCID BUT AM WHAT I LEARNED FROM A A COLLEAGUE OF OURS IS THAT I'M CURSEWORDS HAVE A CERTAIN STRUCTURE TO THEM THERE'S USUALLY A HEAVY A OR KIND OF A SHARP CONSONANT UP FRONT WRIHT THAT  ALOWAS PEOPLE AT LEAST AS IT WAS DESCRIBED TO ME TO HAVE SOME SORT OF EMOTIONAL RELEASE IT'S NOT A WORD LIKE MURMUR WHICH IT HAS A KIND OF A SOFT ENTRY HERE I'M NOT USING THE TI LANGUAGE AND IT YOU PIC YOUR FAVOURITE CURSE WORD OUT THERE FOLKS AN I CAN AND I SHOUT OUT ANY NOW OR SAYANY NOW BUT THAT CERTAIN WORDS HAVE A HAVE A STRUCTURE TO THEM THAT BECAUSE OF THE MOTOR PATTERNS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN IN SAYING THAT WORD YIT YOU COULD IMAGINE HAS AT AN EMOTIONAL RESPONSE UNTO ITSELF SO WHEN STIMULATING OR WHEN BLOCKING THESE DIFFERENT BRAINAREAS DOU EVER SEE PEOPLE GET ANGRY OR SAD OR HAPPY OR MORE RELAXED OH WELL A TDEFINITELY I'VE SEEN CASES WHERE YOU CAN IN VOKE ANXIETY STRESS AND I THINK THAT THER'RE ALSO AREAS THAT YOU CAN STIMULATE YOU CAN ALSO EVOKE AM THE OPPOSITE OF THAT SIR LIKE A CALM STATE I THINK THAT BRAINAIRY IS IS SLIGHTLY HYPERACTIVE IN YOU OR AT LEAST MORE THAN A THAN MAN ALL THE YEARS I'VE KNOWN YOU YOUE YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN AT LEAST EXTERNALLY A VERY CALM PERSON I'V ALWAYS FINDED MUSING THAT YOU WORK ON SPEECH AND LANGUAGE IN YO A VERY CALMING VOICE I A AND I'M BEING REALLY SERIOUS IDDING THAT THERE IS A HUGE VARIATION A RIGHT AN INTERMS OF HOW PEOPLE SPEAK IN THI THER HOW THE ACCENT WORDS ABSOLUTELY Y SO THERE ARE AREAS FOR EXAMPLE AM THE ORBITA FRONTIQUARTEX THAT WE SHOWED THAT IF YOU STIMULATE THERE THE ORBITAL FRONTOQUARTEX A PART OF THE BRAIN THAT'S ABOVE THE EYES THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT ORBITAL FRONTAL A MEANING IT'S ABOVE THE EYE OR THE ORBIT AND IN THE FRONTALO ITS SASSERIA WRIHT IN HERE AH IT HAS REALLY COMPLEX FUNCTIONS IT'S REALLY IMPORN FOR LEARNING AND MEMORY BUT ONE OF THINGS THAT WE OBSERVED AS WHEN YOU STIMULATE THERE PEOPLE TENDED TO HAVE AM A REDUCTION IN THEIR STRESS AND IT WAS VERY MUCH RELATED TO IT THEIR STATE OF BEING MEANING THAT IF SOME ONE WAS ALREADY KIND OF FEELING NORMAL  YOU STIMULATE THEIR DIDN'T DO MUCH BUT IF SOME ONE WAS IN A VERY ANXIOUS STATE IT ACTUALLY RELIEVE THAT AND THEN WE'VE SEEN THE QUARRELLERY OF THAT WHICH IS TRUE TOO WHICH IS THAT THERE ARE OTHER AREAS LIKE THE MIGDELA OR PARTS OF THE INSULA THAT IF YOU STIMULATE YOU CAN CAUSE AN ACUTE TEMPORARY AH ANXIETY A NERVOUS FEELING OR IF YOU SEMULA INSULA PEOPLE CAN HAVE AN ACUE FEELING OF DISGUST SO UM YOU KNOW THE BRAIN HAS DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS IN THESE DIFFERENT NOTES THAT HELP PROCESS THE WAY WE FEEL AH CERTAINLY I THINK THAT TO SOME DEGREE NEROR PSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS REFLECT AN IMBALANCE OF THE ELECTRICAL ACTIVITIES IN THESE AREAS UM ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS SOMETHING I WILL NEVER FORGET WAS TAKING CARE OF A YOUNG WOMAN WITH UNCONTROLLED SEIZURES A WE CALL THAT APILEPSY IT'S A MEDICAL CONDITION WERE SOME ONE HAS UN CONTROLLED ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY IN THE BRAIN SOMETIMES YOU CAN SEE THAT AS CONVULSIONS WHERE PEOPLE ARE SHAKING AND LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS THERE ARE OTHER KIND OF SEIZURES OF PEOPLE CAN HAVE WER THEY DON'T LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS BUT THEY CAN HAVE EXPERIENCES THAT JUST COME OUT O NOWHERE AND AS JUST AS A RESULT OF ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY COMING FROM THE BRAIN AND UM ABOUT SIX YEARS AGO I TOOK CARE OF A YOUNG WOMAN WHO WAS DAGNOST PSYCHIATRICALLY WITH ANXIETY TISORDER FOR SEVERAL YEARS IT TURNS OUT THAT IT WASN'T REALLY AN ANXIETY DISORDER WAS ACTUALLY THAT SHED UNDERLYINE SEIZURES AN APILEPSY ACTIVATING APART OF HER BRAIN THAT EVOKES YOU KNOW ANXIOUS FEELINGS HOW DID HOW WAS THAT DISCOVERED BECAUSE I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE OT THEIR HAVE ANXIETY OF  YAH IN THE ABSENCE OF A BRAIN SCAN UM HOW OR WHY WOULD ONE SUSPECT THAT MAYBE THEY HAVE A A TUMORR OR SOME OTHER UM CONDITION THAT WAS CAUSING THOSE NEROMS O BECOME HYPRAYET THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE ANXIETY AND THE VAST PAST MAJORITY OR NOT HAVING THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE HAVING SEIZURES IN THE BRAIN II THINK ONE OF HTHE WAYS THAT THIS WAS DIGNOSE WAS THAT UM THE NATURE OF WHENC SHE WAS HAVING THESE PANIC ATTACKS WAS NOT TRIGERED BY ANYTHING THEY WOULD JUST HAPPEN SPONTANEOUSLY THAT'S WHAT CAN HAPPEN WITH SEIZURES SOMETIMES THEY JUST COME OUT OF NOWHERE WE DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAN WHAT CONTRIGER THEM BUT THEY WEREN'T THINGS THAT WERE TYPICALLY ANXIETY PROVOKING THIS IS SOMETHING T JUST HAPPENED ALL OF A SUDDEN AND BECAUSE YOU BROUGHT IT UP THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN SEE ON AN EMORIN WE CAND NOT SEE AND LOOK AT THE STRUCTURE OF HER BRAIN WITH AN EMORI THAT SHE WAS HAVING SEIZURES THE ONLY WAY THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY PROVE THIS WAS ACTUALLY PUTTING ELECTRODES A INTO HER BRAIN AND PROVING THAT THESE A TAXIS SHE WERE HAV SHE WAS HAVING WERE LOCALIZED TO PART CALLED THE MIGDELA IT'S A MEDIAL PART OF THE TEMPORAL OPE WHICH IS HERE AND I'M ASSOCIATING THE ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY THAT WERE SEEING ON THOSE ELECTROTES WITH THE SYMPTOMS AS SHE SHE HAD AND SHE ULTIMATELY NEEDED A KIND OF SURGEY WHERE SHE WAS AWAKE I'M IN ORDER TO REMOVE THIS SAFELY SPEAKING OF EPILEPSY A NUMBER PEOPLE OUT THERE HAVE EPILEPSY OR NO PEOPLE WHO DO ARE THE DRUGS FOR EPILEPSY I'M SATISFACTORY YOU KNO THINK O BOT THINGS LIKE DEPICOT YOU HAVE KNOWIN ADJUSTING THE EXCITATION AND AND HIBITION OF THE BRAIN OR MEN ARE THER GOOD DRUGS FOR EPILEPSY WE KNOW THERE ARE NOT GREAT DRUGS FOR A LOT OF OTHER CONDITIONS BUT IM AND HOW OFTEN DOES ONE NEED NURROW SURGERY A IN ORDER TO TREAT EPILESYR CAN TO BE TREATED THE MOST OFTEN JUST USING PHORMACOLOGY YO GREAT QUESTION WELL I'M A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SEIZURES THAT CAN BE COMPLETELY CONTROLLED BY THEIR MEDICATIONS A LOT  BUT THERE'S ABOUT ONE THIRD OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE EPILEPSY WHICH WE DEFINE AS ANYONE WHO'S HAD THREE OR MORE SEIZURES 'M THAT YOU KNOW ABOUT A A THIRD OF THEM ACTUALLYS DON'T HAVE CONTROL WITH ALL OF THE MODERN MEDICATIONS THAT WE HAVE NOWADAYS AND SOME OF THE DAYTO SUGGEST THAT IF YOU HAVE TWO OR THREE MEDICATIONS  ACTION DOESN'T MATTER NECESSARILY WHICH OF THE ANTISEISURE MEDICATIONS IT IS BUT THERE IS DAYTO SUGGEST IF YOU'VE JUST TRI TWO OR THREE THE FOURTH FIFTH SIX IN BEYOND IT'S NOT LIKELY TO HELP CONTROL IT SO I'M WE ARE IN A SITUATION ON FORTUNATELY WERE A LOT O THE MEDICATIONS ARE GREAT FOR SOME PEOPLE BUT FOR ANOTHER SUBSET THEY CAN'T CONTROL IT AND IT COMES FROM A PARTICULAR PART OF THE BRAIN NOW FORTUNATELY IN THAT SUB SET THERE'S ANOTHER PART OF THAT THAT GROUP THAT CAN BENEFIT FROM A SURGERY THAT ACTUALLY EITHER REMOVES THAT PART OF THE BRAIN AND NOWADAYS WILL US STIMULATORS NOW TO 'M SOMETIMES PUT ELECTRICAL STIMULATION IN THAT PART OF THE BRAIN TO HELP RODUCE TO SEZURS AND YOU SAID A THIRD OF PEOPLE WITH EPA EPILEPSY MIGHT NEED NER A SURGERY WELL WHAT I WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS LIKE THEY CONTINUE TO HAVE SEIZURES THAT ARE NOT CONTROLLED BY ALL MEDICATIONS AND THERE'S CAN BE ANOTHER SUBSET OF THOSE THAT I MAY BENEFIT FROM A SURGERY IT'S PROBABLY NOT THAT WHOLE THIRD IT'S A SUBSET OF THAT IT'S JUST TO SAY THAT EPILEPSY CAN BE REALLY HARD TO GET FIXED AND I FOR PEOPLE WERE THE SEIZURES COME FROM ONE SPOT ER YOU KNOW AN AREA THEN SURGERY CAN DO GRAT IF IT COMING FROM IF IT COMES FROM MULTIPILAREAS IF IT COMES FROM THE WHOLE BRAIN THEN WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT OTHER METHODS TO CONTROL FORTUNALLY NOWADAYS ORSECXY OTHER WAYS 'M SURGERY NOW TO US DOESN'T JUST MEAN WERE MOVING BAE THE BRAIN AH HALF OF WHAT WE DO NOW IS USE STIMULATORS I MODULATE THE STATE OF THE BRAIN THAT CAN HELP RODUCE DESEIZURES I'VE HEARD BEFORE THAT THE QEITOGENIC DIET WAS ARIGINALLY FORMULATED IN ORDER TO TREAT EPILEPSY IN PARTICULAR IN KIDS IS THAT TRUE AND WHY WOULD BEING IN A KETOGENIC STATE WITH LOW BLOOD GLUECOSE REDUCE SEIZURES THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND I'M TO BE ON IS I DON'T KNOW ACTUALLY IF IT WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED TO TRE SEIZURES BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU FOR SURE THAT FOR SOME PEOPLE JUST LIKE WITH SOME MEDICATIONS IT IT CAN BE A LIFE CHANGING THING CAN COMPLETELY CHANGE THE WAY THAT THE BRAIN WORKS AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S FOR EVERYBODY BUT FOR SOME PEOPLE THERE'S NO QUESTION HAVE SOME VERY BENEFICIAL THE FACTS I THINK IT'S TO BE DETERMINED SI LIKE WHY WHY AND HOW THAT WORKS I'VE HEARD SIMILAR THINGS ABOUT THE KEYTOGENIC DIET FOR PEOPLE WITH ALSHEIMERS DOMENCIA THAT AM THERE'S NOTHING PARTICULARLY RELEVANT ABOUT KEYTOSE IS TWO ALSHEIMERS PER SAY BUT BECAUSE ALSHEIMERS CHANGES THE WAY THAT NERAUNTS METABOLIZE ENERGY THAT SHIFTING TO AN ALTERNAT FUUEL SOURCE CAN SOMETIMEAS MAKE PEOPLE FEEL BETTER AND SO AE NUMBER PEOPLE ARE NOW TRYING IT BUT IT'S NOT AS IF AM BLOOD GLUECOSE AND HAVING CARBOHYDRATES IS CAUSING ALL ALSHEIMERS AND PEOPLE GET CONFUSED OFTEN THAT AT JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING I CAN HELP DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE OPPOSITE AS IS HARMING A SOMEBODY SO THAT I FIND THIS REALLY INTERESTING A A SOMETIME A'LL CHECK BACK WITH YOU ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN TERMS OF A QEETOGENIC DIETS AN AN EPILEPSY BUT IT YOU SAID THAT IN SOME CASES IT CAN HELP AS THAT OBSERVATION BEEN MADE BOTH FOR CHILDERN AND FOR ADULTS BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT ORIGINALLY THE KEYTOGENIC DIET FOR EPILEPSY WAS REALLY FOR PEDIATRIC EPILEPSY YEH THAT'S RIGHT SO A LOT OF ITS FOCUS HAS REALLY BEEN ON KIDS AH WITH APILEPSY BUT CERTAINLY IT'S A SAFE THING TO TRY SO LOT OF ADULTS YOU KNOW WE'LL TRY IT AS WELL INTERESTING I'D LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE OF OUR SPONSORS ATHLETIC GREENS ATHLETIC GREENS NOW CALLED AG ONE IS A VITAMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT COVERS ALL YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AN TWELVE SO AM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THEREASON I STARRY TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS AND THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIC GREENS ONCE ARE USUALLY TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT GETS O ME THE PROBIATICS THAT I NEED FOR GOT HEALTH OUR GOD IS VERY IMPORTANT ITS POPULATED BY GOT MICROBIODA THAT COMMUNICATE WITH THE BRAIN THE IMMN SYSTEM AND BASICALLY ALL THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OF OUR BODY TO STRONGLY IMPACT OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TURN HEALTH AND THOSE PROBATICS ENOTHLETIC GREENS ARE OPTIMAL AND VITAL FOR MICROBIOTIC HEALTH IN ADDITION ATHLETIC GRENS CONTAINS A NUMBER OF ADAPTIGENS VITEMENS AND MINERALS THAT MAKE SURE THAT ALL MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS ARE MET AND IT TASTES GRIGHT IF YOU LIKE TO TRY ATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO AT LETTIT GREENS DOCK CALM SLSH HUBERMEN AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS THAT MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO MIX UP ATH LETIC GREENS WHILE YOU'RE ON THE ROAD IN THE CAR ON THE PLAIN ET CETERA AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU A YEAR SUPPLY OF VIT HIM IN D THREE K TOO AGAIN THAT'S THAT LETIT GREENSDOCK CAM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET THE FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEARS SUPPLY A VIT HIM INT THREE KA TO I'M CURIOUS ABOUT EPILEPSY A FOR ANOTHER REASON UM I WAS TAUGHT THAT EPILEPSY ISN'T IN BALANCE IN THE EXCITATION AN AN AMBITION IN THE BRANCEITHING BY THESE ELECTRICAL STORMS THEY GIVE PEOPLE EITHER GRANDMAL YOU KNOW SHAKING IN I CAN OF CONVULSI IN CONVULSIONS BUT YEARS AGO AS READING A BOOK A WONDERFUL BOOK ACTUALLY THE EINSTEIN IN LOVE BY DENNIS OVERBY IS ABOUT EINSTEIN IN HIS WERE UM I GUESS HIS PERSONAL LIFE BEN PEOPLE WHO KNEW HIM CLAIM THAT HE WOULD SOMETIMES WALK ALONG AND THEN EVERY ONE SOW I WOULD JUST STOP I CAN A STARE OFF INTO SPACE FOR ANYWHERE FROM A MINUTE TO THREER TO FIVE MINUTES AND IT WAS SPECULATED THAT HE HAD ABSENTE SEIZURES WHAT IS AN ABSENT SEIZURE AND THE REASON I ASK IS I A OCCASION WOULD BE WALKING ALONG AND I'LL ME THING ABOUT SOMETHINGAND I'LL STOP BUT I IN MY MIND I THINK I I'M THINKING DURING THAT TIME BUT I REALIZE THAT IF I WERE TO SEE MYSELF FROM THE OUTSIDE IT MIGHT APPEAR THAT I WAS JUST ABSENT WHAT IS AN ABSENT SEIZURE BECAUSE IT'S SO STRIKINGLY DIFFERENT IN ITS DESCRIPTION FROM SAY A GRANDMALL CONVULSIVE SEIZURE SIRE WELL UM LUCK I MENTION BEFORE DEPENDIN ON HOWL THE SEIZURE ACTIVITY SPREADS IN BRAIN OR HOW IT ACTUALLY PROPAGATES IF IT STAYES IN ONE PARTICULAR SPOT AND DOESN'T SPREAD TO THE ENTIRE BRAIN IT CAN HAVE REALLY DIFFERENT MANIFESTAZTION I CAN REPRESENT REALLY DIFFERENTLY T SO ABSOEN CEIZURES JUST ONE CATEGORY OF DIFFERENT KONOF SEIZURES WEARE IM YOU CAN LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS PACIC AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THAT YOU'RE NOT FULLY AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN VIREMENT O CASE OF YOUR SIRVE TAKEN OFF LYING TEMPORARILY FROM CONSCIOUSNESS BUT YOU COULD STILL BE FOR EXAMPLE STANDING AND TO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT PAY ANTENTION THEY MAY NOT EVEN BEAWARE BUT THAT'S HAPPENING WHAT ARE SOME OTHER TYPES OF SEIZURES WELL UM YOU KNOW I THINK SOME OF THE OTHER KINDS ARE THE CLASSIC ONES ARE TEMPORALOP SEIZURES SO THESE ARE ONES THAT COME FROM THE MEDIAL STRUCTURES LIKE THE MAKE OLI AND HIP I CAMPAS I OFTENTIMES PEOPLE WHEN THEY HAVE SEIZURES COMING FROM THAT THEY MAKE HASTE SOMETHING VERY AUNUSUAL LIKE A METALLIC TASTE OR SMELL SOMETHING LIKE THE SMELL OF BURNING TOASTS SOMETHING LIKE THAT IM THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WILL A WITH TEMPORAL OBSEIZURES WILL HAVE DE GAVOU THEY WILL HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE THAT YOU'VE BEEN SOMEWHERE BEFORE BUT A THAT'S JUST A PRECURSOR TO THE SEIZURE AND IT JUST HIGH LIGHTS THAT WHEN PEOPLE HAVE SEIZURES COMING FROM THESE AREAS THEY SOMETIMES HIGH JACK WHAT THAT PART OF THE BRAIN IS REALLY FOR SO THEY MAKE TOL A AND HYPPICAMPUS FORKS IM PARE REALLY IMPORN FOR LEARNING AND MEMORY IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT WHEN PEOPLE HAVE SEIZURES THERE THAT IT CAN INVOKE A FEELING OF DE SGAVOU OR THAT IT CAN INVOKE A FEELING OF ANXIETY AM AND AM AND THE AIREAS THAT ARE RIGHT NEXT TO IT FOR EXAMPLE A THESE AIRAS ARE REALLY IMBORN FOR PROCESSING A SMELL SO A THESE AIREAS ARE RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHERS YOU CAN HAVE THESE CONNUMT COMPLEX SET OF SYMPTOMS THE WEIR TASTE  ITSMELL OF TOST AND AN A FEELING  H DESA THAT'S CLASSIC FOR TEMPORAL OF SEIZURE AND IT'S BECAUSE THOSE PARTS BRAING THET PROCESS THOSE FUNCTIONS ARE RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER I'M TOLD THAT I'VE HAD NOCTURNAL SEIZURES AND I'VE WOKEN UP SOMETIMES FROM SLEEP HAVING FELT AS IF I WAS HAVING A CONVULSION THE OR SENSE OF BUZZING IN THE BACK ON THE HEAD IM S HAPPEN O ME TWO OR THREE TIMES IN COLLEGE MY GRIFFREN A WELL I WOKE UP IN MY GRIFFENWAS VERY DESTRAUGHT LIKE YOURE HAVING A SEIZURE OU AN FUL CONVULSION IN MY SLEEP A WHAT ARET IS THAT CORRECT AR THERE IS THERE SUCH A THING AS NOCTURNAL SEIZURES WHAT ARE THEY REFLECT THEY EVENTUALLY STOPPED HAPPENING AND I COULDN'T TETHER THEM TO ANY KIND OF LIFE EVENT I WASN'T DOING ANY AND A COMBATS BORT OR ANYTHING AT THE TIME I WASN'T DRINKING ALCOHOL MUCH IT'S NEVER REALLY BEEN MY THING A WHAT ARE NOCTURNAL SEIZURES ABOUT OH A WELL AND DO I NEED BRAINS A NOCTURAL SEIZURES ARE JUST ANOTHER FORM LIKE AGAIN APILOPSE IN SEIZURS CAN HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT FORMS AND A NOT JUST LIKE WHERE IN THE BRAIN BUT ALSO WHEN THEY HAPPEN AND THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO AH FOR WHATEVER REASON IT'S VERY TIME TO THE CIRCADIAN RHITHEM THERE'S UCY NOT JUST HAPPENING AT NIGHT BUT A CERTAIN PURIT A NIGHT WHEN PEOPLE ARE IN A CERTAIN STEECH OF SLEEP THAT THE BRAIN IS IN A STATE THAT IT'S VULNERABLE TATO HAVING A SEIZURE AND SO THAT'S BASICALLY IT JUST ONE FORM OF THAT AGAIN IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT WHERE IT'S COMING FROM BUT ALSO WHEN IT'S HAPPENING HOW THAT'S TIME WITH OTHER THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING WITH A BODY WELL IT EVENTUALLY STOPPD HAPPENINGS I'VE STOPPED WORRYING ABOT IT BUT I'M HAVEN HAD SEIZURE SINCE RETURNING TO SPEECH IN LANGUAGE A WHEN I WAS GETTING WEAND IN NEAR O SCIENCE I LEARNED THAT WE HAVE AN AREA OF THE BRAIN FOR PRODUCING SPEECH AND WE HAVE AN REA THE BRAIN FOR COMPREHENDING SPEECH WHAT'S THE STORY THERE IS IT STILL TRUE THAT WE HAVE A BROKEAS IN A VERNIKY'S AREA IM THOSE ARE NAMES OF NAUROLOGISTS PRESUMABLY OR NERS SURGENS THEY DISCOVER THSE DIFFERENT BRAIN AREAS AM MAYBE YOU COULD FAMILIARIZE US WITH SOME OF THE THE  SOR TEXTBOOK VERSION OF HOW SPEECH AND LANGUAGE ORE ORGANIZED IN THE BRAIN MAYBE SURE WITH US L A BIT OF THE LEISION STUDIES THAT LED TO THAT UNDERSTANDING ANDTHEN I WOULD LOVE TO HERE A BIT ABOUT WHAT YOUR LABORATORY IS DISCOVERING ABOUT HOW THINGS ARE ACTUALLY ORGANIZED BECAUSE FROM SOME DISCUSSIONS YOU AND I AVE HAD OVER THE LAST YEAR SO IT SEEMS LIKE WEL ETS JUST BE BLUNTE IT SEEMS THAT MUCH OF WHAT WE KNOW FROM THE TEXT BOOKS COULD BE WON WELL IM I I LOVE THAT QUESTION BECAUSE FOR ME IT'S VERY CENTRAL TO THE RESEARCH WE DO AND IT'S WOR THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN WHAT WE DO IND  LABORATORY IN OUR RESEARCH INTERFACES WITH WHAT I SEE IN PATIENCE AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT FASCINATED ME EARELLY ON IN MY MEDICAL TRAING WAS IN DOING SOME OF THESE BRAIN MAPPING ARE WATCHING THEM WITH MY MENTOR OR TAKING CARE OF PATIENCE AND HAD IN A BRAIN TIMERSON' STOWN PART OF THE BRAIN WAS THAT A LOT OF TIMES WHAT I WAS SEEN A PATIEN DID NOT QUARRELLY WITH WHAT I WAS TAUGHT IN MEDICAL SCHOOL AND YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE WILL THINK WELL O THIS MIGHT BE AN EXCEPTION BUT AFTER YOU SEE IT FOR A COUPLE TIMES IN IF YOU'R KIND INTERESTED IN THIS PROBLEM IT POSES A IN IT ITPOSES A SERIOUS CHALLENGE TO WHAT YOU'VE LEARNED AND HOW YOU THINK ABOUT HOW THES SINGS IM OPERATE AND THAT ACTUALLY GOT ME REALLY INTERESTED IN TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT BECAUSE EARLIER WE TALKED ABOUT JUST THIS EXTRAORDINARY THING THAT THE BRAIN IS DOING TO CREATE WORDS IN SENTENCES AND THAT'S THE PROCESS BY WHICH I'M GETTING IDEAS OUT FROM MY MIND INTO YOURS IT'S INCREDIBLE THING WRIGHT IT'S THE BASIS OF COMMUNCATION IM IM HI HIGH INFORMATION COMMUNICATIEN BETWEEN TWO INDIVIDUALS THIT'S REALLY UNIQUE TO HUMANS SO IN HIS IN HISTORICAL TIMES HOW THIS WORKS HAS BEEN VERY CONTROVERSU FROM DAY ONE OF NARROW SCIENCE IM LONG TIME AGO PEOPLE THOUGHT THE BUMPS ON YOUR HEAD CORRESPONDED TO THE DIFFERENT FACULTIES OF THE MIND SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAD A BUMP HERE MIGHT BE CORRESPONDING TO TELLIGANDS OR ANOTHER ONE OVER HERE YOU KNOW DIVISION AND THESE KIND OF THINGS IM THAT'S WHAT WA NOWADAYS CALL PHRENOLOGY AND IM THAT WAS KIND OF THE STARTING POINT  LOT OF THAT HAS BEEN OF COURSE DEBUNKED BUT WHEN YOU SEE THOSE LITTLE STATUES OF DIFFERENT BRAIN PARTITION ON SOMMONS EAD THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT HOW PEOPLE WERE THINKING ABOUT HOW THE BRAIN WORKD BACK THEN M CO A HUNDRED YEARS AGO MODERN NARROW SCIENCE BEGAN WHEN ACTUALLY WAS VERY MUCH RELATED TO THE DISCOVERY OF LANGUAGE SO MODERN NARROW SCIENCE MEANING MOVING BEYOND THIS IDEA THAT THE BOMPS ON THE SCALP CORRESPONDED TO THE FACULTIES OF MINE BUT THERE WERE THINGS THAT ACTUALLY WERE IN THE BRAIN THEMSELVES AND THEY WEREN'T CORRESPONDING TO THINGS T AT YOU COULD SEE SUPERFICIALLY LIKE ON THI CAL BOR IM EXTERNALLY THAT IT WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THE BRAIN ITSELF I MEAN IT SEEMS SO OBVIOUS NOW BACK THEN THIS WAS THE BIG ACADEMIC YOU KNOW DEBATE AND THE FIRST OBSERVATION THAT I THINK REALLY WAS REALLY IMPACKFUL AND IN THE AIRY OF LANGUAGE WAS N OBSERVATION BY A NERVS NERSURGEN A FRENCH NEROUSURGE NAME PIRBROKA IN WHAT HE OBSERVED WAS THAT A IN A PATIENT NOT THAT HE DID SURGERY BUT THAT HE HAD SEEN IN TAKING CARE OF THAT THE PERSON COULDN'T TALK AND IN PARTICULAR THEY CALLED THIS INDIVIDUAL TAN BECAUSE THE ONLY WORDS THAT HE COULD PRODUCE WAS TAN TAN FOR THE MOST PART HE COULD GENERALLY UNDERSTAND THE KIND OF THINGS THAT PEOPLE WERE ASKING ABOUT BUT THE ONLY THING THAT HE COULD UTTER FROM HIS MOUTH WORE THESE WORDS TAN TAN AND WHAT EVENTUALLY HAD HAPPENED WAS THIS INDIVIDUAL PASSED AWAY AND THE WAY THAT NURSCIENCE WAS DONE BACK THEN WAS BASICALLY TO WAIT UNTIL THAT HAPPENED AND THEN TO REMOVE THE BRAIN AND TO SEE WHAT PART OF THE BRAIN WAS AFFECTED IN THIS PATIENT THAT THEY CALLED TAN AND WHAT BOROK HAVE FOUND WAS THAT THERE WAS A PART IN THE LEFT FRONTOLOE SO THE FRONTALOBE IS HIS AERELIKE I DESCRIBE EARLIER WHICH IS YOU KNOW UP BEHIND OUR FOREHEADT UP HERE AND IN THE BACK OF THAT FRONTOLOE HE CLAIM THAT THIS WAS THE SEAT OF ARTICULATION IN THE BRAIN HE LITERALLY SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN FRONCE THE SEAT OF ARTICULATION MEANING THAT THIS IS THE PART OF THE BRAIN THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR US TOGENERATE WORDS ABOUT FIFTY YEARS LATER THE STORY BECOMES MORE COMPLICATED WITH A GERMAN NAROLOGIST NAMED CALL WERNICY AND WHAT WERNOKY DESCRIBED WAS A DIFFERENT SET OF SYMPTOMS IMPATIENCE THAT HE OBSERVED A DIFFERENT PHENOMENON WHERE PEOPLE COULD PRODUCE WORDS BUT A LOT OF THE WORD  THEY WERE FLUENT IN THE SENSE THAT THEY HAD LIKE AM THEY SOUND LIKE THEY COULD BE REAL WORDS BUT FROM A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE FOR EXAMPLE AND SOME OF US CALL THAT LIKE WORD SALAD OR JARGON IT'S ESSENTIAL THEY WERE ESSENTIALLY MAKING UP WORDS BUT IT WAS NOT INTENTIONAL IS JUST THE WAY THAT THE WORDS CAME OUT BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT HE OBSERVED THAT THESE PEOPLE ALSO COULD NOT UNDERSTAN WHAT WAS BEING SAID TO THEM SO AH YOU WE COULD BE HAVING CONVERSATION AND IG'T BE ASKING YOU A AM I WOMAN AND YOU MIGHT KNOT YOUR HEAD YOU KNOW JUST BECAUSE OU'RE NOT PROCESSING THE QUESTION YOU KNOW AND SO AM HERE TWO OBSERVATIONS ONE IS THAT THE FRONTOLOBE IS IMPORTANT FOR ARTICULATING SPEECH CREATING THE WORDS AND EXPRESSING THEM FLUEN LY AND THEN A DIFFERENT PART OF THE BRAIN CALLED THE LEFT TEMPOROLOPE WHICH IS IS AIRY RIGHT ABOVE MY EAR THAT IS AN AREA THAT I THINK WAS UM  CLAIM TO BE REALLY IMPORANT FOR UNDERSTANDING SO THE TWO MAJOR FUNCTIONS IN LANGUAGE TO SPEAK AND TO UNDERSTAND WE'RE KIND OF PIN DOWN TO THAT AND WE'VE HAD THAT BASIC IDEA IN THE TEXT BOOKS FOR YOU KNOW FOR TWO HUNDRED YEARS CERTAINLY WHEN I WAS TAUGHT IS THAT RIGHT O EVERY YE IT' CERTAINLY NO WHAT WE STILL WE STILL TEACH YOU UNDERGRADUATES GRADUATES INCE IN MEDICAL STUDENTS THAT WELL THAT'S WHAT I LEARNED TO A MEDICAL SCHOLL AND WHAT I SAW IN REALITY WHEN I SARE TAKING CARE OF PATIENTS WAS THAT IT'S NOT SO SIMPLE IM THE FACT PART OF IT IS FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG SO JUST IN A NUT SHELL NOWADAYS A AFTER NOW LOOKING AT THIS VERY CAREFULLY OVER HUNDREDS OF PATIENTS WE HAVE SHOWN THAT SURGERIES FOR EXAMPLE IN THE POSTURE PART OF THE FRONOLOPE ALOT TIMES PEL HAVE NO PROBLEM TALKING AT ALL AT ALL WHATSOEVER AFTER THOSE KINDOF SURGERIES AND THAT IT'S A DIFFERENT PART OF THE BRAIN THWE CALL THE PRECENTRAL GYRIS IM THE PRECENTRAL GYRIS IS A PART OF THE BRAIN THAT I IS INTIMATELY ASSOCIATED WITH E MOTOR QUARTEX THE MOTOR QARTEXTSS THE PART OF THE BRAIN HAS A MAP OF YOUR ENTIRE BODY SO THAT HAS A PART THAT CORRESPONDS YEURE FEET HAS A PART THAT CORRESPONDS T YOUR HANDS BUT THEN THERE'S ANOTHER PART THAT COMES OUT MORE LATERALLY ON THE SIDE OF THE BRAIN THAT CORRESPONDS TO YOUR LIPS YOUR JAW YOUR LARINCS AND WE HAVE SEEN THAT WHEN PATIENTS HAVE SURGERIES ARE INJURIES TO THAT PART OF THE BRAIN IT ACTUALLY CAN REALLY INTERRUPT LANGUAGE SO IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS JUST MOVING THE MUSCLES OF THE VOCAL TRAK BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT FOR FORMULATING AN EXPRESSING WORDS SO THAT'S BROKE US AREA THAT I THINK THE FIELD NOW RECOGNIZES NOT JUST BECAUSE OF OUR WORK BUT MANY OTHER PEOPLE THAT HAVE STUDYED THIS IN STROKE IN BEYOND IS THAT THE IDEA THAT THAT IS THA THE BASIS OF SPEAKING IN BROKES AREA IS FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG RIGHT NOW AND WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CORRECT THE TEXT BOOKS THAT WE CANNOT UNDERSTAND THAT SO THOUGH WE CAN CONTINUE TO TO MAKE PROGRESS NOW IN TERMS OF THE OTHER MAJOR AREA THAT WE CALL WERNIKEES ERE IN THE POSTURE TEMPOROLOPE UM THAT HAS HELD HELT A I THINK QUITE LEGITIMATELY FOR SOME TIME SO THAT IS AN AREA THAT YOU HAVE TO BE SUPERCAREFUL WHEN YOU DO SURGERY THERE THAT'S AN AREA WERE IF YOU HAVE A MISTAKE THERE AND YOU CAUSE A STROKE OR YOU EMOVE TOO MUCH OF THE TUMOR THERE YOU GO TOO FAR BEYOND IT THEN THE PERSON CAN BE REALLY REALLY HURT LIKE THE'LL HAVE A CONDITION THAT WE CALL A FASIA WHERE THEY MAY NOW BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WORDS THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TOO A REMEMBER THE WORD THAT THERE THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO SAY THEY THEY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO SAY BUT THEY CAN'T REMEMBER THE PRECISE WORD THAT GOES WITH OBJECT THAT THEY'R TRYING THINK OF THEY MAY EVEN PRODUCE WORDS THAT I DESCRIBE AFOREI LIKE WORDS SALAD OR VERY JARGONY SO IN'S YOU KNOW THEY MIGHT SAY SOMETHING LIKE TOMER AND I THAT'S NOT A REAL WORD BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE IT COULD BE YOU KNOW AND THAT'S JUST BECAUSE THAT PART OF THE BRAIN HAS SOME ROLE NOT JUST AN UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE HERE BUT ALSO OCTUALLY HAS A REALLY IMBORN RULE AND SENDING THE COMMANDS TO DIFFERENT PERSON BRING TO  CONTROL WHAT WE SAY NOT LONG AGO YOU AND ME AND MY GOOD FRIEND RICK REUBEN WERE HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT MEDICINE IN SCIENCE AND RICK ASKED THE QUESTION WHAT PERCENTAGE OF WHAT YOU LEARNED IN GRADUATE AND OUR MEDICAL SCHOOL DO YOU THINK IS CORRECT AND YOU HAD A VERY INTERESTING ANSWER WOULD YOU SHARE IT WITH US A I DON'T KNOW I DON'T REMEMBER THE EXACT BUT I I WOULD SAY THAT AM WITH REGARD TO THE BRAIN IN PARTICULAR I WOULD SAY ABOUT FIFTY PER CENT GETS IT RIGHT IN ACCURATE AND IS HELTFUL BUT ANOTHER FIFTY PER CENT IS JUST THE APPROXIMATION AND OVER SIMPLIFICATION OF WHAT'S GOING ON THE EXAMPLE THAT WE TALK ABOUT LANGUAGE JUST IN EXAMPLE OF THAT IT'S JUST A THERE ARE THINGS THAT MAKE IT EASIER TO LEARN AND EASIER TO TEACH AN EASIER TO EVEN THINK ABOUT THAT'S PROBABLY WHY WE CONTINUE TEACH YOU IN THE WAY THAT WE DO BUT I THINK IT'S TIME GOES ON THE COMPLEXITY OF OF REALITY OF HOW THE BRAIN WORKS IS AM WHILE FIRST FAULT WE'RE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT AND SECOND OF ALL IT IS COMPLEXING IT IS IT'S STILL IN COMPLETE STORY EARLY DAYS MO WELL GET INTO SOME OF THE TECHNICAL ADVANCES THAT ARE ALLOWING SOME CORRECTION OF THE ERRORS THAT THE FIELD HAS MADE AND LOOK NO DISRESPECT TO THE BRAIN EXPLORERS THAT CAME BEFORE US AND ON THE ONES THAT COME AFTER US WILL CORRECT US RIGHT THAT'S THE WAY THE GAME AS PLAYED BUT AM WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN TRUTHS THAT PEOPLE ACCEPT AND THAN THERE'S A ABOUT HALF OF THE INFORMATION THAT IS STILL OPEN FOR DEBATE AND MAY BE EVEN FOR COMPLETE REVISION ONE THING THAT I LEARNED ABOUT LANGUAGE AND THE NORL CIRCUITS UNDERLYING LANGUAGES THAT IT'S HEAVILY LATTERALIZED THAT THESE STRUCTURES BROKE AS IN VERNEKIES AND OTHER STRUCTURES IN THE BRAIN RESPONSIBLE FOR SPEECH AND COMPREHENSION OF SPEECH SIT MAINLY ON ONE SIDE OF THE BRAIN BUT THEY DO NOT HAVE A MIRROR REPRESENTATION OR ANOTHER ER EQUIVALENTARY ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE O THE BRAIN N FOR THOSE THAT HAVEN'T AM POKED AROUND IN A LOT OF BRAINS AM CERTAINL YOU AT YOU HAVE DONE FAR MORE OF THAT THAN I HAVE WHET I'VE DONE MY FAIR SHARE IN NONE HUMAN SPECIES IN LIDABIT IN HUMANS ALMOST EVERY STRUCTURE ALMOST EVERY STRUCTURE HAS A MATCHING STRUCTURE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BRAIN SO WHEN WE SAY THE HIPPOCAMP AS WE REALLY MEAN TOO HIPPOCAMP I ONE ON EACH SIDE OF THE BRAIN BUT LANGUAGE I WAS TAUGHT IS HEAVILY LATTERALZED THAT IS THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE SO THAT RAISES TWO QUESTIONS ONE IS THAT TRUE AND IF IT IS TRUE THEN WHAT IS THE EQUIVALENT REAL ESTATE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE BRAIN DOING YE IF IT'S NOT DOING THE SAME FUNCTION THAT THE ONE ON THE SAY THE LEFT SIDE IS PERFORMING WELL THAT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT IS AGAIN LIKE MOSTLY TRUE NOT A HUNDRED PER CENT AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THAT A IT'S COMPLICATED SO FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE RIGHT HANDED NINETY NINE PER CENT OF THE TIME THE LANGUAGE PART OF THE BRAIN IS ON ON THE LEFT SIDE AND WHAT IS THE EQUIVALENT BRAIN AREA ON THE RIGHT SIDE DOING IF IT'S NOT DOING LANGUAGE WELL YOU KNOW TO THINK THAT'S INCREDIBLE AS IF YOU LOOK AT THE RIGHT SIDE AND YOU LOOK AT IT VERY CAREFULLY EITHER UNNEAR AN EMORI OR YER SHOULD LOOK AT THE BRAIN UNDER SLIDES AT A MICROSCOPE IT LOOKS VERY VERY SIMILAR IT'S NOT IDENTICAL BUT IT LOOKS VERY VERY SIMILAR ALL THE GIRI WHICH ARE THE THE BOMPS ON THE BRAIN THAT YOU KNOW HAVE THE DIFFERENT CONTOURS AND THE VALLEYS I WE CALL SOL SIDE THOSE ALL LOOK BASICALLY THE SAME LIKE THERE IS A MURE AN ATOMY ON THE LEFT AIN RIGHT SIDE AND SO IT'S NOT BEEN SO CLEAR WHAT SO SPECIAL ACTUALLY ABOUT THE LEFT SIDE TO A TO HOUSE LANGUAGE BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW THIS IS WHAT WE USE ALL THE TIME IN ASSESSING FIGURING A YOU KNOW THIS BEFORE SURDERY IS IF YOU'RE RIGHT HANDED NINETY NINE PERCENT THE TIME THE LANGUAGE IS GOING TO BE ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE BRAIN IS HANDEDNISS GENETIC IN ANY WAY A IN WHEN I AS TREW UP I A PEN OR PENCIL WAS GRAN WAS PLACED INTO MY HAND PRESUME LEAR I STARTED YOU SEE MY MY FATHER WAS LEFT HANDED AND THEN WHERE HE GREW UP IN SOUTH AMERICA THEY THEY FORCED HIM TO TO FORCE HIMSELF TO BECOME RIGHT HANDD IF SHE USED TO RESTRICT THE MOVEMENT OF HIS LEFT HAND SO HE WAS FORCED TO WRITE SO A AND THEN YOU HAVE HOOK HOOK LEFTY E HOOK RITY E A I KNOW THIS IS A DEEP DIVE AND WE PRALY TO ANT TO GO IN EVERY DERROVATION OF THIS BUT SO FOR SOMEBODY WHOSE LEFT HANDED NATURALLY JUSTARTS RITING WIT THE LEFT HAND THERE'S  SOME GYNETIC PREDISPOSITION TO BEING LEFT HANDED ABSOLUTELY NO QUESTION ABOUT IT HANDINESS IS IS NOT ENTIRELY BUT STRONGLY GENETIC SO A THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THE TIES ALL OF THIS AND WHAT IS HANDIDNESS FORK SIMPLE HAVE TO DO WITH WERE THE PART OF YOUR BRIN THAT CONTROLS LANGUAGE WELL TURNS OUT THAT THE PARTS THAT CONTROL THE HAND ARE VERY CLOSE THERE IS THAT REALLY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE VOCAL TRACT AAGAIN PART OF THE MOTOR QUARTEX IM PART OF THIS BRAIN AREA CALLED THE PRE CENTRAL CIRIS AND THERE ARE SOME THEORIES THAT BECAUSE OF THEIR PROXIMITY A THAT THESE PARTS OF HE BRAIN MIGHT DEVELOP TOGETHER EARLY IN EUTORO AND THEY MIGHT HAVE A HEAD START COMPARES THE RIGHT SIDE AND BECAUSE THEY HAVE A HEAD START THAT THINGS SOLIDIFY THERE THIS IS ONE THEORY OF WHY THIS HAPPENS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE LEFT HANDED IT STILL TURNS OUT THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE HAVE LANGUAGE ON THE LEFT SIDE BUT IT'S NOT NINETY NINE PERSON IT'S MORE LIKE SEVITY PERSON SIFFOU'RE LEFT HANDED I' STILL MORE LIKELY THAT THE LANGUAGE PART OF YOUR BRAIN IS GOING TO BE ON THE LEFT SIDE BUT THERE IS GOING TO BE A GREATER PROPORTION MAY BE TWENTY THIRTY PER SENT WHERE IT'S EITHER IN BOTH HEMISPHERES OR ON THE RIGHT SIDE AND JUST TO MAKE THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE INTERESTING IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE HAVE STROKES ON THE LEFT SIDE AND IF THEY ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO RECOVER FROM THOSE STROKES SOMETIMES THAT INVOLVES REORGANIZATION THIS TERM THAT WE CALL PLASTICITY EARLIER WHERE THE AIRIES AROUND WERE THE STROKE TAKE ON THAT NEW FUNCTION A WAY THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE THAT CAN CERTAINLY HAPPEN IN THE LEFT HEMISPHERE BUT THERE ARE ALSO INSTANCES WHERE THE RIGHT HEMISPHERE CAN ALSO START TO TAKE ON THE FUNCTION OF LANGUAGE WHERE IT WEN IT WAS ONCE THE LEFT AND THEN TRANSFERS TO THE RIGHT SO THE THING THAT I I THINK ABOUT A LOT IS TEAD THAT THE MACHINERY PROBABLY EXISTS ON BOTH SIDES BUT WE DON'T USE THEM TOGETHER ALL THE TIME IN FACT WE MAY STRONGLY BY US ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER JUST LIKE WE USE OUR TWO HANDS IN VERY VERY DIFFERENT WAYS IT'S A LITTLE BIT THE SAME WITH THE BRAIN WELL IT'S BECAUSE OF WHAT WE DO WITH THE BRIN THAT ACTUALLY IS WHY WE USE THE HANDS IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND THE SAME THING GOES FOR LANGUAGE WHICH IS  AGAIN THE SUBSTRATES THE ORGAN THE LANGUAGE ORGAN THE PART OF THE BRAIN THE PROCESS IT PROBABLY HAS VERY SIMILAR MACHINERY ON THE LEFT SIDE IS THE RIGHT NTHE RIGHT MAY HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO DO IT BUT IN REAL EVERY DAY USE THE BRAIN SPECIALIZES ONE OF THE SIDES IN ORDER FOR US TO TO USE IT FUNCTIONALLY THAT'S THAT'S A THEORY YOU'RE BY LANGUELL CORRECT YE YOU SPEAK ENGLISH ANCHINESE YE FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE BY LANGUEL AND THAT LEARN TWO OR MORE LANG O BY LANGUAS TO OBVIOUSLY BUT LEARN BOTH LANGUAGES ER THAT'S AY MORE LANGUAGES FROM AN EARLY TIME AN LIFE DO THEY USE THE SAME BRAIN AREA TO GENERATE THAT LANGUAGE OR PERHAPS THEY USE THE LEFT SIDE TO SPEAK ENGLISH IN THE RIGHT SIDE TO SPEAK GINESE DO WE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT BY LANGUILISM IN THE BRAIN I THINK WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT BY LANGUALISM THE BRAIN THE ANSWERS  ARE STILL OUT THERE THE FINAL ANSWERS ON IT AND PART OF THE ANSWER IS YES ABSOLUTELY WE USE SOME PARTS OF THE BRAIN AH VERY SIMILARLY WE ACT TO HAVE A STUDYING THE LABORIT NOW WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS WHERE PEOPL GH WHO SPEAK ONE LANGUAGE OR ANOTHER OR BY LANGUELL I ANMD WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW THE BRAIN ACTIVITY PATTERNS OCCUR WHETHER HERE IN ONE LANGUAGE VIRSES THE OTHER AND WHAT STRIKING TO SEE ACTUALLY IS HOW OVERLOPING THEY REALLY CAN BE EVEN THOUGH THE PERSON MAYN HAVE NO IDEA OF THE LANGUAGE THAT THEIARE HEARING  THE ENGLISH PART OF THE BRAIN STILL PROCESSING THAT AND MAY BE TRYING TO INTERPRET IT THROUGH AN ENGLISH LANDS FOR EXAMPLE SO THE SHORT ANSWER IS THAT WITH BY LINGUIISM THERE ARE SHEERED CIRCUISTRY THERER THERE'S TO SHARED MACHINERY N THE BRAIN THAT ALLOWS US TO PROCESS BOTH  BUT IT'S NOT IDENTICAL  IT'S THE IT'S THE SAME PART OF THE BRAIN BUT WHAT IT'S DOING WITH THE SIGNALS CAN BE VERY VERY DIFFERENT AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT PRECISELY IS NOT THE INSTANTANEOUS DETECTING OF ONE SOUND TO THE NEXT BUT THE MEMORY OF THE SEQUENCES OF THOSE PARTICULAR SOUNDS THAT GIVE RISE O THINGS LIKE WORDS AND MEANING THAT CAN BE HIGHLY VARIABLE FROM ONE INDIVIDUAL TO THE NEXT AND THOSE NORADS ARE VERY VERY SENSITIVE TO THE SEQUENCEESS OF THE SOUNDS EVEN THOUGH THE SOUNDS THEMSELVES MIGHT HAVE SOME OVERLOP BETWEEN LANGUAGES FASCINATING TETS SO WE TALKE ABOUT BRAIN AREAS AND A LITTL BIT ABOUT LATERALIZATION IWANT TO GET BACK TO THE HANDS AND SOMETHINGS REIN TO EMOTION AN LON BIT BUT MAYBE NOW WE COAN GO INTO THOSE BRAIN AREAS AND START TYO ASK THE QUESTION WHAT EXACTLY IS REPRESENTED OR MAPPED THERE AND FOR PEOPLE WHO PERHAPS AREN'T FAMILIAR WITH BRAIN MAPPING AND REPRESENTATION AND RECEPTIVE FEELDS PERHAPS THE SIMPLEST ANALOGY MIGHT BE THE VISUAL SYSTEM WHERE I LOOK AT YOUR FACE I KNOW YOU I RECOGNIZE YOU AND CERTAINLY THERE ARE BRAIN AREAS THETER RESPONSIBLE FOR FACE RECOGNITION BUT THE FACT THAT I KNOW THAT'S YOUR FACE AND FOR THOSE LISTENING AND LOOKING INTO EDY'S FACE THE FACT I KNOW THAT THAT'S YOUR FACE AT ALL IS BECAUSE WE ARE WELL AWARE THAT THERE ARE CELLS THAT REPRESENT EDGES AND THAT REPRESENTD DARK AND LIGHT AND THOSE ALL COMBINE IN WHAT WE CALL A HIERORSTRUCTURE THEY SOR BUILD UP FROM BASIC ELEMENTS AS SIMPLE AS LITTLE DOTS BUT THE LINES AND THINGS THAT MOVE AT CETERA TO GIVE A COHERENT REPRESENTATION OF THE FACE WHEN I THINK ABOUT LANGUAGE I THINK ABOUT WORDS AND JUST TALKING IF I SIT DOWN TO DO A LONG PODCAST AR I THINK ABOUT ASKING A QUESTION I DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT THE WORDS I WANT TO SAY VERY MUCH I MEN T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THEM ALOW IT ONE WOULD HOPE BUT I DON'T THINK ABOUT INDIVIDUAL SYLLABLES UNLESS I'M TRYING TO YOU KNOW ACCENT SOMETHING WHERE 'S A WORD THAT I HAVE A PARTICULAR DIFFICULTY SAYING WHERE I WANT A CHANGE THE CASES ET CETERA SO WHAT'S REPRESENTED IN TH IN THE NURONS THE NERVE CELLS IN THESE AREAS ARE THEY REPRESENTING VOWELS CONSODANCE AND HOW DO THINGS LIKE INFLECTION LIKE I OCCASIONALLYWILL POKE FON IT UP SPEAK BUT THERE'S A I THINK A HEALTHY E ADNORMAL  AVERSION OF OBSTEAK OR SOMEBODY'S ASKING A QUESTION LIKE FOR INSTANCE WHAT IS THAT THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE USE OF UP SPEAK I SUPPOSED TO SAYING SOMETHING THAT IS NOT A QUESTION AND PUTTING A LILT AT THE END OF THE SENDENCE THEN WE CALL THAT UPSPEAK WHICH IT DOESN'T FIT WITH WHAT THE PERSON IS SAYING SO WHAT IN THE WORLD IS CONTAINED IN THESE BRAIN AIREAS WHAT IS REPRESENTED A TO ME IS IS PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING QUESTIONS AND I KNOW THIS LAND SQUARE IN YOUR WHEEL HOUSE SURE LET'S GET INTO THIS A ANDREW BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING STUFF THAT'S HAPPENING OR I NOW IS UNDERSTANDING HOW THE BRAIN PROCESSES THESE EXACT QUESTIONS AND YOU ASK ME RLYOR YOU KNOW WHAT IS DIFFETWEEN SPEECH AND LANGUAGE A SPEECH CORRESPONDS TO AM THE COMMUNICATION SIGNAL IT CORRESPONDS TO ME MOVING MY MOUTH IN MY VOCAL TRACT TO GENERATE WORDS AND YOURE HEARING THESE IS AN AUDITORY SIGNAL LANGUAGE IS A SOMETHING MUCH BROADER SO IT REFERS TO  WHAT YOU'RE EXTRACTING FROM THE WORDS AND I'M SAYING WE CALL THAT PRAGMATICS AND SIRARE YOU GETTING THE GIST OF WHAT I'M SAYING THERE'S ANOTHER ASPECT OF IT THAT WE CALL SOMANTICS DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF THESE WORDS AND ON THE SENTENCES THERE'S ANOTHER PART THAT WE CALL SINTAX WHICH REFERS TO HOW THE WORDS ARE ASSEMBLED IN A GRAMATICAL FORM SO THOSE ARE ALL REALLY CRITICAL PARTS OF LANGUAGE AND SPEECH IS JUST ONE FORM OF LANGUAGE ERES MANY OTHER FORMS LIKE SIGN LANGUAGE AH READING THOSE ARE ALL IMPORTANT MODALITIES FOR READING OUR RESEARCH REALLY FOCSES ON ON THIS THIS AR THE RECALLING SPEECH AGAIND THE PRODUCTION OF THIS AUDIO SIGNAL WHICH YOU CAN'T SEE BUT YOUR MICROPHONES ARE PICKING UP THERE ARE THESE VIBRATIONS IN THE AIR THAT ARE CREATED BY MY VOCAL TRACT THAT ARE PICKED UP BY THE MICROPHONE AH IN THE PIN THE CASE OF THIS RECORDING BUT ALSO PICKED UP BY THE SENSORS IN YOUR EAR THE VERY TINY VIBRATIONS YOUR A EAR ARE PICKING THAT UP IN TRANSLATING THAT INTO ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY AND WHAT THE EAR DOES AT THE PERIFERY IS TRANSLATES ALL SOUNDS INTO DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES SO IT'S MAN THING TO DO IS TO TAKE AH A SPEECH SIGNAL OR ANY OTHER KIND OF SOUND AND DECOMPOSIT MEANING SEPARATE THAT SOUND INTO DIFFERENT KIND OF SIGNALS AND IN THE CASE OF HEARING WHAT IT'S DOING IS SEPARANG IT OUT INTO LOW MIDDLE HIGH FREQUENCIES IT A VERY VERY HIGH RESOLUTION S DOING IT VERY QUICKLY IN ITS DOING IN A REALLY FINE WAY TO SEPARATE ALL F THOSE DIFFERENT SOUNDS SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE PERIFERY NEAR THE NERVE THAT GOES TO YOUR EAR THOSE NERVE FIBRS SOME OF THEM ARE TUNED TO LOW FREQUENCY SOME OF EM ARE TUNE TO HIGH FREQUENCIS SOME OF THEM OR TUINTO T MENTAL FREQUENCIES AND THAT IS WHAT YOUR EAR IS DOING ITS TAKING THESE WORDS AND SPLITTING THEM UP INTO DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES AND FOR THOSE WHE GOT THERE THAT AREN'T FAMILIAR WITH THINKING BOUT THINGS IN THE SO CALL FREQUENCY SPACE OM BASE TONES WOULD BE LOWER FREQUENCIES AND HIGH PITCHEDTONES WOULD BE HIGHER FREQUENCIES JUST TO MAKE SURE VUONCES ON THE SAME PAGE SO THE SOUND OF MY VOICE THE SOUND OF YOUR VOICE OR ANY SOUND IN THE AIREMENT IS BEING BROKEN DOWN INTO THESE FREQUENCIES ARE THEY BEING BROKEN DOWN INTO VERY NARROW CHANNELS OF FREQUENCY OR THEY AM ONE AVOIDING KNOMING CLATURE HERE OM OR THEY ARE THEY BEING BEND AS FAIRLY BROAD FREQUENCIES CAUSE WE KNOW LOW MEDIUM AT HIGH BUT TEM FOR INSTANCE I CAN DETECT WHETHER NOT SOMETHINGS APPROACHING ME OR OR MOVING AWAY FROM ME DEPENDING ON WHETHER NOT IT SWEEPS LOUDER O OR  IT HORDS ARE AWAY IT'S SUBTLE BUT AND OF COURSE ITS COMBINE WITH WHAT I SEE AND MY OWN MOVEMENT BUT OM HOW FINALY SLICED IS OUR PERCEPTION OF THE AUDITORY WORLD OH EXTRAORDINARILY PRECISE I MEAN WE TAKE THESE MILL O SECOND CUES THE MILL O SECOND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SOUND COMING TO ONE EAR LET SEE YOUR RITEAR VERSES YOUR LEFT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT DIRECTION THAT SOUND CAME FROM THOSE ARE ONLY MILL SECOND DIFFERENCIS AND THAT'S HOW PRECISE THIS WORKS BUT ON THE OTHER HAND O IT DOES A LOT OF COMPUTATION ON THIS IT DOES A LOT OF ANALYSIS AS YOU GO UP AND A LOT OF OUR WORK IS FOCAS ON THE THE PART OF THE BRAIN THAT WE CALL THE QUARTEX THE QUARTEXIS THE THE OUTERMOST PARBRAIN WHERE WE BELIEVE THAT SOUNDS ARE ACTUALY CONVERTED INTO WORDS AND LANGUAGE SO THERE'S IS TRANSFORMATION WHERE AT THE EAR WORDS ARE DECOMPOSE AND YOU KNOW TURNED INTO THESE ELEMENTAL FREQUENCY CHANNELS AND THEN AS IT GOES UP THROUGH THE AUDITORY SYSTEM IT'S THE QUARTEX THERE ARE SOME THINGS TO HAPPEN OBVISY BEFORE GETS THE QUARTEX BUT WHEN IT GETS TO QUARTEX THOUGH SOMETHING SPECIAL GOING ON WHICH IS THAT THAT PART OF THE BRAIN IS LOOKING FOR SPECIFIC SOUNDS AND SPECIFICALLY WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THE SOUNDS OF YOU MAN LANGUAGE SO THE ONES THAT ARE THE DIFFERENT CONSONENCE AND VOWELS IN A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE HAVE STUDIED THIS IS LOOKING IN PATIENCE WHO HAVE APELEPSY AND AND WHY TO THESE CASES WHERE THE AMORI LOOKS COMPLETELY NORMAL WE HAVE TO PUT ELECTROTES SURGICALLY ON A PART OF THE BRAIN I THE TEMPORALOPE IS A VERY VERY COMMONPLACE SO WE'VE DONE A LOT OF OUR WORK LOOKING AT OU THE TEMPORALOPE PROCESSES SPEAK SOUNDS BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING FOR OT WERE THE SEIZURE START BUT THEN RE ALSO DOING BRAIN MAPPING FOR LANGUAGE AND SPEECH SO WE CAN PROTECT THOSE EARS WE WANT IDENTIFY THE AIRS THAT WE WANT A REMOVE TO CURE SOME ONE SEIZURES BUT WE ALSO WANT TO FIGURE OUT THE ARREAS AT AR IMPORTANT FOR SPEECH AND LANGUAGE TO PROTECT THOSE SO THAT WE CAN DO AS ASSURTED THAT'S EFFECTIVE AND SAFE AND SO IN OUR RESEARCH ND WHY IT'S BECOME A REALLY IMPORTANT ADDITION TO OUR KNOWLEDGE IS THAT WE HAVE ELECT ROTES DIRECTLY RECORDING FROM THE HUMAN BRAIN SURFACE A LOGS ACNOWLODGY WE WORK WITH RYNOW IS RECORDING ON THE MILL ON THE ORDER OF MILLIMETERS AN THEY CAN ORDER THEY CAN RECORD MILLA SECOND TIME RESOLUTION OF NORAL ACTIVITY ND WHAT WE SEE IS EXTRAORDINARY PATTERNS OF ACTIVITY WHEN PEOPLE HEAR WORDS AND SENTENCES IF YOU LOOK AT THAT PART OF THE BRAIN THAT WE CALL WERNIKES ERE IN THIS PART OF THE TEMPORAL LOB THIS WHOLE AREA LIGHTS UP WHEN YOU HEAR WORDS OR SPEECH AND IT IS NOT IN A WAY THAT IS LIKE A GENERAL LIBL WARMING UP AND IT'S GENERALLY LIND UP BUT WHAT YOU ACTUALLY SEE IS SOMETHING MUCH MUCH MORE COMPLICATED WHICH IS A PATTERN OF ACTIVITY AND WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE LAST TEN YEARS IS TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS THAT PATTERN COME FROM AND IF WE WERE TO LOOK AT EACH INDIVIDUAL SIGHT FROM THAT PART OF THE BRAIN WHAT WOULD WE SEE WHAT PARTS OF WORDS ARE BEING COTED BY ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY IN THOSE PARTS OF MEY REMEMBER THE CARTEX IS USING ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY TO TRANSMITE INFORMATION AND DO ANALYSIS AND WHAT WERE DOINGS WERE EVES DROPPING ON THIS PART OF THE BRAIN AS ITS PROCESSING SPEECH TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT EACH INDIVIDUAL SIGHT IS DOING AND WHAT ARE THE SIGHTS DOING OR COULD YOU GIVE US SOME EXAMPLES WHAT THOSE SIDES ARE DOING SO FOR INSTANCE ARE THEY SIGHTS THAT ARE SPECIFIC FOR WHAT WE COULD SAY EVEN LISTENING FOR CONSONANCE OR VOWELS OR FOR A INFLECTION OR FOR EMOTIONALITY WHAT'S IN THERE OK WELL WAT WHAT MAKES THESE WHAT AT MAKES THESE CELLS FIRE YAH WHAT GETS THEM EXCITED WHAT GETS THEM GOING IS HERING SPEECH IN PARTICULAR THERE ARE SOME OF THESE REALLY FOCALSITES AGAIN JUST ON THE ORDER OF MILLMETER OR AT SOME LEVEL SINGLE NARANS THAT AURE TUNE TO CONSONANCE SOME ARE TUNE TO VOWS SOME ARE TUNE TO PARTICULAR FEATURES OF CONSONANCE WHAT I MEAN BY THAT ARE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF A CONSONANCE THERE'S A CLASS OF CONSONANCE THAT WE CALL CLOSE IF CONSONANCE THIS A LOTO BIT OF LINQUAS SICHARGON BUT I MIN TO MAKE A POINT HERE WITH THAT IS THAT CERTAIN CLASSES OF SOUNDS WHEN YOU MAKE THEM IT REQUIRES YOU TO ACTUALLY CLOSE YOUR MOUTH TEMPORARILY NOW MAN BE THINKING ABOUT THIS SUPPLOSIVE LIKE PLOSIVE LIKE SAYING THE WORD PLOSIVE DOES REQUIRES THAT EXACTLY SO WHAT S COOL ABOUT THAT IS THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE NO IDEA WAS CUINON IN OUR MOUTH WHEN WE SPEAK WE REALLY HAVE NO IDEA SOME PEOPLE DEFINILLY HAVE NO IDEA WELL NOT JUST LIKE IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING SOME TIMES O BUT ACTUALLY LIKE HOW YOU ARE ACTUALLY MOVING RIT YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF VOCOTRACT AND I'VE A FEELING IF WE ACTUALY REQUIRED UNDERSTANDING WE WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO SPEAK AS IT SO COMPLEX IT'S SUCH A COMPLEX FEET SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY IT'S THE MOST COMPLEX MOTOR THING THAT WE DO AS A SPECIES IS IS O SPEAKING NOT YOU KNOW THE EXTREME FEATS OF ACROBATICS OR ATHLOTICISM BUT OONE AS O SPEAKING YOU AN ESPECIALLY WHEN A ONE OBSERVES YE OPERA OR ON PEOPLE WHO INA FREESTILE WRAPPERS IN  AND OF COURSE IS NOT JUST THE LIPS IT'S THE TONGUE AND AND YOU'VE MENTIONED TO AM OTHER STRUCTURES FARINS AND LARINGS ARE THE MAIN ON ES THAT THE  HE TELLUS JUST JUST EDUCATES AT AS AS SUPERFICIAL LEVEL WHAT THES BEARINS AND LARINGS DO DIFFERENTIALLY CAUS I THINK MUST BE WOREN'T GOING TO BE E SUR SO A I'LL TALK PRIMARILY ABOUT THE LARINXS HERE FOR A SECOND WHICHIS THAT IF YOU THINK ABOUT ONE WE'RE SPEAKING A REALLY WHAT WE'RE DOINGS FOR SHAPING THE BREATH SO EVEN BEFORE YOU GET TO LARINCS YOU GOT A START WITH THE EXPIRATION SO WE FILL UP OUR LUNGS AND THEN WE PUSH THE AIR OUT THAT'S A NORMAL PART BREATHING AND WHAT IS REALLY AMAZING ABOUT SPEECH AN LANGUAGEIS THAT WE EVOLVED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT NORMAL PHYSIOLOGIC THING AT A LARINS AND WHAT THE LARN DOES IS THAT WHEN YOU'RE EXHALING IT BRINGS THE VOCAL FOLDS TOGETHER SOME PEOPLE CALL THEM VOCAL CHORDS THEY'RE NOT REALLY CORDS THE REALLY VOCAL FOLDS THEYRE TWO PIECE OF TEACH YOU THAT COME TOGETHER AN A MUSCLE BRINGS THEM TOGETHER ND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN THE AIR COMES THROUGH THE VOCAL FOLDS WHEN THEY'RE TOGETHER THEY VIBRATE AH IT REALLY HIGH FREQUENCIES LIKE A HUNDRED OR TWO HUNDRED HURTS YOURS IS PROBABLY ABOUT A HUNDRED HURTS AS YOURS IS TWO HUNDRED AOURS S MOST MALE VOICES ROUND A HUNDRED LOOK AND THEN THE AVERAGE FEMALE VOICE AROUND TWO HUNDRED S ND AS YOU KNOW I'VE ALWAYS HAD THE SAME VOICE YES IS S WAS US LANT OR SHAME WHEN I WAS  FOLKS MY VOICE NEVER CHANGED I ALWAYS HAD THE SAME VOICE IS IS A DISCUSSION FOR ANOTHER WELL IT'S A GRAVE VOICE A YOU KNOW A GREAT BARRTON VOICE BUT I KNOW WIN YOUR VOICE IT'S A LOW FREQUENCY VOICE AND THE REASON WHY MEN AND WOMEN GENERALLY HAVE DIFFERENT A VOICE QUALITIES IS IT HAS TO DO WITH THE SIGHS OF THE LARINCS IN THE SHAPE OF IT O CASE SO IN GENERAL MEN HAVE A LARGER VOICE BOX OR LARINCS AND THE VIBRATING FREQUENCY THE RESIDENCE FREQUENCY OF THE VOCAL FOLDS WHEN THE AIR COMES THROUGH THEM IS ABOUT A HUNDRED HURTS FOR MEN AND ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FOR WOMEN SO WHAT HAPPENS IS OKE SO YOU'RE TAKING YOU TAKE A BRIATH BREATH HEN AND THEN AS THE ERROR IS COMING OUT THE VOCAL FOL 'S COME TOGETHER THE AIR GOES THROUGH THAT CREATES THE SOUND OF THE VOICE THAT WE CALL VOICING AND THAT'S THE ENERGY OF YOUR VOICE IT'S NOT JUST YOUR VOICE CHARACTERISTIC IT'S THE ENERGY OF YOUR VOICE IT'S COMING FROM THE LARINXS THERE IT'S A NOISE AND THEN IT'S THE SOURCE OF THE VOICE AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT ENERGY THAT SOUND GOES UP THROUGH THE PARTS OF THE VOCAL TRACK LIKE THE FARINXS INTO THE ORAL CAVITY WHICH IS YOUR MOUTH IN YOUR TONGUE IN YOUR LIPS AND WHAT THOSE THINGS ARE DOING IS THAT THEIR SHAPING THIS THE AIR IN PARTICULAR WAYS THAT CREATE CONSUMNANCE AND VOWS SO THAT'S WHAT I MEAN BY SHAPING THE BREATH IT JUST STARTS WITH THIS EXCELLATION YOU GENERATE THE VOICE IN THE LARINKS AND THEN EVERYTHING ABOVE THE LARINXS ITS MOVING AROUND JUST LIKE THE WAY MY MOUTH IS DURING RIGHT NOW TO SHAPE THAT AIR INTO PARTICULAR PATTERNS THAT YOU CAN HEAR ITS WORDS FASCINATING AND OIMMEDIATELY MAKES ME WONDER ABOUT YOU MORE IM PRIMITIVE WERE NON LEARNED VOCALIZATIONS LIKE CRYING OR LAUGHTER BABIES WILL CRY BABIES WILL SHO LAUGHTER ARE THOSE SORTS OF A VOCALIZATIONS PRODUCED BY THE LANGUAGAREAS LIKE VERNICKIES OR DO THEY HAVE THEIR OWN UNIQUE NERAL STRUCTURES YAH INTERESTING QUESTION SO WE WE CALL THOSE VOCALIZATIONS AM A VOCALIZATION IS BASICALLY WHERE SOME ONE CAN CREATE A SOUND LIKE A CRY OR A MOAN AM THAT KIND OF SOUND AND IT ALSO INVOLVES THE EXELLATION OF AIR IT ALSO INVOLVES SOME VONATION AT THE LEVEL LARINGS WHERE THE VOCAVOLTS COME TOGETHER TO CREATE THAT AUDIBLE SOUND BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT THOSE ARE ACTUALLY DIFFERENT AREAS SO PEOPLE WHO HAVE INJURIES IN THE SPEECH AND LANGUAGE EARS OFTENTIMES CAN STILL MOANED THEY CAN STILL VOCALIZE AND IT IS A DIFFERENT PART OF THE BRAIN I WOULD SAY AN AREA THAT I EVEN NON HUMAN PRIMATES HAVE THAT CAN BE SPECIALIZED YOU KNOW FOR VOCALIZATION IS A DIFFERENT FORM OF COMMUNICATION THAN THE WORDS FOR EXAMPLE THE INTRICACY OF THESE CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN AND THEIR CONNECTIONS TO THE FARINKS AND LARINXS AN IS JUST IT'S ALMOST OVERWHELMING IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT JUST HOW COMPLICATED IT MUST BE AND YET SOME GENERAL FEATURES AND PRINCIPLES ARE STARTING TO EMERGE FROM YOUR WORK AND FROM THE WORK OF OTHERS IF WE THINK ABOUT THAT WORK AND WE THINK ABOUT RINSINCE VERNECKI'S AREA IF I WERE T RECORD FROM NURONS IN VERNECKIE'S AREA AAT DIFFERENT LOCATIONS WOULD I FIND THAT THERE'S ANY N SYSTEMATIC LAY OUT FOR INSTANCE IN TERMS TAT U TOCK ABOUT SOUND FREQUENCY WE KNOW THAT LOW FREQUENCIES ARE REPRESENTED AT ONE END OF A STRUCTURE AND HIGH FREQUENCIES AT THE OTHER THIS IS TRUE ACTUALLY RELEAST FROM MY EARLIER TRAINING IT WITHIN THAT WITHIN THE YEAR ITSELF WITHIN THE COCLI THE EARLY WORK OF ON BECASY AN FROM CADAVERSRIGHT THEY I SHOU FIGURE THIS OUT FROM DEAD PEOPLE WHICH IS INCREDIBLE AA FASTENING LITERATURE PEOPLE SHOULD LOOK UP AM AND IN THE VISUAL SYSTEM WE KNOW THAT FOR INSTANCE YOU KNOW VISUAL POSITION WHERE THINGS ARS MAP SYSTEMATICALLY NOR IN OTHER WORDS NURANS THAT SIT NEXT TO EACH OTHER IN THE BRAIN REPRESENT PORTIONS OF VISUAL SPACE THAT ARE NEXT TO EACH OTHER IN THE REAL WORLD WHAT IS THE ORGANIZATION OF LANGUAGE IN ARIS LIKE VERNICKIES UNBROKE US FOR INSTANCE AM I THINK OF THE VALLS A I OWE YOU A AS AND OF A COHERENT UNIT BUT DO I FIND THE ANURANS ARE NEXT TO THE EANER HUNS ER NEXT TO THE A WERVAR THE VA THE A I OWE YOU IS THAT VAL REPRESENTATION ALSO LEAD OUT IN ORDER OR IS IT CONSULTAN PEPPER IS AT RANDOM THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE LIKE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS WE'VE BEEN TRANING ANSWER FOR THE PAST DECADE SO ATHERE IS A PART OF THE BRAIN THAT WE CALL THE PRIMARY AUDITORY QUARTEX IN THE PRIMARY AUDITORY QUARTEX IS DEEP IN THE TEMPORAL LOBE AND IF YOU LOOKED AT THAT PART OF THE BRAIN THERE IS A MAP OF DIFFERENT SOUND FREQUENCIES SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE FRONT OF THAT PRIMAR AUDITRY QUARTEX YOU'LL FIND LOW FREQUENCY SOUNDS AND THEN IS YOU MARCH BACKWARDS IN THAT THAT QUARTEIT GOES FROM LOW TO MEDIUM TIE FREQUENCIES ITS ORGANIZIN THIS REALLY NIGHT NICE IN ORDERLY WAY AND IT TURNS OUT THATE DOES NOT JUST ONE THERE'S LIKE MIRRORS OF THAT AM TONE FREQUENCY MAP IN THE PRIMRY AUDITORY QUARTEX THE AR IS THAT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR SPEECH AH ARE ON THE SIDE OF THAT AND WE NOW THINK THAT SPEECH CAN GO STRAIGHT TO THE SPEECH QUARTEX WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THRUGE THE PRIMARY AUDITORY QUARTEX AND IT HAS ITS OWN PATHWAY TO GET TO THE PART OF THE BRAIN ON THE PROCESSES SPEECH AND WHEN WE'VE LOOKED AT THAT QUESTION ABOUT IS THERE A MAP THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES THERE IS A MAP AND IT IS AH BUT IT IS NOT STRUCTURE A UNIVERSALLY ACROSS ALL PEOPLE IN A WAY THAT WE CAN CLEARLY SEE RIGHT NOW IT IS LIKE A SALTAN PEPPEROR MAP OF THE DIFFERENT FEATURES IND SPEECH SO BEFORE WE TALKED ABOUT THESE SOUNDS THAT ARE CALLED PLOSIVES YOU MAKE A PLOSIVE WHEN THE MOUTH OR SOMETHING THAT WRLK HOWTY CLOSES TEMPORARILY AND WHEN IT OPENS THAT CREATES THAT FAST PLOSIVE SOUND SO WHEN YOU SAY AM DAD AM OR AM YOU KNOW THE BALL LIKE THE BEE IN BALL THAT KIND OF THING YOU WILL NOTICE THAT YOURE YOUR LIPS I SHOULD CLOSE AND THEN IT'S THE RELEASE OF THAT THAT CREATES THAT PARTICULAR SOUNDS  SO THOSE OF THE SOUNDS THAT WE CALL PLOS OF THOSE ARE LIKE BATAKA PATACA THOSE ARE A CERTAIN CLASS OF CONSONANTS AN WE CALL A PLOSE SOUNDS THERE IS ANOTHER CLASS OF SOUNDS THAT WE CALL FRICATIVES IN LINGUISTICS FRICATIVES ARE CREATED BY TURBULENCE AN THE THE AIR STREAM HAS IT COMES OUT THROUGH THE MOUTH AN THE IN THE WAY THAT WE MAKE THAT TURBULENCE IS GETTING THE MOUTH IN THE LIPS TO CLOSE ALMOST UNTIL THEY'RE COMPLETELY SHUT OR PUTTING THE TONGUE TO NEAR THE TEETH ALMOST GET IT COMPLETELY SHUT BUT JUST HAVE A NARROW APERTURE THAT CREATES A TURBULENTS IN THE AIR FLO THAT WE PERCEIVE AS HIGH FREQUENCY SOUNDS SO THOSE HAT SOUNDS LIKE SHA AN SA THOSE KIND OF THINGS THOSE ARE IF YOU LOOK THE FREQUENCES ARE HIGHER FREQUENCIES AND THOSE ARE CREATED BY SPECIFIC MOVEMENTS THAT YOU CONSTRICT THE AIR FLOW TO CREATE TURBULENCS AND WE HEAR IT AS SHA SA SA SO IF I SAY THAT EXACTLY AND AS SUPPOSE TO OPPLOSIVE WHERE I'D SAY EXPLOSIVE Y I'M NOW OF COURSE I'M EMPHASIZING HERWILL THIS EXPLAINS AND A SOMETHING IN SALVS A MYSTERY WHICH AS RECENTLY IVE BEEN FASSNING BY THE WORK OF IT OF IT PHYSICIAN SCIENTISTS AM THACKEA DOCTOR CHAIN A SAN WHAS DONE A LOT OF WORK ON AM THINGS THAT ARE CONTAINED IN PASTICIDES AND FOODS THAT ARE CHANGING HARMONE LEVELS AND SHE REFERS TO VALLETS WHICH IS SPELLED PE SO IT'S BOTH OPLOIVE AND A THE SO IT'S COMBINING THE TWO AND IT'S ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT WORDS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE TO PRONOUNCE AM SECOND ONLY PERHAPS TO THE CRECT PRONUNCIATION OF OPHEMOLOGY  SO IT'S A COMMINATION OF A OF OPPLOSIVE AND ONE OF THESE THE SOUNDS AND THAT'S PROBABLY WHY IT'S DIFFICULT THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT IN FACT AM WE HAVE A TURN FOR THAT THAT'S CALLED A CONSONANT CLUSTER SO SOMETIMES SYLLABLES WHICH JUS HAVE ONE CONSONANT BUT WHEN WE START STACKING CERTAIN SYLLABLES AN A SEQUENCE AND THERE'S RULES THAT I SHOULD GOVERN WHICH CONSONANCE CAN BE INY PARTICULAR SEQUENCE FOR A GIVEN LANGUAGE AM THAT THAT MAKES A MORE COMPLICATED AND CERTAIN LANGUAGES HAVE A LOT MORE CONSNANT CLUSTERS THEN OTHER SO FOR INSTANCE SO FOR INSTANCE RUSSIAN FOR EXAMPLE HAS A LOT OF CONSANT CLUSTERS ENGLISH HAS LOT OF THEM THERE ORE THER LANGUAGES A THEHAVE VERY VERY FEW A FOR EXAMPLE AHAWIAN WHINE HAS AN INVENTORY OF ABOUT TWELVE TO FOURTEEN DIFFERENT FONIUMS FOURTEEN DIFFERENT CONSONAN AND VOWLS ENGLISH ON CONTRASSESS ABOUT FORTY A DIFFERENT CONSONANTS AND VOWS SO LANGUAGES HAVE DIFFERENT IMETORIES THEY CAN OVERLOP FOR SURE BUT DIFFERENT LANGUAGES USE DIFFERENT SOUND ELEMENTS COMBINE AND RECOMBINED THOSE ELEMENTS TO GIVE RISE TO DIFFERENT WORDS AND MEANINGS CAN WE SAY THAT THERE IS A MOST COMPLICATED LANGUAGE OUT THERE OR AMONG THE MOST COMPLE WOULD IT BE RUSSIAN I'D STEFFILY HIGH UP THERE ENGLISH IS UP THERE TOO ACTUALLY YE GERMAN TIS WELE AND IN TERMS OF LEARNING MULTIPLE LANGUAGES DURING DEVELOPMENT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IF ONE WANTS TO BECOME BY LANGUEOR TRY LINGUL BEST TO LEARN THOSE LANGUAGES SIMULTANEOUSLY DURING DEVELOPMENT IDEALLY BEFORE AGE TWELVE IF ONE HOPES TO NOT HAVE AN ACCENT IN SPEAKING THEM LATERS THAT CHORRECTOR YOU ONETE REVISES THAT LA BASICALLY THE EARLIER AND THE EARLIER IS BETTER AH THE MORE INTENS IT IS AND THE MORE IMMERS OF IT IS A THE LONGER YOU KNOW THAT YOU CAN BE EXPOSED TO THAT IS FORIMPORNT A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN GET EXPOSED FOR ALY AND BASICALLY LOSE IT EVEN THOUGH IT'S CONCLOTERING THAT SENSIVE PURED UNLESS IT'S MAINTAIN IT CAN BE VERY EASILY LOST THEN I THINK ANOTHER ASPECT OF IT THAT'S VERY INTERESTING IS AM SOME THE SOCIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR IT TOO IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT YOU CAN ONLY GO SO FAR AM JUST LISTENING TO THESE SOUNDS FROM A TAPERECORTING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THERE'S SOMETHING EXTRA ABOUT REAL HUMAN IN OUR ACTIONS THA ACTIVATES THE BRAINS SENSITIVITY TOO DIFFERENT SPEECH FOUNDS ALLOWS US TO BECOME SPECIALIZE FOR THEM FOR A GIVEN LANGUAGE SO RETURNING TO THE THE WHAT'S MAPED WHAT WHAT THE REPRESENTATIONS ARE IN THE BRAIN I'M STARTING TO GET A PICTURE NOW BASED ON THESE PLOSIVES THAN THESE TSOUNDS A AND WHAT I FIND SO INTERESTING AND LOGICAL ABOUT THAT IS IT MAPS TO THE MOTOR STRUCTURES IN THE ACTUAL PRONUNCIATION OF THE SOUNDS NOT NECESSARILY TO THE MEANING OF THE INDIVIDUAL WORDS NOW OF COURSE IT'S RELATED TO THE MEANING OF THE INDIVIDUAL WORDS BUT IT MAKES GOOD SENSE TO ME WHY SOMETHING AS COMPLEXES LANGUAGE BOTH TO UNDERSTAND AND TO GENERATE WOULD MAP TO SOMETHING THAT IS ESSENTIALLY MOTOR IN DESIGN BECAUSE IT YOU POINT OUT AGED GENERATE THESE SOUNDS AND I HAVE TO HER THEM GENERATED FROM OTHERS HOWEVER THERE'S READING AND THERE'S WRITING AND WRITING IS CERTAINLY MOTOR READING INVALVSIME MOTOR COMMANDS OF THE EYES AND ET CETERA WHERE DO READING AND WRITING COME INTO THIS PICTURE ARE THEY IN PARALLEL WITH AS WE WOULD SAY IN THEIR SCIENCE OR ARE THEY IMBEDDED WITHIN THE SAME STRUCTURES ARE THEY AM PART PART OF THE SAME SERIES OF COMPUTATIONS YE SO A TO ADDRESS THE FIRST PART IS THAT WE'VE GOT THIS MAP OF THESE DIFFERENT PARTS OF CONSIN ANCE AND VOWELS AND WHEN WE LOOK AT HOW THEY LAY OUT AND THIS STHIS PART OF TH RENDTHET WE CALL WORNACURSARY WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME REALLY JUS DISSECTING THIS MELLI MEATER BY MELIMETER THE TERM THE USE IS VERY APROPOS IT'S SOLEMN PEPPER IT'S NOT RANDOM THERE IS THIS KIND OF SELECTIVITY TO THESE INDIVIDUALS SPEEK SOUNDS AND ONE POEINT I WONT TO MAKE ABOUT IT IS THIS IS THAT AM AN ENGLISH FOR EXAMPLE THERE ABOUT FORTY DIFFERENT PHONIUMS PHONIUMS ARE JUST CONSONANTE AR VALS OR INDIVIDUAL SPEECH SEGMENTS BUT THESE ARTICULATORY FEATURES THAT YOU REFER TO FOR EXAMPLE THE CHARACTERISTIC SOUNDS THAT ARE GENERATED BY SPECIFIC MOVEMENTS IN THE MOUTH YOU CAN MORE OR LESS REDUCE THAT TO ABOUT TWELVE DIFFERENT FEATURES THESE ARE SPECIFIC MOVEMENTS OF THE TONGUE THE JAW THE LIPS THE LARINCS THEY'RE ABOUT TWELVE OF THESE MOVEMENTS IN JUST LIKE YOU SAID ANDREW BY THEMSELVES THEY HAVE NO MEANING THEY'RE JUST MOVEMENTS BUT WHAT'S INCREDIBLE ABOUT IT IS THAT YOU TAKE THESE TWELVE MOVEMENTS AND YOU PUT HIM IN COMBINATIONS AND YOU STARE PUTTING THEM IN SEQUENTS WE IS HUMANS USE THOSE TWELVE SET OF FEATURES TOO GENERATE ALL WORDS AND BECAUSE WE CAN GENERATE NEARLY AN INFINITE NUMBER OF WORDS WITH THAT CODE OF JUST TWELVE FEATURES WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT GENERATES ESSENTILLY ALL POSSIBLE MEANING BEX ATS WHAT WE DO IS HUMANS WE GENERATE MEANINGS OM TRANI COMMUNICATE ONE IDEA TO ANOTHER WHICH TO ME IS EXTRAORDINARY A PARALLEL WOULD BE FOR EXAMPLE DEANAYE THERE'S FOUR BASEPEERS IN D'ANADE BUT WITH THOSE FORCE FOUR BASEPEERS IN A SPECIFIC SEQUENTS CAN GENERATE AN ENTIRE CODE FOR LIFE IN SPEECHES THE SAME WAY IT'S LIKE YOU'VE GOT THESE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS THAT BY THEMSELVES HAVE NO MEANING BUT WHEN YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER GIVE RISE TO EVERY POSSIBLE MEANING SO WITH REGARD TO YOUR SECOND POINT ABOUT READING WRITING IT'S A FASCINATING QUESTION SPEECH AN LANGUAGE IS PART OF WHO WE ARE AS HUMANTS THAT'S A PART OF HOW WE EVOLVED AND IT'S HARD WIRE AND IU NO MOULDED BY EXPERIENCE READING AND WRITING ARE HUMAN INVENTION IT'S SOMETHING THAT WAS ADDED ON TO THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE BRAIN AND BECAUSE READING WRITING ARE FAIRLY RECENT IND HUMAN EVOLUTION IT'S ESSENTIALLY TOO QUICK FOR ANYTHING TILL I HAVE A DRAMATIC CHANGE IN LETS SAY A NEW BRAIN AREA OR SOME KIND OF SPECIALIZATION INSTEAD WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WHEN EVER ANY KIND OF BEHAVIOR BECOMES ULTRA SPECIALIZE A IN ANY OF US OR ANY ORGANISM WE WEKEN SORT OF TAKE SOME AREAS THAT ARE NORMALLY IVOLVED WITH VISION FOR EXAMPLE IN SPECIALIZE IT FOR THE PURPOSE OF READING SO ALL OF US HAVE APART OF OUR BRAIN IN THE BACK OF THE TEMPORAL OPE THAT INTERFICE WITH THE SYPITAL VISUAL QUARTEX THAT WE CALL A VISUAL WORD FORMER THERE'S ICUALLY A PART OF THE BRAIN THAT IS VERY SENSITIVE TO SEEING WORDS I LIKE EITHER TYPE DOR HANDWRIN THERE'S A PART OF THE BRAIN THAT ALSO SENSITIVE TO SING THINGS LIKE FACES I'M SO THESE ARE THINGS AT ARE ALL CONDITION ON WHAT'S IMPORTANT YOU KNOW TO SURVIVE IM SO READING AND WRITING ARE INVENTION AND THERE ARE THINGS THAT HAVE MAPPED TO FUNCTIONS OF THE BRAIN ARE READY HAS AND ONE OF THE REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS ABOUT READING WRITING IS THAT WHEN WED LEARN TO READ AND WRITE SPECIALLY WITH THE READING PART IT MAPS TO THE PARTED BRAIN THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS THE PART THAT'S PROCESSING SPEECH SOUNDS SO SOME OF US KIND OF THING ABOUT THESE ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS ONE IS HEARING SOUNDS THROUGH YOUR EARS THE OTHER IS READING WE'RE ACTUALLY SEEING THINGS THROUGH YOUR EYES AND THEN GETTING INTO LANGUAGESSM WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT THE AUDITORY SPEECH QUARTEX IS THA PRIMAL AND PRIMITIVE FUNDAMENTAL AERY THAT'S REALLY IMPORN FOR SPEECH IN WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE READING IS ONCE IT GETS THROUGH THAT VISUAL QUARTEX IT'S GOING TO TRY TO MAP THOSE READING SIGNALS TO THE PART OF THE BRAIN THAT'S TRYN MAKE SINSE OF SOUNDS THE SOUNDS OF WORDS WHAT WE CALL PHENOLOGY NOW WIS IS IMPORTANT IT IT IS A LOT OF RELEVANCE TO HOW WE LEARN TO WRITE AND IN SOME KITS WITH DISLEXIO DISELEXIIS A NEUROLOGICAL CONDITION WERE IM A CHILD IN SOME CASE AN ADULT HAS TROUBLE READING FOR EXAMPLE AND IN MANY OF THOSE CASES IT'S BECAUSE THAT MAPPING BETWEEN HOW WE SEE THE WORDS TO THE WAY THAT THE BRAIN PROCESSES THE SOUNDS IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAT PEOPLE WHO CAN READ REALLY WELL SO WHEN YOU'RE READING A LOT OF TIMES YARE ACTUALLY ACTIVATING THE PART OF THE BRAIN THAT IS PROCESSING THE WORDS A YOU HEAR WHAT IS THE CURRENT UM TREATMENT FOR DISLEIA IVE I'VE HEARD THAT IT SAY DEFISED IN SOME OF THE MOTION PROCESS IN SYSTEMS OF THE VISUAL SYSTEM YOU NOW PEOPLE R THEIR EYES ARE JUMPING AS APPOSED TO WORD WHEN YOUARE READING A  CROSS OR I SUPPOSE FO  CHINESE UBY YOU KNOW  OU PRESUME PEOPLE RE ALWAYS READING ENGLISH OR I SUPPOSE IF IT'S EE BRETHER GOING FROM THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE PAGE UM WHAT CAN BE DONE FOR DISLEXYE AND DO ANY OF THE MODERN TREATMENTS FOR DISLEXES YET INVOLVE CANE CHANGING THINGS FROM THE SPEECH SIDE I SUPPOSED JUST THET POUTN'T PAT READING SIDE GIVEN THAT SPEECH AND READING AR INTERCONNECTED YEH ABSOLUTELY SO AGAIN I THINK IN THE BEGINNING PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THITS WAS PURELY A VISUAL ABSTRACTION OR SOMETHING REALLY JUST ABOUT THE VISUAL SYSTEM BUT THERE'S BEEN MORE RECONNITION THAT IT COULD BE BOTH OR COULD BE EITHER DEPENDING ON THE PARTICULAR INSTANCE I'M IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THERE ARE MANY KITS WITH SLIKESY A WHERE THE PROBLEM IS A PROBLEM OF PHONOLOGICAL WARENESS SO I'M YOU KNOW IT CAN BE VERY HARD TO DETECT BECAUS IT MAY UNDERSTAND THE WORDS AT YOUARE SAYING BUT BECAUSE THE BRAIN IS SO GOOD AT PATTERN RECOGNITION SOMETIMES EVEN IF THE INDIVIDUAL SPESOUNDS ARE NOT CRYSTAL CLEAR IT CAN COMPENSATE THAT SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO CAN HEAR THE WORDS BUT NOT BE ABLE TO ESSENTIALLY IM HEAR THEM WHEN THEYRE READING THOSE SAME WORDS AND SO WHAT CAN HAPPEN WITH THAT IS THAT YOU CAN HAVE THIS DISCONNECTION BETWEEN ON WHAT THEYARE SEEN AND WHAT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO HER ITOUS WORDS AND PROCESS IT IS LANGUAGE AND SO SKILLED READERS IM YUSUALLY NEED THAT ROUT FIRST THEY'VE GOT A MAP THE VISION TO THE SOUND IN ORDER GET THAT SORT OF LIKE FOUNDATION BUT THEN OVER TIME THE READING HAS ITS DIRECT CONNECTION TO THE LANGUAGE PARTS OF THE BRAIND AND WE DON'T NECESSARILY ALWAYS NEEDS TO MAP TO SOUNDS YOU KNOW YOU CAN BASICALLY DEVELOP A PARALLEL ROUT AND WE AS READERS ACTUALLY USE BOTH ALL THE TIME SO FOR EXAMPLE IF IT'S A NEW WORD THAT YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE SOMETIMES YOU TRY TO LIKE PRONOUNCE IT IN YOUR MIND YOU KNOW TO N TRY TO HEAR WHAT THAT WORD IS EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY SAYING YOUR TRENGES GENERATE WITH THOSE SOUNDS MIGHT MIGHT BE LIKE AND THAT'S THE PART WHERE WE'RE KIND OF I RELYING ON HOW WE LEARN TO READ IN THE FIRST PLACE WHICH IS MAPPING THOSE WORD IMAGES TO THE SOUNDS AT YOU KNOW GO ALONG WITH THEM BUT ANOTHER TIMES IF YOU'RE REALLY PROFICIENT READER YOU'RE JUST SEEING THE WORDS AND YOU CAN MAP THEM DIRECTLY TO MEANING WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH THAT IM GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS I'M A BIG FAN OF LISTENING TO AUDIO BOOKS AND OF COURSE I ALSO LISTEN TO PODCASTS QUITE A LOT BUT I ALSO A STRONG BELIEVER BASED ON THE RESEARCH THAT I'VE SEEN THAT READING BOOKS PHYSICAL BOOKS COULD BE UNKINDALE I SUPPOSE BUT READING A PHYSICAL BOOK IT'S USEFUL FOR BEING ABLE TO ARTICULATE WELL AND STRUCTURE SENTENCES AND BUILD WHAT ARE ESSENTIALLY PARAGRAPHS WHICH IS WHAT I'VE PRIRE TO DO WHEN I DO SOLO EPISODE TO THE PODCAST I'VE NOTICED OVER THE YEARS AS TAXT MESSAGING HAS BECOME MORE POPULAR AND THERE'S A ESSENTIALLY IN TEROSION OF PUNCTUATION OR THE NEED TO HAVE COMPLETE SENTENCES AND NOW THAT SORT OF TRANSFER TO EMALE AS WELL IT'S BECOME EXACT THE BOLLDED TO SAY YOU  FRAGMENT IT SENTENCE IS ANYMALE IT IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT IT'S DARTING IMPACK THE WAY THAT PEOPLE SPEAK IS WELL AND I DON'T THINK THIS HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH INTELLIGENCE OR EDUCATION LEVEL BUT ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY EVIDENCE THA AT HOW WE READ AND WHAT WE READ AND WHETHER OR NOT WE CONSUME INFORMATION PURELY THROUGH READING OR MAINLY THROUGH AUDITORY SOURCES DOES IT CHANGE THE WAY THAT WE SPEAK BECAUSE AFTER ALL VERNICKIES AN BROK AS AREA AND THE OTHER AUDITORY IN SPEECH PRODUCTIONARY IS ART HEAVILY INTERMASHED AND SO T WOULD MAKE PERFECT SENSE TO ME THAT WHAT WE HER AND THE PATTERNS OF SOUND THERE BEING COMMUNICATED TO US WOULD ALSO CHANGE THE WAY THAT WE SPEAK YE THAT'S A REALLY FASCINATING POINT IM THERE IS THIS IDEA THAT THERE IS LIKE THIS PROPER WAY TO SPEAK LIKE THAT THERE IS THE RIGHT WAY FOR EXAMPLE IM WHAT ARE THE APPROPRIATE YOU KNOW LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IN SCHOOL IM THEU'RE OFTENTIMES TOLD LIKE YOU SHOULD SAY LIKE THIS NOT SAY LIKE THAT YOU KNOW AND EVERY LANGUAGE CONNA HAS THOT IT TURNS OUT THAT THAT'S REALLY UNNATURAL LANGUAGEIS AND SPEACH IN PARTICULAR CHANGE OVER TIME IT EVOLVES IM IN ICANEIC IT CAN HAPPEN VERY QUICKLY YOU KNOW THE THINGS THAT WE CALL DIALECTS FOR EXAMPLE ARE JUST DIFFERENT WAYS OF SPEAKING IN SOME ONE CAN JUST BEING ONE ENVIRONMENT AND CHANGE FROM ONE DIALECT TO OTHER OR IN SOME PEOPLE AT KIND OF IS IS REALLY FIXED AND THERE IS THIS IDEA THAT YOU KNOW LIKE IN SCHOOL THAT THOUGH I TOLD THAT THERE IS IS RIGHT WAY BUT IN REALITY THAT'S NOT TRUE LIKE LANGUAGE CHANGE IN SPEECH CHANGES COMPLETELY NORMAL IN HAPPENS ALL THE TIME AND IT CAN BE REALLY DRAMATIC LIKE CERTAIN CULTURES AND COMMUNITIES IF THEY ARE ISOLATED THIT CAN DEVELOP A WHOLE NEW LANGUAGE AF WHOLE NEW SAID OF OF WORDS FOR EXAMPLE NEW WAYS AND DIALECTS THAT OURE INDEPENDENT FROM PEOPLE TO THE POINT WERE IT'S UNINTELLIGIBLE EVEN TO TO TO OTHERS AND SO A THE BASIC IDEA IS THAT SOUND CHANGE IS PART OF THE WAY AT WORKS AND THE BRAIN IS VERY SENSITIVE TO THOSE KIND OF CHANGES SPEAKING OF LEARNING NEW LANGUAGES I'M ASSUMING IT'S POSSIBLE TO LEARN NEW LANGUAGES THROUGHOUT THE LIFE'S MEN DIRRECT YE I'VE ALSO HEARD THESE CAND OF FANTASTICAL STORIES OF SOMEBODY HAS A STROKE AND THEN SUDDENLY SPONTANEOUSLY CAN SPEAK FRENCH FLUENTLY WERE AS PRIOR TO THE STROKE THEY COULD NOT IS THERE ANY MERIT TO THOSE STORIES WHATSOEVER I I FIND IT VERY HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS A COMPLETE MAPPEREPRESENTATION OF A LANGUAGE IN SOMEBODY'S BRAIN THAT THEY WERE COMPLETELY UNAWARE OF AND THEN BECAUSE OF DAMAGE TO A BRAIN AREA THAT CAPACITY TO SPEAK THAT LANGUAGE WAS SOMEHOW UNVAILED IT JUST SEEMS TOO WILD AND UNLESS IT GOOD TO BE TRUE BECAUSE NOBODY WANTS A STROKE BUT IT JUST SEEMS OUTRAGEOUSLY IMPLAUSIBLE WELL THEIR ASPECTS OF THAT THAT CERTAINLY ARE IMPOSSIBLE SO I I DON'T KNOW OF ANY TRUE CASE THAT I'VE EVER EEING OR EXPERIENCE MYSELF OR EVEN READ ABOUT WHERE FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS AN INTERY TO THE BRAIN THAT A RESULT IN LOSS OF A WELL ESSENTIALLY A GAIN A FUNCTION MEANING LIKE THI ART IF JUST ALL OF US SUDNSORT SPEAKING ANOTHER LANGUAGE SO FOR EXAMPLE OF YU HAT A STROKE AND YOU NEVER SPOKE FRENCH AND THEN YOU HAD IT AND THEN ALL OF A SUN YOUR SPEAKING THAT I I'VE NEVER HEARD OF NEVER SEEN HOWEVER ATHERE IS A CONDITION THAT IS WELL ACKNOWLEDGE AND I HAVE SEEN ONE CASE OF THIS CALLED A FOREIGN ACCENT CENDRUM WHICH CAN AM IT'S PECULIAR BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE AN INTERY TO THE PART OF THE BRAIN WHERE IT SOUNDS LIKE THER STARTING TO SPEAK THIS OTHER LANGUAGE BUT THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY SPEAKING THE LANGUAGE JUST SOUNDS LIKE IT AND THIS GOES BACK TO WHAT WEERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER ABOUT THESE AREAS THAT ARE REALLY IMBORN FOR SPEACH CONTROL OF THE THE VOCAL TRACT THIS AIRE IN THE PRECENTRAL CHIRIS PEOPLE HAVE DOCUMENTED WERE I YOUR PATIENTS HAVE THAT STROKES THERE AND AFTER THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE THEIR SPEAKING SPANISH I SUPPOSED TO ENGLISH OR IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY HAVE THE INTINATIONAL PROPERTIES OF FRENCH OR RUSSIAN AS COMPARED TO THEIR ORIGINAL NATIVE LANGUAGE THEY'RE NOT LEARNING ALL THE RESVIT LIKE THE MEANING AND THE GRAMMAR ET CETERA BUT THEYRE ADOPTING SOME THE PHONOLOGY AND PART OF THAT IS JUST BECAUSE A IT'S NOT WORKING THE WAY IT NORMALLY DOES SO THERE IS SOMETHING ACTUALLY CALLED A FOREIGN ACCENT CYNDRUM THE PEOPLE GREN AVE AFTER A STROKE INTERESTED CUREIOUS AB AUDITORY MEMORY WHEN I WAS A KID I USED TO GET INTO BED AT NIGHT AND IT CLOSE MY EYES AND I WOULD REPLAY CONVERSATIONS THAT I'D HEARD DURING THE DAY OR PEOPLE'S VOICES I SHE CAN REMEMBER CALLING YOUR HOUSE WHEN WE WERE YOUNG KIDS AND BECAUSE I DON'T SPEAK ANY CHINESE BUT I'D HAVE TO ASK FOR YOU I'D SAY I THINK IT WAS AT YSI BOULT I YE YEAND THEN SOME ONE WHOEVER ANSWER THE PHONE WOULD SAY I WOULD GO GEVIN THA IS A CHISHE WHICH I BELIEVE MEANS THANK YOU RIGHT THAT'S THE TOTAL OF THE CINESE THAT I SPEAK BY THE WAY BUT I WILL NEVER FORGET HAI'LL JUST NEVER FORGET IT I HOPE I UPPOSE IF I HAVE A STROKE OR SOMETHING O THAT SORT THAT SOMEPOINT I'LL FORGET IN I WON'T KNOW THAT I'E FORGOTTEN IT BUT IN ALL SERIOUSNESS I I REMEMBER THAT TO THIS DAY I COULDN'T SPELL THAT OUT I WOULDN'T KNOW HOW CERTAINLY NOT IN CHINESE BUT AM AN EVEN A TRANSLITERATION I COULDN'T I COULDN'T DO I USING ENGLISH A LETTERS WHERE AR MEMORIES OF SOUNDS STORED BECAUSE WITHIN OUR DAYS AND ACROSS OUR LIVES WE HAVE A IINFINITE NUMBER OF AUDITORY EXPERIENCES JUST LIK WE HAVE AN INFINITE NUMBER OF VISUAL EXPERIENCES WHERE THEY STORED AND N WHAT IS THE STRUCTURE OF THEIR STORAGE WHAT WHAT AM I CALLING UPON BESIDES OF COURSE THE MOTOR COMMANDS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO SAY WHAT I JUST SAID IN CHINESE WHICH I WON'T REPEAT AGAIN ANSO IM AS YO AT REAT THE FIRST TIME FERLEAS NOT TERRIBLY WRONG THEN I DON'TT ABOT O THE SECOND TIME WHERE IS THAT STOWARD AND HOW DOES THAT WORK AND MORE IMPORTANTLY AS I SPEAK MY NATIVE LANGUAGE ENGLISH IN MY PULLING FROM A MEMORY BANK BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT I'M JUST TELLING YOU WHAT I WANT TO SAY I'M DO MY BEST TO COMMUNICATE CLEARLY AND SUSCINCTLY YOU SHALL NOT SO GOTO THE SUSCINCT PART BUT WHERE IS THE BANK OF INFORMATION ON MY KEY BORD ON MY COMPUTER I HAVE THE LETTERS AND I'VE CERTAN ELEMENTS OF PUNCTUATION IN THE SPACE WHAT AM I PULLING FROM IN MY PULLING FROM THOSE PLOSIVES BUT IF SO HOW CAN I DO IT SO QUICKLY EVEN FROR PEOPLE THAT SPEAK SLOWLY IT IT APEARS NO LESS FLUID THIS TO ME IS OVERWHELMINGLY IMPRESSIVE THAT THE BRAIN CAN DO THAT HOW DOES IT DO THAT WELL FIRST FA I'M I HAVE IMPRESS THAT THIRTY FIVE HERE LAT Y HAD TO GET HOLD OF YOU SOI I AM IMPRESSE THIRTY FIVE YOURS LATER THAT YOU CAN STILL REMEMBER THAT BUT ONLY THAT THAT'S FINE I'M STILL VERY IMPRESSIN AM BUT IT CLEARLY IT SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO YOU AND AM SO THE SHORT ANSWER IS THAT MEMORY IS VERY DISTRIBUTED SO IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE QUESTION THAT YOU ASK ME IS AM ILL POST CAUSE YOU ASK ME WHERE WHELE IT'S NOT ONE SPECIFIC ARIIT'S ICTUA REALLY DISTRIBUTED IT'S NOT JUST ONE PARTICULARY IN FACT I'VE FAIRLY CERTAIN THAT IF WE WERE TO INJURE THAT PART OF THE BRAIN CALL THE WORNIKEYS ARIA YOU MAY STILL EVEN HAVE MEMORIES OF THAT PEOPLE CAN IT HAVE IT INJURIES OF BROCUSERYOR CERTAINLY THE PRECENTRAL GIRIS AND BE ABLE TO I'M SING HAPPY BIRTHDAY FOR EXAMPLE WHEN IT'S INBEDDED IN MALADY OR HIGHLY REHEARSE THINGS LIKE COUNTING DESPITE NOT BEABLE TO SPEAK WHICH IS INCREDIBLE RIGHT IT'S LIKE YOU CAN SEE A PATIENT FOR EXAMPLE WHO CAN'T REALLY PUT TOGETHER SENTENCE YOU ASK SOMEHOW YOU FEELING TO THET CAN YOU UTTER A WORD BUT THEN YOU ASK SOME TO COUNT SOMETIMES IN THE THOY'L GET UP TO ANY NUMBER REALLY AND SO THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE REALLY BUILT IN TO OUR MOTER MEMORY AND IT'S DISTRIBUTED IT'S NOT ONE PARTICULAR PART OF THE BRAIN IT'S ACTUALLY MULTIPLE AR EAS WHERE THAT MEMORY IS DISTRIBUTE AND THANK GOD THAT'S THE WAY IT IS BECAUSE IT'S VERY RARE IN THE KIND OF SURGERIES THAT I DO WHERE YOU GO ON YOUR REMOVER PART OF PIECE THE BRAIN THAT SOME ONE FORGETS THESE KIND OF LONG TERM MEMORIES OR THESE LONG TERM MOTOR SKILLS THAT THEY HAVE THAT'S VERY VERY RARE IT'S THE NUMBER ONE QUESTION OPASION WILL ASK ME LIKE A I GOADNTO BE THE SAME AND I IIM I GONG TO REMEMBER YE MY WIFE OR I MIGT HAVE A RAN ME REMEMBER YOU KNOW THESE THOUGHTS OF MY BIRTHDAY WHEN I WAS TEN YEARS OLD AND I'VE NEVER REALLY SEEN THAT KIND OF SEVERE AND YE S UNLESS IT'S A VERY VERY SEVERE INTRY THAT INVOLVES ALMOST THE ENTIRE BRAIN AND THANK OT SO A LOT OF THAT INFORMATION IS REALLY DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE ENTIRE BRIN SPEAKING OF STORAGE OF IN ABILITY TO SPEAK I YOU ARE I'M DOING SOME AMAZING WORK AND HAVE ACHIEVED SOME I'M PRETTY INCREDIBLE WELL DESERVED RECOGNITION FOR YOUR WORK IN BRINGING LANGUAGE OUT OF PARALYZED PEOPLE ESSENTIALLY ALLOWING PEOPLE WHO ARE LOCKED IN TO A PARALYZED STATE OR OTHERWISE UNABLE TO ARTICULATE SPEECH USING BRAIN MACHINE INTERFACE ESSENTIALLY TRANSLATING THE NURL ACTIVITY OF AREAS OF THE BRAIN THAT WOULD PRODUCE SPEECH INTO HARDWARE WIRES AND AND THINGS OF THAT SORT ARTIFICIAL NON BYOLOGICAL TOOLS IN ORDER TO ALLOW PARALYZED PEOPLE TO COMMUNICATE WE WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO SOME OF THE POPULAR PRESS COVERD TOF THAT WORK IN THE ORIGINAL PAPERS BUT IM IF YOU WOULD BE SO KIND AS TO TELL US WHAT THOSE EXPERIMENTS LOOK LIKE I'M WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE WHO ARE LOCKED IN AND THAT YOU ALLOW TO COMMUNICATE AND THEN ESPECIALLY I'M INTERESTING TO ME O SOME OF THE DIRECTIONS THAT YOU'RE TAKING THIS NOW WHICH IS BEYOND JUST YOU DON'T PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT TO SAY AND WORDS COMING OUT ON A SCREEN OR THROUGH A MICROPHONE BUT ACTUALLY MAKING THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THESE PEOPLE IN THE REAL WORLD AM MORK I A LABORATE AND MORE REAL IF THAT SEEMS MYSTERIOUS TO PEOPLE I'M AN LET ADY TELL YOU WHAT I'M THEY'RE DOING WITH TUS RATHER THAN I'M PUT ANY MORE DETAIL ON IT OH  WELL THINKS FOR ASKING ABOUT THIS HAS REALLY BEEN SOME OF THE EXCITING RECENT WORK FROM THE LAB SO FOR LESS DECOATOR WE'VE REALLY BEEN FOCUSING ON THE BASIC SCIENCE MEANING TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE BRAIN EXTRACTS AND PRODUCES IM SPEECH SOUNDS AND WORKS WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THESE PARTS OF THE BRAIN IM CONTROL THESE INDIVIDUAL ELEMENTS THAT GIVE RISE TALL WORKS AND AND MEANINGS AND SO IT WAS ABOUT SIX YEARS AGO WERE WE REALIZE WE ACTUALY HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA OF HOW THIS CODE WORKS WE HAD IDENTIFIED ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS THAT WE COULD DECODE IN APLEPSY PATIENS FOR EXAMPLE WHEN ITHER LECTOROTES ON THE BRAIN THIS PART OF THEIR SURGERIES WE COULD DECODE ALL OF THE DIFFERENT CONSONENCE IN VAWISE OF ENGLISH THAT WAS ABOUT SIX YEARS AGO SO A NATURAL QUESTION WAS THIS WHICH IS IF WE UNDERSTAND THAT ELECTRICAL CODE CAN WE USE THAT TO HELP SOME ONE WHO IS PARALYZED AND CAN'T GET THOSE SIGNALS OUT OF THE BRAIN TO SPEAK NORMALLY AND THAT'S IN THE SETTING OF PEOPLE WHO ARE PARALYZE SO THERE' SERIES OF CONDITIONS A'M THE INCLUDE THINGS LIKE BRAINSTEMS STROKE THE BRAINSTEM IS THE PART OF THE BRAIN THAT CONNECTS THE CEREBRAM WHICH IS THE TOPPART DOES OUR THINKING AND OUT OF THE MOTOR CONTROL SPEECH LANGUAGE EVERYTHING AND THE BRAINSTEM IS WHAT CONNECTS THAT TO THE SPINAL CORT IN THE NERVES A GO OUT TO THE FACE ON BOCALTRACT SO IF YOU HAVE A STROKE THERE BASICALLY YOU COULD BE THINKING ALL THE WILD CREATIVE INTELLIGENT THOUGHTS YOU HAVENIN THE MIND IN THE SREBROM BUT YOU CAN'T GET THEM OUT INTO WORDS OR YOU CAN'T GET THEM OUT TO YOUR HAND TO WRITE THEM DOWN SO THAT'S A VERY SEVERE FORMER PROLYSEIS CALLED BRAINSTOMS STROKE THERE'S ANOTHER KIND OF CONDITIONS THAT WE CALL NARVEGEGENERATIVE WHERE THE NERVE CELLS AH DIE BASICALLY OR ATROPHY IN A CONDITION CALLED AH AALYZE AND THAT'S A VERY SEVERE FORM OF PRALYSIS AN IT'S EXTREME FORM PEOPLE A SENTIOU LOSE ALL VOLUNTARY MOVEMENT SUST EVEN HACKING WOULD BE A GOOD EXAMPLE OF SOME ONE WITH TAL LESS LUGARISISES HE'S AN EXAMPLE OF SOME ONE WHO HAD AH A LESS BUT NOT A GREAT EXAMPLE OF WHAT TYPICAL COURSE OF ALAS SO FOR REASON'S NOT CLEAR THE PROGRESSION OF DISEASE LARGELY STABALYZE O THE POINT WHERE HE COULD TWITCH YOU KNOWS AS ACHEK MUSCLE OR MOVE IS EYES LET'S SAY AN MOST PEOPLE IT'S VERY RAPID AH AM MANY PEOPLE THEY DIE FROM IT ACTUALLY YOU KNOW WITHIN A COUPLE YEARS O'F DACNOSIS SO YET HE LIVED A LONG TIME IN THAT HE LIVED A LONG TIME AND S LAAND IS LENDED OVERSTATE AND RIVEL EXACTLY AND A BUT HE WASN'T BREATHING YOU KNOW THROUGH A TUBE IN HIS THROAT FOR EXAMPLE BECAUSE PEOPLE WITH SEVERE ALESS THE MUSCLES TO THEIR TO THEIR DIE FRAM IN THEIR LUNGS A SENTIHY GIVE OUT AS WELL THEY GET WEKNESS ERN THAN THEY CAN'T BREATHE ANY MORE SO THAT'S ANOTHER FORM OF PARALYSIS AND SO IN OUR FIELD THESE ARE CON LICE THE MOST DEVASTATING THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN I'M NOT CAN REALLY TRY TO COMPARE IT LIKE WHAT'S WORSE YOU KNOW HAVERING BRAIN TO MURR STROK IT'S ALL BAD BUT THIS CONDITION OF WHAT WE CALL BEING LOCKED IN REFERS TO THIS IDEA THAT YOU CAN HAVE COMPLETELY INTACT COGNITION AND AWARENESSE BUT HAVE NO WAY TO EXPRESS THAT NO VOLUNTARY MOVEMENT NOBILITY TO SPEAK AND THAT IS DEVASTATING BECAUSE AH PSYCHOLOGICALLY AND SOCIALLY YOU KNOW YOU'RE COMPLETELY ISOLATED THAT'S WHT WE CALL LOCTIN CENTRO AND IT'S DEVASTATING I'VE EENG THAT THROUT MY CAREER AND IT'S REALLY HARTBREAKING BECAUSE A YOU KNOW THAT THE PERSON IS THERE BUT YOU CAN'T SEE THEY CAN'T COMMUNICATE SO WE'VE BEEN STUDYING THIS PATTERNING OF ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY FOR CONSONANCE IN VOWALS AND SINCE HE ONCE WE FEGER IT OUT A LOT OF THESE COTS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL FANETIC ELEMENTS WE TOOK A LITTLE BIT OF A DETOUR OR AT LEAST PARTED ABSERTED FOCUS ON THIS VERY SPECIFIC QUESTION FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE THESE KIND OF PARALYSES COULD WE INTERCEPT THOSE SIGNALS FROM THE BRAIN THE SEREBRAL QUARTEX AS SOME ONE IS TRYING TO SAY THOSE WORDS AND THEN CAN WE INTERCEPT THEM AND THEN HAVE THEM TAKEN OUT OF THE BRAIN THROUGH WIRES TO A COMPUTER THAT  INTERPRET THOSE SIGNALS AND TRANSOLATE THEM INTO WORDS SO ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO WE STARTED A CLINICAL TRIAL IS CALLED HE BRAVO TRIAL IT STILL UNDER WAY AND THE FIRST PARTICIPANT IN THE BRAVA TRIAL WAS A MAN WHO HAD BEEN PARALYZED FOR FIFTEEN YEARS WHEN HE HAD TWENTY WHEN HE WAS ABOUT TWENTY YEARS OLD HE CAME TO UNITED STATES O WAS ACTUALLY WORKING IN SONOMA AREA AND HE WAS IN A CAR ACCIDENT AND E ACTUALLY WALKED OUT THE HOSPITAL DAY AFTER THAT CARACCIDENT BUT THE NEXT DAY HAD A COMPLICATION RELATED TO IT WHERE HE HAD A VERY LARGE STROKE IN THE BRAINSTEM AND THAT TURNED OUT TO BE DEVASTATING HE DIDN'T WAKE UP FROM THAT STROKE FOR ABOUT A WEEK HE WAS IN A COMA FOR ABOUT A WEEK AND WHEN HE WOKE UP FROM THAT COMA HE REALYZED THAT HE COULDN'T SPEAK OR MOVE HIS ARM SURLIGS AND AS HE TOLD ME OR COMMUNICATED TO US THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING HE WANTED REALLY TO DIE AT THAT TIME COULD HE BLINK HIS EYES ORMOVE HIS MOUTH IN ANYWAY HE COULD BLINK HIS EYES HE HAD SOME LIMITED MOUTH MOVINS BUT COULDN'T PRODUCE ANY INTELLIGIBLE BEACHE WAS LIKE COMPLETELY SLURRD AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE AND HE SURVIVED THIS INJURY A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE THAT KINDSTROKE JUST ON SURVIVE BUT HE SURVIVED AND I ALSO REALISED THAT HE'S JUST AN INCREDIBLE PERSON LIKE A FORCE OF NATURE IN TERMS OF HIS OPTIMISM IN TERMS OF HIS ABILITY TO MAKE FRIENDS DESPITE HIS CONDITION THE WAY HE ACTUALLY COMMUNICATES BECAUSE HE HAS A LITTLE BIT OF RESIDUAL NECK MOVEMENTS IS THAT HE IMPROVISED AND HAD HIS FRIENDS BASICALLY BUT A STICK ATTACHED TO HIS BASEBALL CAP BECAUSE HE COULD MOVE HIS NECK HE WOULD ESSENTIALLY TYPE OUT LETTERS ON A KEYBOARD SCREEN TO GET OUT WORDS IN FACT THIS IS HOW HE COMMUNICATED WAS THROUGH DEVISED THAT HE WOULD SINCE HE PECK OUT LTTERS ONE BY ONE BY MOVING HIS NECK TO CONTROL THIS STAK ATTACHED TO HIS PASEBALL CAP HOW MANY YEARS DID HE USE THAT METHOD OF COMMUNICATION UNTI ERE ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS HE HADN'T REALLY SPOKEN FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS YEU SO AH IT WAS A DEVASTATING INJRY BUT YOU KNOW THERE SOMETHING BE SAID ABOUT AM THE HUMAN SPIRIT AND IF THERE'S ANYONE WHO EMBODIES IT IT IS POCHO THAT'S HIS NICKNAME THE FIRST PURCHASE BEEN IN OUR TRIAL AM HE HAS THAT HUMAN SPIRIT HE PERSEVERED IN FACT YOU KNOW COTHRIVE IN HIS COMMUNITY BASICALLY IN FRIENDS BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATING THIS VERY SLOW AND INEFFICIENT WAY AM MAYBE PART OF THAT SPIRIT IS WHY HE VOLUNTEERED TO BE THE FIRST PERSON IN THIS TRIAL IT WAS A CLINICAL TRIAL AN EXPERIMENT WAS A STUDY THI'S NOT AN APPROVED THERAPE BY ANY MEANS THIS WAS REALLY SOMETHING HAD NOT BEEN DONE BEFORE AND WAS WE HAD A LOT OF IDEAS ABOUT IT A BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW YOU KN WE HAD PROVE IN A LOT OF THIS COULD BE TRUE IN SOME PEOPLE WERE NORMALLY SPEAKING BUT TO ACTUALLY PUT INTO SOME ONE WHOSE PARALYZE NUMBER ONE WHER WE DON'T KNOW THE COTE IS THE SAME NUMBER TOO IS SOME ONE WHO'S NOT BEEN S BEING FOR FIFTEEN YEARS WHETHER THOS SIGNALS ARE ACTUALLY STILL THERE OR NOT SO IT WAS PART OF A CLINICAL TRIAL OS YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT OR HOSPITAL AND ALSO THE FTIER YOU KNOW HAD TO APPROVE AND LOOKED AT VERY CAREFULLY BUT GIVEN A LOT OFTHE WORK THAT WE HAD DONE THERE WERE SOME BASIS FOR FOR WHY THIS MY WORK AND SO AM ABOUT TWO AND HALF YEARS AGO WE DID A SURGERY WHERE WE IMPLANTED ELECTROSES ON TO THE PARTS OF THE BRAIN THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THESE AREAS THAT CONTROL THE VOCAL TRA THE AREAS THAT CONTROL THE LARINGS THE AIRS THAT CONTROL THE LIPS IN TONGUE AND JOB MOVEMENTS WHEN WE NORMALLY SPEAK THESE ARE AIREES THAT PRESUMABLY MAY BE ACTIVE THAT WAS OUR HOPE IN HIS BRAIN BUT HE JUST COULDN'T GET THOSE OUT TO A CONTROL HIS HIS MOUTH IN NORMAL WAY AND HE UNDERWENT A SURGERY AF BRAINSERTER WE PUT AT ELECTROT OR RAY AN WE CONNECTED IT TO A PORT THERE WAS SCULLED TO A SCREW TO HIS SKULL THE PORT ACTU GOES THROUGH HIS SCALP AND HE'S LIVED WITH HIS NOW FOR LOST THREE YEARS AM IT IS A RISK OF INFECTION THESE PORTS EVENTUALLY HAVE TO BECOME WIRELESS IN THE FUTURE BUT WE'VE FIGURET OUT AWAY TO KEEP THAT PORT THERE WHERE WE CAN ESSENTIALLY CONNECT HIM TO A COMPUTER THROUGH THAT PORT SO HE HAS AN ELECTRODE A RAY THAT'S IMPLANTED OVER THE PART OF THE BRAIN THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR SPEECH ITS CONNECTED TO A PORT AND THEN WE CONNECT A WIRE TO THAT PORT THAT TRANSLATES THOSE A WELL BECAL ANALOGUE OU KNO BRAINWAVES AND CONVERTS HIM INTO DIGITAL SIGNALS AND THEN A COMPUTER TAKES THOSE DISUAL SIGNALS FROM THOSE INDIVIDUAL SIGHTS FROM THE SPEECH QUARTEX ANTRANSLATES THOSE INTO WORDS CAN YOU DESCRIBE FOR US THE FIRST TIME THAT PONCHO SPOKE THROUGH THIS ENGINEER DEVICE OW WHAT WAS THAT EXPERIENCE LIKE FOR YOU AND AT LEAST FROM WHAT HE CONVEYED TO YOU WHAT WAS THAT EXPERIENCE LIKE FOR HIM THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO WAS ESSENTIALLY LOCKED IN EXCEPT FOR THIS YOU KNOW RATHER CRUDE PECKING DEVICEALL THO HIM THOROUGLY INPRESSED BIKE HOW ADAPTED WE'RE ADAPTABLE PONCHO WASN'T HIS FRIENDS ENGINEERING THAT DEVICE FORM WAS IS REALLY NOTHING SHORT OF OF CLEVER AN I'M BECAUSE OTHERWISE HE WOULD BE TRULY LOCKED IT YI BUT WHAT WAS THAT MOMENT LIKE I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THAT MOMENT WAS INCREDIBLE IT WAS TRUALLY INCREDIBLE IM TO BE ABLE TO SEE HIM TRY TO GET OUT OF WORD THAT WAS FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES ONINTELLIGIBLE BUT TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THE BRAIN ACTIVITY AND TO TRANSLATET AN TO TEXT ON A SCREEN THAT'S WHAT WE DID WE TOOK THOSE BRAIN WAVES WE PUT THEM THROUGH I MACHINE LEARNING OR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AUGARO THEM THAT CAN PICK UP THESE VERY VERY SUBTLE PATTERNS YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY SEE THEM WITH YOUR EYE IAN IN THE BRAIN ACTIVITY AND TRANSLATE THOSE INTO WORDS AND I REMEMBER SEEING THIS HAPPENING FOR THE FIRST TIME YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T HAPPEN LIKE IMMEDIATELY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT TOOK WEEKS TO TRAINE THE AUGARO THEM TO INTERPRET IT CORRECTLY I'M BUT WHAT WAS INCREDIBLE ABOUT IT WAS TO SEE HOW HE REACTED AND I'M HE WOULD BE PROMPTED TO SAY GIVEEM WORD LIKE I'M YOU KNOW OUTSIDE FOR EXAMPLE AND THEN HE WOULD THINK ABOUT IT TRY TO SAY IT AND FINALLY THOSE WORDS WOULD APPEAR ON THE SCREEN AND WHAT WAS REALLY AMAZING ABOUT IT WAS YOU COULD REALLY TELL THAT HE LIKE GOT A KICK OUT OF THAT BECAUSE HE WOULD START TO GIGGLE YOU KNOW HIS HIS BODY WOULD SHAKEN AWAY AND HIS HEAD WOULD SHAKEN AWAY THAT HE WOULD STAR TO GIGGLE AND THAT WAS COOL TO SEE BUT THEN I ALSO REALIZE THAT WHEN HE WAS GIGGLY A KIND OF SCREWED UP THE NEXT WORDS TO COTING IS THAT ABUG YOU'VE SINCE I Y FIXED NO WE HAVEN'T FIXED THAT INAN WE HAVEN'T FIXED THAT SO IT'S EASIER JUST TO TELL HIM TO STOP GIGGLING SO WHAT WAS THE FIRST WORD THAT HE SAID WHY THINK ONE OF THE FIRST SENTENCES THAT HE PUT TOGETHER WAS YOU KNOW CAN YOU GET MY FAMILY OUTSIDE AND YEANING GET THEM OUT OF THE ROOM ALL THESE YEARS YOU WANTED DAY AFTER HIS FAMILY NO I THINK WHAT HE MEANT WAS CAN YOU GET THRING THEM IN BR YON MAN AND SO THE WAY THIS WORK WAS WE TRAINED ATHIS COMPUTER O RECOGNIZE FIFTY WORDS WE STARTED WITH A VERY SMALL VOCABULARY IM THAT'S EXPANDING AS WE SPEAK I THINK THAT THIS IS JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THESE VOCABULARS BECOME MUCH MUCH LARGER BUT T WE STARTED WITH THE FIFTY SET OF WORDS WE CREATED ESSENTIALLY ALL THE POSSIBLE SENTENCES A YOU COULD GENERATE FROM THOSE FIFTY WORDS WHY THAT WAS IMPORTANT WAS YOU CAN USE THOSE ALL THOSE POSSIBLE SENTNCES TO CREATE A COMPUTATIONAL MODEL CON PURE MODEL OF ALL THE DIFFERENT WORD COMBINATIONS TO GIVE DIFFERENT SENENCES IM GIVEN THOSE FIFTY WORDS AND THEN YOU CAN ESSENTIALLY DO WHERE WE CALL AUTO CORRECT IT'S THE SAME KIND OF THING THAT WE DO WHEN YOU'RE TEXTING FOR EXSAMPLE YOU GET THE RIGHT THE WRONG LETTER AND THERE BUT THE YOUR FONT ACTUALLY KNOWS YOU KNOW BECAUSE THAT IT'S A CONTECTS WHAT TO CORRECTED SO BECAUSE THAT DECOTINGS NOT A HUNDRED PER SENT CORRECT ALL THE TIME E FACT IS FAR FROM THAT IT'S REALLY HELPFUL TO HAVE THESE OTHER FEATURES LIKE AUTOCRIC THE SUF THAT WE USED FOR TEENLY NOW WITH TEXTING THAT MAKES IT CORRECT AND THEN OPDATES IT SO IT'S A COMBINATION OF A LOT OF THINGS IT'S THE A IE THAT IS TRANSLATING THOSE BRAIN ACTIVITY PATTERNS AH BUT IT'S ALSO THINGS THAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM SPEECH AND SPEECH TECHNOLOGIES THAT YOU KNOW YOU PUT ALTOGETHER AND THEN ALL WAS SUNNEN STARTS TO WORK AND SO OM WE WERE REALLY EXCITED BECAUSE THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT SOMEONE WAS PARALYZED AND COULD CREATE WORDS IN SENTENCES A THAT WAS JUST TO COTED FROM THE BRAIN ACTIVEE INCREDIBLE AND I'M I KNOW YOUR VERY HUMBLE AND BUT I'M GOING T OM BARRAS YOU BI SING ALWAYS KNEW YOU WERE DESTINED FOR GREAT THINGS INCE A THE EARLY AGE OF NINE WHEN WE FIRST BECAME FRIENDS BUT I WHEN I READ THAT A THE NEWS COVERAGE OF OF YOUR WORK WITH PONCHO AN THE RELEASE OF T THIS  LANGUAGE FROM THIS LOCKED INPATION IT IM IT LITERALLY OU KNOI BROUGHT TEARS TO MY EYES BECAUSE IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S AN INTERESTING THING AS AS FELLOW NURO SCIENTISTS ARE WE WE  EXPLORE THE BRAIN AND WE TRY AND FIND MECHANISMS THAN WE AND COMPARE THOSE TO WHAT OTHER PEOPLE FIND AND FIND TRUTHS AND PRINCIPLES AND BUILD UP FROM THOSE BUT PRETTY RARELY IS THERE A CASE WHERE THAT ROUT OF EXPLORATION LEADS TO SOMETHING OF CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE WITHIN ONE'S OWN LIFETIME I'MAN THAT'S THE REALITY OF SCIENCE AND OFTENTIMES IT'S A VERY DISTRIBUTED PROCESS AND BUT IN THIS CASE I IT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN A MAGNIFICENT THING TO SEE YOU A MOVE ALON THIS TRAJECTORY PARSING THESE LANGUAGE AND SPEECH ARIOS AND THEN T ALSO DO THE CLINICAL WORK IN PARALLEL SPEAKING OF WHICH THESE DAYS WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT NURLLINK I BELON MUSKS COMPANY A NUR SURGEON THAT CAME UP BRIEFLY THROUGH MY LAT BUT I I CAN'T TAKE ANY CREDIT FOR WHAT HE KNOWS OR DOES WHICH IS A MAMAC DUGLE IS THE NURS SURGEON NURLINK THERE SOME OTHER EXCELLENT NUR SCIENTIST THERE AN ENGINEERS THERE WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT NURLINK BECAUSE AM WHILE BRING MACHINE INTERFACE OF THE SORT THAT YOU DO IN THAT OTHER LABORATORIES DOU HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG TIME AM THERE'S BEEN SOME PRESS A ROUND NURLLINK ABOUT THE PROMISE OF WHAT BRING MACHINE INTERFACE COULD DO FOR INSTANCE EARLY IN OUR DISCUSSION YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW OU NOW LANGUAGE IS CONSTRAINED BY THE SOUND WAVES AND TYPICALLY IT'S A FEW PEOPLE COMMUNICATING OR ONE PERSON WITH MANY PEOPLE YOURE PODCASTS FOR INSTANCE OR A SPEECH BUT THE IDEA 'S BEN THROWN OUT THERE THAT THROUGH THE USE OF STIMULATING CHIPS OR THROUGH OTHER BRAIN MACHINE DEVICING THAT PERHAPS ONE COULD INTERNALIZE FIFTY CONVERSATIONS IN PARALLEL FIFTY ACTS COMMUNICATION A ORE THAT ON THE MEMORY SYSTEMS COULD BE AUGMENTED TO REMEMBER TEN TIMES AS MUCH INFORMATION EVEN TWICE AS MUCH INFORMATION IN A GIVEN PERIOD OF TIME MY UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING AT NARL LENGTH WHICH IS ADMITTEDLY CRUDE AND FROM THE OUTSIDE FEW DISCUSSIONS WITH PEOPLE THERE IS THAT DAY TO ARE GOING TO PURSUE CLINICAL GOALS FIRST THINGS LIKE TRYING TO GENERATE SMOOTH MOVEMENT IN A PARKANSONIAN PATIENT TRYING TO A JUST MOVEMENT PATTERNS IN SOME ONE WITH HUNTINGTONS DISEASE FOR INSTANCE THINGS OF THAT SORT BEFORE THEY EMBARK ON THE MORE ON SI FI LIKE EXPLORATIONS OF FIFTY EXING  COMMUNICATION OR DOUBLING MEMORY CAPACITY IN THESE CONSTANCE OH I DO'T KNOW THEY MAY BE DOING ALL OF THOSE THINGS IN PARALLEL WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT SUPER CAPABILITIES OF THE BRAIN OR OR YOU SUPI I DON'T EVEN KNW WHAT WORE TO USE IS SUPERCHARGING THE BRAIN YOU KNOW GIVING THE BRAIN FUNCTIONS FOR WHICH WE'VE NEVER OBSERVED BEFORE IN HUMAN HISTORY ARE WE HAVE OUR INSTINES IN OUR FINEMENS IN ARE MERSONEX AND THE INAR AN CLEAR HER TO PUT IN ALONG THAT LINE SIDE BY SIDE BUT THERE SOME THEIR MICHAEL JORDANS AND ET CETERA BUT WE'VE NEVER HEARD OF OR SEEN SOMEBODY WHO CAN JUMP TWENTY FEET IN THEAR OR WE'VE HEARD OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE PHOTOGRAPHIC MEMORIES BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT WE ARE AWARE OF ANY HUMAN BEING IN HISTORY WHO COULD MEMORIZE THE ENTIRE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS OR ALL THE WORKS WITHIN THE VATICAN WITHIN AN HOUR ANYWAY YOU GET THE IDEA WHAT RE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT MANIPULATING NARL CIRCUITRY TO ACHIEVE SUPRA HUMAN OR SUPERHUMAN OR SUPERPHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS ARE WE THERE SHALL WEVEN BE THINKING ABOUT THAT IS IT POSSIBLE GIVEN THAT NARON SIMPLY COMMUNICATE THROUGH ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY AN ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY CAN BE ENGENEERED OUTSIDE OF THE BRAIN HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT AND HERE WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO THIN ABOUT NAURLINK IN PARTICULAR IT'S JUST BUT ONE EXAMPLE OF COMPANIES AND PEOPLE IN LABORATORIES THAT ARE QUITE UNDERSTANDLY CONSIDERING ALL THIS WELL IT'S A REALLY INTERESTING TIME RIND NOW THE SCIENCE HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR DECADES THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE WAST FEEL THAT YOU CALL BRAIN MACHINE IN OUR FACE IS BEEN GOING ON FOR A WHILE AND A LOT OF THE EARLY WORK WAS JUST TRYING TO RESTORE  THINGS LIKE OR MOVEMEN OR HAVING PEOPLE OR AMON IES CONTROL A COMPUTICERSOR FOR EXAMPLE ON THE SCREEN THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR TACATES UM WHAT'S BEEN REALLY NEW IS THAT INDUSTRY IS NOW INVOLVED IN SOME SOME OF THIS NOW BECOMING COMMERCIALIZED AND WERE SERTING TO SEE US NOW CROSS OVER TO THIS FIELD WHERE IT'S NO LONGER JUST RESEARCH THAT WE'RE TIGMOUNT MEDICAL PRODUCTS UM THAT OUR DESIGNED TO BE YOU KNOW SURGICLLANE PLANTED IN SOME CASES YOU KNOW THERE'S PEOPLE DOING THIS KIND OF WORK NONEVASIVELY AS WELL OH THEY DON'T REQUIRE A SURGERY UM THE SPECIFIC QUESTION THAT YOU ARE ASKING ABOUT IS AN AIRA THAT WE CALL AUGMENTATION SO CAN YOU BUILD A DEVICE UM THAT ESSENTIALLY ENHANCES SOME ONE'S ABILITY BEYOND SUPERBNORMAL SUPERMEMORY SUPER COMMUNICATIONS SPEEDS BEYOND SPEECH FOR EXAMPLE UM I GUESS SUPERIOR UH PROCISION ATHLETICABILITIES I THINK THAT THESE ARE VERY SERIOUS KIND OF QUESTIONS TO BE ASKING NOW BECAUSE AS YOU MENTION THE PATHWAY SO FAR AS REALLYT TO FOCUS ON THESE MEDICAL APPLICATIONS I PERSONALLY DON'T THINK THAT WE'VE THOUGHT ENOUGH ACTUALLY ABOUT WHAT THESE KIND OF SENERIAS ARE GON LOOK LIKE AND I DON'T THINK WE'VE THOUGHT THROUGH ALL THE ETHICAL IMPLICATIONS OF WHAT THIS MEANS FOR AUGUMENT AUGMENTATION IN PARTICULAR UM THERE'S PART OF THIS THAT IS NOT NEW AT ALL HUMANS THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE BEEN DOING THINGS TO AUGMENT AR FUNCTION COFFEE NICOTINE ALL KINDS OF THINGS ALL KINDS OF MEDICATIONS THAT CROSS OVER FROM MEDICAL TO CONSUMER THAT IS EVERYWHERE SO THE PURSUIT OF AUGMENTATION OR PERFORMANCE ARE ENHANCEMENT IS REALLY NOT A NEW THING UM THE QUESTIONS REALLY AS THEY RELATE TO NARROW TECHNOLOGIES FOR EXAMPLE HAVE TO DO WITH THE INVASIVE NATURE FOR EXAMPLE IF THESE TECHNOLOGIES REQUIRE SURGERY FOR EXAMPLE TO DO SOMETHING THAT IS NOT FOR A MEDICAL APPLICATION AGAIN THERE THAT IS NOT EXACTLY NEW TERRITORY EITHER PEOPLE DO THAT ROUTINELY FOR COSMETIC IN PROCEDURES FOR PHYSICAL APPEARANCE NOT NESURLY COGNITIVE SO I DO THINK THAT PROVIDED THE TECHNOLOGY CONTINUES TO EMERCH THE WAY THAT IT DOES THAT IT'S GOIN TO BE AROUND THE CORNER IN IT PROBABLY'S NOT IN MANWAYS THAT ARE SUPEROBVIOUS I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE CAN WE EASILY MEMORIZE EVERY FACT IN THE WORLD BUT IN FORMS THAT ARE GOING TO BE MUCH MOR INCREMENTAL MAY BE MORE SUBTLE UM IN MANY WAYS WE ALREADY HAD THAT NOW LIKE FOR EXAMPLE YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A NORL ENTERVASE INVEDED IN YOUR BRAIN TO GET INFORMATION THE SENTRY ACCESS TO ALL INFORMATION IN THE WORLD I JUST HAVE TO HAVE YOU KNOW YOUR EYE FOUGT WHETHER YOU COULD DO IT FASTER THROUGH A BRAIN IN HER FACE I DEAFLLY ONE RULE THOUT OUT BUT THINK ABOUT THIS THAT THE SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE ALREADY TO SPEAK IN TO COMMUNICATE HAVE EVOLVED OVER YOU KNOW THOUSANDS O MILLIONS OF YEARS AND THEY'RE SUPPORTED BY NORL STRUCTURES THAT HAVE BAN WITH OF MILLIONS OF NORANS THERE IS NO TECHNOLEDGY THAT EXIS RIGHT NOW THAT PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT THAT ARE IN COMMERCIAL FORM CERN LIGHT NOT EVEN IN RESEARCH LOBS THAT COME ANYWHERE CLOSE TO WHAT HAS BEEN OF OLVE FOR THOSE NATURAL PURPOSES SO I MUST SENC YOU SAYING TO SIDES OF THIS WHICH IS WERE ALREADY GETTING INTO THIS NOW THIS IS NOT NEW TERRITORY THIS TOPIC OF AUGMENTATION BOTH FHASICAL AND COGNITIVE WE'VE ALREADY SURPASS THAT THAT'S PART OF WHAT HUMANS DO IN GENERAL AM BUT WE ARE ENTERING THIS AREA OF LIKE IN H HANDS COGNITION A THESE AREAS THAT I THINK THE TECHNOLOGIES CIN TO BE THE REAT LIMITING STEP AND HOW FAR CAN GO WE HAVE NOT HAD THE FULL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT NUMBER ONE IS THIS WHAT WE ACTUALLY WANT AH IS THIS CANGTO BE GOOD FOR SOCIETY WHO GETS ACES TO THIS TECHNOLOGY THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT ARE AN BECOME REAL WORLD PROBLEMS CERTAINLY LOT TO CONSIDER IN THINKING ABOUT AUGMENTATION AND ANOTHER THEME THAT I'VE YET TO ASK YOU ABOUT BUT EM EXTREMELY CURIOUS ABOUT WHICH IS FACIAL EXPRESSIONS AM BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MUSCULATURE OF THE FACE AND LANGUAGE AND THE COMMUNICATION OF EMOTION AM I'D LOVE FOR YOU TO IF YOU WOULD I TOUCH ON A LITLE BIT OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH PATIONS LIKE PONCHAU TO MOVE BEYOND A SOMEBODY WHOSE LOCKED IN BEING ABLE TO TYPE OUT WORDS ON A SCREEN WITH THEIR THOUGHTS THERE IS A RICH ARRAY OF INFORMATION CONTAIN WITHIN THE FACE AND FACIAL EXPRESSION AND WHILE SOMEBODY LIKE PANCHOU GOING FROM HAVING TO YOU KNOW BE COMPLETE LOCKED IN TO BEING ABLE TO PACK OUT LETTERS ON A KEEP BOULD TO BEING ABLE TO JUST THINK OF THOSE LETTERS AND HAVING THEM SPELLED OUT THAT'S A A TREMENDOUS SET OF LEAPS FORWARD TOWARDS NORMAL SEA IT'S STILL FAREIGN AWAY DIFFERENT THEN PANCHO SPEAKING WITH HIS MOUTH WHICH I THINK AM KNOWING SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE RESTRICTED UM YOU'RE QUATROPLEGIC YOU KNOW A LOT OF WHAT THEY STRUGGLE WITH IN THE YOWHAT IS ACTALY ACTUALLY A HEIGHT DIFFERENT SOMETIMES BECAUSE THEY'RE SEATED WHILE OTHER PEOPLE ARE STANDING ESPECTUALLY WE DON'T OFTEN THING ABOUT THIS BUT ALWAYS HAVE TO LOOK UP TO COMMUNICATE WITH PEOLES VERY DIFFERENT INTERFACE IN THE WORLD AM THEY MANAGE QUITE WELL OF COURSE BUT AM COULD HE TELLS WHAT YOU'REDOING IN TERMS OF MERGING THE BRIN MACHINE IN HER FACE WITH EXTRACTION OF SPEECH SIGNALS FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE LOCKED IN LIKE PONCHAU WITH FACIAL EXPRESSIONS SURE YE WELL LIKE WE DESCRIBE BEFOR PROGRESS IS BEING MADE AM THE PROOF OF PRINCIPLE IS OUT THERE THAT YOU CAN TO COAT SPEECH THAT WILL CONTINUE O OPTIMIZE AND I'M VERY CONFIDENT T THAT'S GOIN IMPROVE VERY VERY QUICKLY IN THE COMING YEARS TO THE POINT WHERE IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW NOT JUST A SMALL VOCABULARY BUT A LARGE VOCABULARY AND A REASONABLE RATES IT A LEVEL THAT'S CAN BE REALLY HELPFUL VERY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THAT I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT TIME TO START REALLY THINKING ABOUT A BROADER VISION OF WHAT COMMUNICATION REALLY IS SO FOR EXAMPLE AI'M HERE WITH YOU IN PERSON WE COULD HAVE DONE THIS VIRTUALLY PROBABLY PRETTY EASY TO DO THAT WE COULD AVE RECORDED THIS REALLY SEPARATE BUT THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT BEING ABLE TO ACTUALLY SEE YOUR EXPRESSIONS AND TO UNDERSTAND IM OTHERE R FORMS OF COMMUNICATION SO ANOTHER REALLY IMPORTANT ONE IS NON VERBAL THEXPRESSIONS AT YOU'RE MAKING YOU KNOW A FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE A QUIZZICAL LOOK ON YOUR FACE IF I'M SAYING SOMETHING NOT CLEAR THAT'S A SIGNE TO ME THAT I NEED TO REPHRASE IT OR TO SAY IN DIFFERENT WAY OR SLOW DOWN FOR EXAMPLE OR IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT REALLY EXCITES YOU I WANTED CONTINUE TO SAY MORE ABOUT IT AND AND TALK MORE IN DETAIL YOU KNOW SINCIALLY ABOUT I GIVEN THINGS SO A FACIAL EXPRESSIONS ACTUALLY ARE REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THE WAY WE SPEAKING THERE'S TWO THINGS A IT'S NOT JUST THE EXPRESSIONS OF LIKE HOW YOUR FEELING IN PERCEIVING WHAT I'M SAYING BUT IT'S ALSO SEEING MY MOUTH MOVE IN YOUR EYES ACTUALLY SEE MY MOUTH MOVE IN MY JAW MOVE IN A PARTICULAR WAY THAT ACTUALLY ALLOWS YOU TO HEAR THOSE SOUNDS BETTER SO HAVING BOTH THE VISUAL INFORMATION BUT ALSO THE SOUNDS GO INTO YOUR BRAIN IS CAN IMPROVED INTELLIGIBRIALLILY ALSO MAKE IT MORE NATURAL AND MEM A MEMORY FOR WHAT IS SPOKEN PERHAPS SO HERE'S A CALL FOR PEOPLE  NOT JUST LISTENING TO POT GASBUT WATCHING THEM AND LISTENING TO THE MON YOU TO I SUPPOSE IF IF WE WERE TO TO TRANSLATE THIS TO EXACTLY REAL WORLD EXACTLY AND THE REASON WHY WERE ALSO VERY INTERESTED IN THIS IDEA OF NOT JUST HAVING TEXT ON HE SCREEN BUT ESSENTIALLY A COMFULLY COMPUTER ANIMATED FACE LIKE AN AVATAR OF THE PERSONS SPEECH MOVEMENTS IN THERE FICIAL EXPRESSIONS IT'S GOING TO BE A MORE COMPLETE FORM OF EXPRESSION NOW YOU CAN IMAGINE RIGHT NOW THAT MIGHT JUST BE SOME ONE LOOKING AT A COMPETER SCREEN INTERPRETING THESE SIGNALS BUT I THINK THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING THE NEXT A COUPLE OF YEARS A LOT MORE OF OUR SOCIERY INTERACTIONS MORE THAN EVEN NOW ARE CAN A MOVING TO THIS DIGITAL VIRTUAL SPACE AND OF COURSE MUST WE BORE THINKING ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS FOR MOST CONSUMERS BUT IT ALSO HAS REALLY IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE TO SAYABLED RIGHT AND WHETHER HOW HOUARE THEY CAN A PARTICIPATE IN THAT ANSO WE ERE THINKING REALLY ABOUT FOR PEOPLE LIKE PONCH AN OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE PARALYZE WHAT OTHER FORMS OF PECIE EYE CAN WE DO IN ORDER TO HELP IMPROVE THEIR ABILI TO COMMUNICATE SO ONE IS A SENTUALY BUILDING OUT MORE HOLISTIC AVATARS NO THINGS I CAN ESSENTIALLY ATO CODE YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY THEIR THEIR EXPRESSIONS OR THE MOVEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR MOUTH IN JA WHEN THEY ACTUALLY SPEAK TO IMPROVE THAT COMMUNICATION SA DOU INVISION AT TIME NOT TOO LONG FROM NOW WHERE INSTEAD OF TWEETING OUT SOMETHING IN TEXT MY AVATAR WILL ELSE TILL TYPE IT OUT BUT MY AVATAR WILL JUST SAY IT IT'LL BE AN IMAGE OF MY AVATAR SAYING WHATEVER DIS I HAPPEN TO BE TWEETING IT THEM THAT'SWELL WORKING ON YE SO I DON'T THINK THAT THAT THAT IS GOIN HAPPEN ANDS CAN HAPPEN SOON AND THERE'S LOT OF PROGRESS AND THAT IN AGAIN WE'RE JUST TRYING TO ENRICH A THE THE FEELD OF YOU KNOW OF COMMUNICATION EXPRESSION A TO MAKE IT MORE NORMAL AND WE ACTUALLY THINK THAT HAVING THAT KIN AVATAR IS A WAY OF GETTING FEED BACK TO PEOPLE LEARNING HOW TO SPEAK THROUGH A A SPEECH NARRAL PROSTHETIC THAT'S THE DEVICE THAT WE CALL SUSPEECH IN AR PROSTHETIC THAT THAT IS GOING TO BE THE WAY THAT CAN HELP PEOPLE LEARN HOW TO DO IT THE QUICKEST NOT NECESSARILY LIKE TRYING TO SAY WORDS IN HAVING IT COME ON A SCREEN BUT ACTUALY HAP PEOPLE EMBODY FEEL LIKE ITS PART OF THEMSELVES OR THAT THEY ARE DIRECTLY CONTROLLING THAT THAT ILLUSTRATION OR ANIMATION THIS IDEA OF AN AVATAR UM SPEAKING OUT WAL WE WULD OTHERWISE RIGHT I IS FASCINING TO ME ON INSTOGRAM I I POST VIDIOS I DON'T FILTER THE BUT I KNOW THERE'S A LOOF DISCUSSION OW IS ABOUT PEOPLE USING FILTERS TO MAKE THEIR SKIN LOOK DIFFERENT OR THE LIGHTING LOOK DIFFERENT A LOT OF FILTERING AND ALSO THE USE OF CAPTION SO THAT A SENTURY WHAT YOU END UP WITH IS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN AN ACTUAL RAVIIO OF WHAT WAS SPOKEN AND AN AVATAR VERSION OF IT I MEAN THAT IF THE MISMATCH BETWEEN WHAT SPOKEN AND WHAT'S IN THE CAPTION IS TO DRAMATIC THEN IT DOESN'T QUITE WORK BUT I WATCH THESE CAREFULLY WHEN PEOPLE USE CAPTIONS AND M OFTENTIMES THERE'S A SMOOTHING OF WHAT WAS SAID INTO THE APTION SO IT SEEMS MUCH MORE SUSINCTAN AN ACCURATE OFTENTIMES THAT IT'S THE REVERSE IS ALSO TRUE WHERE THE CAPTION IS INACCURATE AND THEN IT CREATES THIS CUT OF A JARRING MISS MATCH IN ANY CASE I THINK THIS THIS ASPECT IN THE CLINICAL REALM OF USING AN AVATAR TO ALLOW PEOPLE LIKE PONCHO TO SUNCHAL BE A FACE THAT COMMUNICATES THROUGH SPILKING LANGUAGE FROM AN AVATAR THAT LOOKS LIKE THEM IS FASCINATING IN AND AM INDEED IMPORTANT AND I THINK HOW AVATARS EMERGE IN A SOCIAL SPACES AS CAN BE REALLY FASCINATING I GET A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT STUTTER I THINK THAT FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVASTUTTER IT IS ITSELF ANXIETY PROVOKING IS STUDTER RELATED TO ANXIETY IF ONE HAS A STUTTER WHAT CAN THEY DO THE STUTTER REFLECT AM UNDERLYING NEAR LOGIC IM PHENOMENON THAT MIGHT DISTINGUISH RECHING ONE CAN O STUTTER IN ANOTHER M WHAT CAN PEOPLE STUTTER DO IF THEY LIKE TO RELIEVE THEIR STUTTER YO GREAT QUESTION STUTTER IS E CONDITION WERE THE WORDS CAN'T COME OUT FLUENTLY SO YOU HAVE ALL THE IDEAS YOU'VE GOT THE LANGUAGE IN TACT YOU REMEMBER WE TALKED ABOUT THIS DISTINCTIN BETWEEN LANGUAGE AND SPEECH STUTERINGIS A PROBLEM OF SPEECH RIGHT SO THAT IDEAS THE MEANINGS THE GRAMMERIT'S ALL THERE IN PEOPLE STUTTER BUT THEY CAN'T GET THE WORDS OUT FLUENTLY SO THAT'S A SPEECH CONDITION AND I'M PARTICULAR IT'S CONDITION THAT TAFFECTS ARTICULATION SPECIFICALLY ABOUT CONTROLLING THE PRODUCTION OF WORDS IN THIS REALLY CORDINATE KIND OF MOVEMENTS THAT HAPVE TO HAPPEN IN THE VOCAL TRACT TOO PRODUCE FLUENT SPEECH AND AM STUTTERING IS A CONDITION WERE AM PEOPLE HAVE A PREDISPOSITION TO IT SO THERE IS AN ASPECT OF STUTTERING YOU ARE A STUBTERER OR YOUR NOT A STUTTERER RIGHT BUT PEOPLE WHO STUTTER DON'T STUTTER ALL THE TIME EITHER SO YOU COULD BE A STUTTER WHO STUTTERS IT'S SOMETIMES BUT NOT OTHERS AND REALLY THE THE MAINLINK BETWEEN STUTERING ANXIETY IS THAT ANXIETY CAN PROVOKE IT AND MAKE IT WORSE THAT'S CERTAINLY TRUE BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY CAUSE BY ANXIETY CAN E SENTIY TRIGER IT OR MAKE IT WORSE BUT IT'S NOT THE CAUSE OF IT PERSAY SO THE CAUSE OF IT IS STILL REALLY NOT CLEAR BUT IT DOES HAVE TO DO WITH THESE KIND OF BRAIN FUNCTIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT EARLIER WHICH IS THAT IN ORDER TO PRODUCE NORMAL FLUENT SPEECH WE'RE NOT EVEN CONSCIOUS OF WHAT IS GOING ON IN OUR MOUTHS IN OUR ALARICS WE'RE NOT CONSCIOUS AN IF WE WERE WED NOT BE ABLE TO SPEAK BECAUSE IT'S TOO COMPLEX IT'S TOO PRECISE IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE REALLY A DEVELOPED THE ABILITIES TO DO WHEN WE DO NATURALLY WHEN IT'S PART OF OUR PROGRAMMING IN PART OF WHAT WE LEARN INHERENTLY IN NATE NENO IT'S JUST THRUE EXPOSURE SO STUTTERING IS I IIS ESSENTIALLY A BREAK DOWN IT'S CERTAIN TIMES IN THAT MACHINERY BE ABLE TO WORK IN A REALLY COORDINATED WAY YOU CAN THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW THE OPERATIONS OF THESE AREAS THAT ARE CONTROLLING THE VOCAL TRACT LET'S SAY SPEECHES LIKE A SYMPHONY IN ORDER FOR TO COME OUT NORMALLY YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE NOT JUST ONE PART THE LARINCS BUT THE LIPS THE JAW THEY CAN'T BE DOING THEIR OWN THING THEY HAVE TO BE VERY VERY PRECISELY ACTIVATED VERY VERY PRECISELY CONTROLLED IN A WAY TO ACTIU CREATE WORDS AND SO IN STUTTERING THERE'S A BREAK DOWN OF THAT QU NATION IF SOMEBODY HAS A STUDDER IS IT BETTER TO ADDRESS THAT EARLY IN LIFE WHEN THERE'S STILL NAURO PLASTICITY AT IS VERY ROBUST AND IF SO WHAT'S THE TYPICAL ROUTE FOR TREATMENT I HAVE TO MEGINEIS NOT RAIN SURGERY TYPICALLY I'M I'M GUESSING THEIR SPEECH THERAPIS THAT THE PEOPLE CAN TALK TO AN AND AN THEY CAN HELP THEM WORK OUT WHERE THE'RE GETTING STOCK IN THE RELATIONSHIP TO ANXIETY YEH EXACTLY I MEAN PART OF IT IS ABOUT THAT ANXIETY BUT A LOT OF IT REALLY HAS TO DO WITH IM THERAPE TO SORT OF LIKE WORK THROUGH AND THINK OF TRICKSPASICALLY SOMETIMES TO CREATE CONDITIONS WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALL GET THE WORDS TO COME OUT A LOT OF SOME FORMS OF STUTTERING ARE REALLY INITIATION PROBLEMS I'M JUST GETTING STARTED ITSELF IS IS VERY HARD YOU WANT IT START WITH INITIAL VOWL OR CONSONENT BUT IT WON'T ADMIT IM AND SO A LOT OF THAT THERAPY IS REALLY JUST FOCUSSING A LIKE HOW DO YOU CREE THE CONDITIONS YOU KNOW FOR THAT TO HAPPEN THERE'S ANOTHER ASPECT TO IT THAT I FIND VERY INTERESTING IS THAT I'M THE FEED BACK ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE HEAR OURSELVES SAY FOR EXAMPLE I IN EVERY TIME THAT I SAY A WORD I'M ALSO HEARING WHAT I'M SAYING SO THAT'S WHAT WE CALL AUDITORY FEED BACK THAT TURNS OUT TO BE VERY IMPORTANT AND SOMETIMES WHEN YOU CHANGE THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE TEMOUNT SOMEONE STUTTERS FOR BETTER FOR WORSE AND IT IT'S GIVING US A CLUE THAT THE BRAIN IS NOT JUST FOCUSD ON SENDING THE COMMANDS OUT BUT IT'S ALSO POSSIBLY INTERRACTING WITH THE PART THAT IS HEARING THE SOUNDS AND THERE'S SOMETHING MIGHT BE GOING ON AN THAT CONNECTION THAT THAT BREAKS DOWN WHEN STUTERING OCCURS SO THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS THAT OUR STUTTERS BUT THEY DON'T STUTTER ALL THE TIME IN THOSE INSTANCES THERE SOMETHING HAPPENING THOSE PARTICULAR MOMENTS WHERE THIS VERY VERY TOS PRECISE CORNATION NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN THE BRAIN ORDOR GET THE WORDS OUT FLUENTLY WE TALK ALUBIT ABOUT KAFFENE AND WHY YOU AVOID IT BECAUSE YOUR WORK REQUIRES SUCH PRECISION AND CALM AND FRACTLY TO ME IT SEEMS LIKE YOURE RUNNING A LOT OF OPERATIONS AND AND NO PUN INTENDED IN PARALLEL WHEN YOUARE DOING SURGERY NOT JUST THINKING ABOUT WHERE TO DIRECT THE INSTRUMENTS BUT ALSO THINKING LIKE A CHESTPLAYER SEVERAL STEPS DOWN THE LINE WHAT CUND HAPPEN WHAT IF IF THEN TYPE THINKING O WHATARE SOME OF THE OTHER PRACTICES AND TOOLS THAT YOU USE TO PUT YOURSELF INTO STATE FOR OPTIM OL NER SURGERY OR FOR I'M YOU DON'T THINKING ABOUT SCIENTIFIC PROMS FOR THAT MATTER AND WE KEEP THREATENING YOU RUNNING TOGETHER BUT I KNOW YOU RUN CORRECT YOURE YE IM IS YOU FIND RUNNING TO BE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF YOUR I'M STATE REGULATION ABSOLUTELY YA SO FOR ME IM MOST ECXERCISE THAT I DO I REALLY DON'T DO FOR PHYSICAL RECENT IT DO I FOR MENTAL RECENTE I I CAN TELL FOR EXAMPLE IF I DON'T GO ON A RUN OR A SWIM JUST AFTER A DAY OR TWO AND IT CAN HAVE TRANSLATION FOR EXAMPLE AND THE WAY I FEEL IN THE OPERATING ROOM OR EVEN THE WAY INTERACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE SO THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THOSE IU NOW THE MIND EBODY ARE DEEPLY CONNECTED AND FOR ME PERSONALLY BE ABLE TO 'M HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCONNECT FOR A WHILE IT TURNS OUT TO BE REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT NOW THE OPERATING ROOM FOR ME IS ANOTHER SPACE I'M CONA LIKE RUNNING OR SWIMMING WHERE I'M DISCONNECTED FROM THE WORST THE WORLD I DON'T BRING MYSELF ON INTO THE OPERING ROOM I'M I'M DISCONNECTED FROM THE EXTERNAL WORLD FOR THAT TIME THAT I'M IN THE SURGERY AND ALL I AM DOING IS JUST FOCUSING NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT I'M HAVING COMPLEX THOUGHTS OR DOING SOMETHING VERY COMPLICATED SOMETIMES IT IS LIKE THAT BUT IT'S NOT ALWAYS LIKE THAT I'M THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE DO IN SURGERY THAT AR LIKE ROUTINE ND WROTE AND ARE FROM MUSCLE MEMORY SO FOR EXAMPLE SUITURING SKIN O OR AS DOING CERTAIN KINDS OF DISECTION OR DRAWING PART OF THE BONE FOR EXAMPLE THESE ARE ALL THINGS HAVE BECOME VERY WROTE AFTER A TIME SO FOR ME EVEN BE IN THE OPERATING ROOM ACTE CAN SOMETIMES O FILL THAT PURPOSE SO I REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO BE IN THE OPERATING ROOM BECAUSE THAT INTENSE FOCUS ALLOWS ME TOIS OR DISCONNECT FROM ALL THE OTHER THINGS I'M WORRYING ABOUT YOU KNOW THAT I'M THAT ARE HAPPENING ON THE OUTSIDE WORLD YOU KNOW WE ALL HAVE THOSE KIND OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN AND I'M CERTAINLY NO EXCEPTION TO THAT BUT STRANGELY TH OPERATING ROOM FOR ME IS A SANCTUARY I LOVE BEING THERE I' BECAUSE WE HAVE SOME CONTROL OVER THE ENVIRONMENT 'M I KNOW WHAT IS THERE I KNOW THE ANATOMY OF THE BRAIN I'M MY MOTIONS ARE GOING THROUGH ROUTINES AND SO FOR ME THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY VERY DIFFERENT THAN GOING ON A RUN AND LATTING MY YOU KNOW LIKES 'M MOVIN SPECIFIC WAYS IT'S S JUST THE SAME THING FOR FOR MY HANDS YOU LISTEN TO MUSIC OR AUDIO LOOKS WHEN YOU RUN OR YOU DIVORCED FROM TO ACKNOWLEDGY WHEN YOU RUN WELL A MUSIC HELPS ME LIKE JUS STAY MOTIVATED IN DISTRACTED FROM BEING OUT O BREATH AND AN OTHER THINGS AND FOR ME IT'S A WAY JUST TO CATCH UP WITH LIKE THE WORLD SO SOMETIMES I DO BUT I DO NOTICE THAT LIKE I DON'T RUN AS WELL FOR EXAMPLE IN THE OPERATING ROOM IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT YOU KNOW DIFFERENT SURGEONS AVE PREFERENCES I'M MORE OF OV A THE CAMP

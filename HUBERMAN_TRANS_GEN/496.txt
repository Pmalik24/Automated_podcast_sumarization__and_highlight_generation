WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LAPONEN A SCIENCE SCIENCE PACE TWEENCE  IN I MENDER HUBERMEN AND ON A PROFESSOR OF NEURABOLOGY AND OPTHOMOLOGY AT STAMPORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY WE ARE TALKING ALL ABOUT THE SCIENCE OF GRATITUDE IN PART WERE DOING THIS BECAUSE OF THE UPCOMING THANKS GIVING HOLIDAY WHICH OF COURSE IS ALL ABOUT GIVING THANKS GRATITUDE BUT ALSO BECAUSE THERE'S NOW A WEALTH OF DATA SHOWING THAT HAVING IN EFFECTIVE GRATITUDE PRACTICE CAN IMPACT A HUGE NUMBER OF HEALTH VARIABLES BOTH MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL HEALTH IN POSITIVE WAYS THINGS LIKE CARTY OVASCULAR HEALTH THINGS LIKE RELATIONSHIPS THINGS LIKE MENTAL HEALTH THINGS LIKE PHYSICAL AND COGNIVE PERFORMANCE AND THESE ARE NOT SMALL EFFACUIES ARE VERY LARGE POSITIVE EFFECTS HOWEVER IN RESEARCHING THIS EPISODE I WAS COMPLETELY SURPRISED AS TO WHAT CONSTITUTES IN EFFECTIVE GRATITUDE PRACTICE I I THINK LIKE MANY OF YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT AN EFFECTIVE GRATITUVE PRACTICE SIMPLY INVOLVES WRITING DOWN A FEW THINGS OR MANY THINGS THAT WERE GRATEFUL FOR OR THINKING ABOUT THOSE OR REALLY MAKING AN EFFORT TO SOMMATISIZE OR FEEL SOME OF THE ELEMENTS OF GRATITUDE WHILE WRITING OUT THAT LIST OR THINKING ABOUT THAT LIST AN TURNS OUT THAT IN EFFECTIVE GRATITUDE PRACTICE DOESN'T RESEMBLE THAT AT ALL THE NEURO IMAGING DATA THE PHYSIOLOGICAL DATA LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE INFLAMMITORY MARKERS OTHER STUDIES PURELY LOOKING AT THE PSYCHOLOGY AND THE LONG AND SHORT FROM EFFECTS OF AND EFFECTIVE GRATITUDE PRACTICE POINT TO A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT APPROACH TO USIN GRATITUDE TO POSITIVELY IMPACT HEALTH MECTRICS FORTUNATELY THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN ALL DO VERY EASILY SOME OF TEM ARE ACTUALLY A FUN OW YOU CAN DO THEM A IN A VARIETY OF CONTECTS SO TO DAY WEARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE SCIENCE OF EFFECTIVE GRATITUDE PRACTICES AND WE ARE GOING TO DESCRIBE WHAT THOSE ARE AND HOW YOU CAN INCORPORATE THEM INTO YOUR LIFE BEFORE WE DIVE INTO TODAYS TOPIC I JUST WON A HIGHLIGHT A PARTICULARLY INTERESTING SET OF FININGS FROM THE LITERATURE THIS IS A STUDY THAT CAME OUT IN THE JOURNAL SELL REPORT SELL PRESS JOURNAL EXCELLENT JOURNAL IT'S VERY RELEVANT TO TO DAY'S TOPIC FACT WERE GOIN TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH THIS PAPER LOBIT LATER IN THE EPISODE THE STUDY INVOLVED HAVING SUBJECTS LISTEN TO A STORY THE SUBJECTS ARE ALL LISTENING TO THE SAME STORY BUT THOSE SUBJECTS ARE NOT LISTENING TO IT TOGETHER THEY'RE NOT ROUNDED UP IN A CIRCLE ARE ALL IN A ROOM THEI'RE IN SEPARATE ROOMS OR ENTIRELY SEPARATE LOCATIONS ON THE PLANET OR THEY ARE ACTUALLY BROUGHT INTO THE LABORATORY ON SEPARATE DAYS WHAT THIS STUDY FOUND IS THAT DIFFERENT SUBJECTS LISTENING TO THE SAME STORY UNDERGO THE SAME VARIATION IN HEART RATE IN OTHER WORDS THE GAPS BETWEEN THEIR HEART BEATS START TO RESEMBLE ONE ANOTHER IN RESPONSE TO THE SAME STORY NOW THIS IS VERY INTERESTING THIS IS A CORDINATION OF THE PHYSIOLOGY OF THE BODY IN RESPONSE TO A NARRATIVE A STORY INDIFFERENT PEOPLE AND YET WHEN THEY LINE UP THE HEART RATES OF THESE DIFFERENT PEOPLE WHO LISTEN TO THE STORY COMPLETELY DIFFERENT T IMES THEY FIND THAT THOSE HEART RATES MAP ON TO ONE ANOTHER ALMOST IDENTICALLY IS REALLY REMARKABLE WEE GON TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS IN TERMS OF CORDINATION OF NEURAL CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN AND NEURAL CIRCUITS IN THE BODY AND THE ORGANS SUCH AS THE HEART BUT ALSO THE LUNGS AND OTHER ORGANS OF THE BODY AND WHAT THIS MEANS FOR CHANGING ONE'S OVER ALL STATE A KEY THENE THAT'S GOING TO COME UP TO DAY AGAIN AND AGAIN IS THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN TRAITS WHICH ARE PERVASIVE ASPECTS OF WHO WE ARE AND HOW WE TEND TO REACT TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND STATES WHICH ARE MORE TRANSIENT THEY TEND TO A YOU KNOW YOU CAN INVOKE A STATE IN SOMEBODY AV STATE OF FEAR OR A STATE OF RELAXATION BUT WHAT THIS STUDY REALLY STARTS TO POINT TO IS THAT THEIR SPECIFIC APPROACHES THAT ANY OF US CAN TAKE IN ORDER TO REALLY REWIRE OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM SUCH THAT WE ARE CALMER IF WE WANT TO BE CALMER IN CIRTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE ARE MORE RESPONSIVE IN CIRTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES IF THAT'S OUR GOAL SO WE'LL RETURN TO HOW ONE WOULD GO ABOUT DOING THAT I THINK THESE A RESULTS ARE JUST BEAUTIFUL IN THE SENSE THAT THEY REALLY SHOW THAT OUR BRAIN IN OUR BODY ORE HIGHLY CORDINATE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE LISTENING TO THE STORY IN THE HEART RATE IS ON CHANGING IN RESPONSE TO THE STORY BUT THAT THERE IS A A WHAT WE CALL A STERIOTIPE A A SOR OF STEREO TYPED RESPONSE TO A GIVEN STORY IN MY MIND THERE WAS NO REASON WHY THE RESULTS HAD TO BE THIS WAY IN OW TWO PEOPLE LISTEN TO THE SAME STORY WHY SHOULD THEIR HEART RATES BE ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THE SAME STORY VERY VERY INTERESTING IN POINTS TO THE POWER OF NARRATIVE AND STORY IN CORDINATING OUR PHYSIOLOGY AND THIS IS SOMETHING POWERFUL THAT WE CAN LEVERAGE BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FOM MY TEACHING AND RECEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COST TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TODAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS ATHLETIC GREENS LETIC GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THE REASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS ON THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETI GREENS ONCE OR TWICE TO DAY IS THAT IT HELPS ME COVER ALL MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGHT HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH OUR VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GUP MICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WITH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSENTALY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITHOUT LETIC GREENS THIT GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED AND THE PROBIICS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIOM IF YOU LIKE TO TRIAT LETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY'L GIVE YOU FI FREE TRAVEL PACS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THREE K TOO THERE ARE TON OF DATAD NOW SHOWING THAT VITEMEND THREE IS ESSENTIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH EVEN IF FORE GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICIENT INVITEEMEN D THREE AND K TOO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CARDYOVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATLETIGREENSTOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FIVFORY TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VIDEMINDY THREE CATUDE TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DONT THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOES OF ELECTROLITES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR OF TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLL OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLITES FOR NERVE SELF FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AND ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOES ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEM CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLITES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IFHYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMON SYSTEMS GO OFF OURE ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOUR GETTING THE PROPARATIOS OF ELECTROLITES IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEEMENT DOC COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND YOUL GET A FREE ELEMENT SAMPL PACK WITH YOUR PURCHACE THEIRE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT A TRY ELEMEN YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENTE DOK CAM SLASH HUBERMEN LET'S TALK ABOUT GRATITUDE AND TO BEGIN I LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THE VARIOUS ASPECTS OF MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH THAT HAE BEN SHOWN TO BENEFIT FROM A REGULAR GRATITUDE PRACTICE THEIR STUDYS SHOWING THAT PERFORMING A GRATITUDE PRACTICE TWICE OR THREE TIMES OR EVEN JUST ONCE A WEEK CAN LEAD TO A PERVASE OF A LONG LASTING IMPACT ON SUBJECTIVE WELL BEING PEOPLE REPORT FEELING HAPPIER MORE MEANING JOY EVEN AWE FOR THEIR LIFE EXPERIENCES SIMPLY IN RESPONSE TO ADDING A GRATITUDE PRACTICE THE KEYTHING IS IT HAS TO BE THE RIGHT GRATITUDE PRACTICE AND WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT WITH THE RIGHT GRATITUDE PRACTICE LOOKS LIKE AND JUST A LOW BIT BUT THERRE OUR ADDITIONAL BENEFITS OF A GRATITUDE PRACTICE THEIR STUDYS SHOWING THAT A REGULAR GRATITUDE PRACTICE CAN PROVIDE RESILIENTE TO TRAMA IN TWO WAYS IT CAN PROVIDE A REFRAMING AND RESILIENTS TO PRIOR TROMATIC EXPERIENCES SO BUFFERING PEOPLE AGAINST THE NEGATIVE A PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS AN PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF EARLIER TRAMA BUT ALSO INOCULATING THEM IN MANY WAYS TO ANY TRAMAS THAT MIGHT ARRIVE LATER IN LIZE THAT'S A POWERFUL THING AND TO DAY WHAT WE WILL TALK ABOUT HOW THAT' S ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH IS ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH BY SHIFTING THE WAY THAT THE FEAR AND DEFENSE NETWORKS IN THE BRAIN ACTUALLY FUNCTION WILL GET RIGHT DOWN INTO THE DETAILS OF THAT THE OTHER THING THAT A GRATITUDE PRACTICE DOES IS ITS BEEN SHOWN TO BENEFIT SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS BUT NOT JUST FOR THE RELATIONSHIP IN WHICH YOU EXPRESS GRATITUDE RIGHT SO ON THE FACE OF IT YOU MIGHT THINK O KAY IF I EXPRESS GRATITUDE FOR SOMEBODY OVER AND OVER OVER AND OVER OVER AND OVER THEN I'M GINGTO FEEL BETTER ABOUT THAT PERSON AND INDEED THAT IS ONE EFFECT OF A GRATITUDE PRACTICE THAT'S CALLED A PRO SOCIAL OR INTER SOCIAL GRATITUDE PR RACTICE BUT THERE ARE NOW SEVERAL STUDIES RECENTS TUDIES IN GOOD JOURNALS POINTING TO THE FACT THAT A REGULAR GRATITUDE PRACTICE CAN ALSO ENHANCE ONE'S SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS ACROSS THE BOARD IN THE WORKPLACE AT SCHOOL AT WITH FAMILY IN ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS AND EVEN ONE'S RELATIONSHIP TO THEMSELVES WHICH IS REALLY WHAT THE SUBJECTIVE FEELINGS TO WELL BEING ARE SO IT'S CLEAR TO ME THAT AN EFFECTIVE GRATITUDE PRACTICE HAS AN OUTSIZED EFFECT ON MANY MANY ASPECTS OF MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HELF AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE COMING TO THIS CONVERSATION THINKING GRATITUDE PRACTICE A THAT'S KIND OF WISH YOU WASHY OR WOO ITS CAN INVOLVING ON PUTTING YOUR HAND ON YOUR HARD AND FEELING INTO ALL THE AMAZING THINGS THAT YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE EVEN WHEN THINGS ARE REALLY TERRIBLE THAT'S NOT WHERE WE'RE GOING AT ALL AND EQUALLY IMPORTANT IS TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE NEUROCHEMICAL THE ANTI IN FLAMATORY AND THE NEURL CIRCUIT MECHANISMS THAT GRATITUDE CAN INVOKE ARE EQUALLY ON PAR WITH SOME OF THE EFFECTS OF PHARMACHOLOGY OF THINGS LIKE HY INTENSY INTERVAL TRAINING AND EXERCISE AN OTHER THINGS THAT WE THINK OF IS KIND OF MORE POTENT FORMS OF SELF INTERVENTION SO IF YOU ARE OF THE MIND SET THAT A GRATITUDE PRACTICE IS KIND OF WEAK SAUCE O BUCKLE UP BECAUSE THE DATE ACTUALLY POINT TO THE FACT THAT A GRATITUDE PRACTICE IS A VERY VERY POTENT WAY IN WHICH YOU CAN STEER YOUR MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HELTH IN POSITIVE DIRECTIONS AND THAT THOSE EFFECTS ARE VERY LONG LASTING BEFORE WE DIVE INTO THE TOOLS AND MECHANISMS AND SIGNTIFIC STUDIES AROUND GRATITUDE LIKE TO TO SET THE FRAME WORK FOR THE DISCUSSION GRATITUDE IS WHAT WE CALL A PROSOCIAL BEHAVIOR OR A PROSOCIAL MIND SET NOW YOU CAN BE GRATEFUL FOR SOMETHING WITHOUT I INVOLVING ANYBODY ELFE SO THE SOCIAL PART ISN'T MEAN TO CONVEY ANYTHING ABOUT INTERPERSONAL RELATIONS ALTHOUGH IT CAN AND TO DAY WE ARE GING TO TALK A LOT ABOUT HOW INTERPERSONAL RELATIONS CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO GRATITO PRACTICE IN REALLY POWERFUL WAYS BUT PROSOCIAL BEHAVIORS ARE BASELY ANY BEHAVIOR OR MODE OF THINKING THAT ALLOW US TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER PEOPLE INCLUDING OURSELVES NOW PROSOCIAL IS NOT JUST A NAME THAT WE GIVE THESE DIFFERENT TOOLS AN PRACTICES IN MIND SETS THERARE ACTUALLY NOURAL CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY WIRED FOR PRO SOCIAL THOUGHTS AND BEHAVIORS AND THESE ARE DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN THAT ARE INVOLVED IN DEFENSIVE BEHAVIORS SO WITHOUT GETTING INTO TOO MUCH DETAILE JUST YET WE WILL LATER WE HAVE CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN THAT ARE WHAT WE CALL A PETTET IF THEY ARE DESIGND TO BRING US CLOCER TO THINGS AND TO BRING US INTO CLOCER RELATION TO THE DETAILS OF THAT SENSORY EXPERIENCE NOW THAT COULD BE A DELICIOUS FOOD THAT YOUR EATING IT COULD BE INTERACTING WITH A LOVED ONE IT COULD BE INTERACTING WITH A FRIEND OR ANY ONE YOU HAPPEN TO LIKE IT COULD EVEN BE IN RELATION TO YOURSELF THESE CIRCUITS THAT WEE CALLING PROSOCIAL CIRCUITE LIGHT UP IN THE BRAIN IN NUR IMAGING MEANING THE NURONS ARE FIRING MORE ACTIVELY MORE ELECTRICALLY O ROBUSLY AH ITS WOR OF LIKE TURNING UP THE THE VOLUME ON THESE NERAL CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN AND THE NORL CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH AVERSIVE WERE DEFENSIVE BEHAVIORS THINGS LIKE BACKING UP THINGS LIKE COVERING UP THE VITAL ORGANS OF THE BODY THINGS LIKE A QUAKING OF THE VOICE ALL THE THINGS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH DEFENSIVE BEHAVIORS ARE ACTUALLY ANTAGONIZED MEANING THEY ARE REDUCED WHEN THE PROSOCIAL CIRCUITS ARE MORE ACTIVE SO THE FRAMEWORK HERE THAT I LIKE TO SET IS THAT WE HAVE THIS KIND OF SEA SAW OF NERAL CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN ONE SET THAT AR PRO SCOCIAL AND ARE DESIGNED TO BRING US CLOSER TO OTHERS INCLUDING OURSELVES CLOSER TO CERTAIN SENSORY EXPERIENCES RIGHT BECAUSE A LOT OF PROSOCIAL BEHAVIORS CAN ALSO BE GEARED TOWARDS THINGS LIKE PETS OR FOOD OR ANYTHING THAT WE FIND WE WANT TO BE CLOSER TO AND WANT MORE OF WHEREAS THE DEFENSIVE CIRCUITS INVOLVE AIRIES OF THE BRAIN YES SUCH AS AREAS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN FEAR BUT ALSO AREAS OF THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT ARE LITERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH FREEZING OR WITH BACKING UP SO THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT GRATITUDE IS THAT FALLS UNDER THIS CATEGORY PROSOCIAL BEHAVIORS WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO BRING US CLOSER TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF THINGS AND TO ENHANCE THE LEVEL OF DETAIL THAT WE EXTRACT FROM THOSE EXPERIENCES NOW THE EXISTENCE OF THESE TWO NERAL CIRCUITS THAT HAVE PLACED ON THIS A SORT OF A METAPHORICAL SEA SAW IF YOU WILL RUNS COUNTER TO A LOT OF THE MESSAGING OR THE IDEAS THAT WERE PUT FORTH IN THE LAST CENTURY ABOUT THE PSYCHOLOGY OF HAPPINESS AND GRATITUDE VERSES  THE THE PSYCHOLOGY OF DEPRESSION AND STRUGGLE AND CONCERN ABOUT THE FUTURE BUT I LIKE TO READ A QUOTE FROM THE GREAT AND WE SHOULD WE REALLY SHOULD CALL HIM THE GREAT SIGMAN FROID BECAUSE OF DESPITE A HAVING A CERTAIN A TRAITS THAT PEOPLE A CRITICIZE HIM OF A FROID WAS INDEED A GENIUS ABOUT MANY ASPECTS OF PSYCHOLOGY BUT I JUST WHEN WE A READ YOU FROID STANCE ON HAPPINESS AND THIS INVOKES ELEMENTS OF GRATITUDE AS WELL NDTHEN YOU CAN ONGAGE FOR YOURSELF QUOTE OUR POSSIBILITIES OF HAPPINESS ARE ALREADY RESTRICTED BY OUR CONSTITUTION HE SAYING THAT WERE BASELY WIRED TO NOT HAVE HAPPINESS EASILY UNHAPPINESS IS MUCHLESS DIFFICULT TO EXPERIENCE WE ARE THREATENED WITH SUFFERING FROM THREE DIRECTIONS ONE FROM OUR OWN BODY WHICH IS DOOMED TO DECAY AND DISSILLUSION AND WHICH CANNOT EVEN DOO WITHOUT PAIN AND ANXIETY AS WARNING SIGNALS TO FROM THE EXTERNAL WORLD WHICH MAY RAGE AGAINST US WITH OVERWHELMING AND MERCILESS FORCES OF DESTRUCTION AND THREE AND FINALLY FROM OUR RELATIONS WITH OTHERS THE SUFFERING OF WHICH FROM THIS LAST SOURCE IS PERHAPS MORE PAINFUL TO US THAN ANY OTHER THAT SIGMAN FROID AND NOT ALL F HIS WRITINGS WERE A THAT PESSIMISTIC IF YOU WILL WHAT FROID IS REFERRING TO THERE ARE THOSE DEFENSIVE CIRCUITS AND OF COURSE HE TALKED ABOUT PSYCHOLOGICAL DEFENSEVES AND IN FULL DISCLOSURE I MAY HUGE FAN OF MUCH OF THE PSYCHOLOGICAL LITERATURE AND PSYCHOANALYSIS OF SIGMAN FROID AND HIS DESCENDANTS A YONG IN OTHERS I THINK THERE ARE STRONG ELEMENTS OF TRUTH THERE BUT IT GIVES YOU A SENSE OF THE GON OF MIND SET OF PSYCHOLOGY EARLY IN THE LAST CENSURY AND THEN OF COURSE WAS THE EMERGENCE OF THE POSIVE PSYCHOLOGY MOVEMENT WHICH WAS REALLY ABOUT INVOKING THE UNDERSTANDING AND EVENTUALLY THE OM ELLUCIDATION OF THE NEURL CIRCUITS FOR THINGS LIKE HAPPINESS AND AWE AND AFFILIATION AND THINGS THAT WE ARE CALLING PRO SOCIAL CIRCUTS SO THE FIELD OF PSYCHOLOGY HAS A DARKEND LIGHT A IF YOU WILL AND THE FIELD OF NEOURL SCIENCE HAS A DARKEND LIGHT THE HAVE THESE WHAT WE CALL PARALLEL PATHWAYS IN THE BRAIN AND WE HAVE PARALLEL PATHWAYS IN THE MIND THAT SET US UP FOR FEELING GOOD ABOUT THINGS OR FOR FEELING LESS GOOD ABOUT THINGS I THINK WHAT'S REALLY SAILIENT FROM THE QUOTE FROM FROID IS THAT WHAT HE SING IS OUR DEFAULT IS TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FUTURE TO BE A RAPPED IN OUR DEFENSES AND TO SOME EXTENT THAT'S TRUE AND THE REASON WE CAN SAY THAT'S TRUE IS BECAUSE MOST OF US NEED A GRATITUDE PRACTIS WE NEED TO DO CERTAIN THINGS IN ORDER TO FEEL GOOD AND TO FEEL HAPPY WE ACT LE HAVE TO PUT WORK INTO IT IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT THEREIS IN A SYMMETRY IN THE WAY THAT THESE PROSOSHAL VERSES DEFENSIVE CIRCUITS ARE SET UP SUCH THAT BECAUSE DEFENSIVE CIRCUITS ARE DESIGNED TO KEEP US SAFE PSYCHOLOGICALLY IN PHYSICALLY SAFE THAT THEY HAVE MORE ROBUSTNESS OR THEY CAN ACTUALLY DRIVE OUR BEHAVIOR MORE EASILY I GIVE YOU AN ANALOGY IN THE SYSTEM THAT UNMOST FAMILIAR WITH AS ANAUROL SCIENTISTS WHICH IS THE VISUAL SYSTEM IN THE VISUAL SYSTEM WE HAVE PARALLEL PATHWAYS WE HAVE NURONS IN OUR EYE THAT RESPOND WHEN THINGS IN OUR ENVIRONMENT GET BRIGHTER LITERALLY WHEN THE LIGHTS GO UP THESE N ARE ON START FIRING LIKE CRAZY AND WE HAVE NURONS IN OUR EYE THAT RESPOND WHEN THINGS GET DARKER WHEN THINGS START DIMMING OR GO FROM WHITE TO BLACK THE CIRCUITS FOR DETECTING DARKENING ARE MUCH MORE ROBUST AND MUCH MORE NUMEROUS THAN ARE THE CIRCUITS FOR BRIGHTNESS AND THAT IS PROBABLY RELATED PROBABLY TO THE FACT THAT DARK OBJECTS OR EXPERIENCING LOOMING MEANING INCOMING OBJECTS AND BEING ABLE TO PERCEIVE THEM IS SOMETHING THAT'S VITAL TO OUR SURVIVAL WHEREAS BEING ABLE TO PERCEIVE THE BRIGHTENING OF THINGS MIGHT BE IMPORTANT SURVIVAL IN CERTAIN CONTECTS YOU KNOW CARLIGHTS COMING OUT YOU ANIGHT OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT BUT NOT AS OFTEN IN ANY KIND OF A EVOLUTIONARY OR ETHOLOGICAL CONTECTS AS THE DARKENING OF THINGS SO I THINK FROIDS QUOTE AND THE FIELD OF PSYCHOLOGY NOW POINT TO THE FACT THAT INDEED WE HAVE THE CAPACITY FOR HAPPINESS AND WE HAVE THE CAPACITY FOR GREAT WORRY AND CONCERN AND DEPRESSION AND UNHAPPINESS AND THE NAURL CIRCUIT LITERATURE ALSO SUPPORTS THAT THE KEY THING FOR TODAY'S DISCUSSION IS THAT GRATITUDE TURNS OUT TO BE ONE OF THE MOST POTENT WEDGES BY WHICH WE CAN INCERT OUR THINKING AND AS YOU ALSO SEE ARE THE PHYSIOLOGY OF OUR BODY BETWEEN THESE TWO CIRCUITS AND GIVE A LITTLE MORE LEVITY IF YOU WILL TO THE SIDE OF THE SEA SAW THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH POSITIVE PRO SOCIAL FEELINGS AND IF YOU KEEP IMAGINING THE SEA SAW IMAGERY WHAT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL ABOUT GRATITUDE PRACTICES IS THAT IF THEIR PERFORMED REPEATEDLY AND NOT EVEN THAT OFTEN BUT REPEATEDLY THAN ONE CAN ACTUALLY SHIFT THEIR NEURL CIRCUITS SUCH THAT THE SEA SAW THAT O'N CALLING PROSOCIAL VERSES DEFENSIVE BEHAVIORS CAN ACTUALLY START TO TILT AND THE LITTLE HINGE IF YOU WILL ON THE SEA SAW IN THE MIDDLE CAN BE ADJUSTED IN LILL TIGHTER WHEN THE SIDE FOR GRATITUDE AND FOR WELL BEING AND FOR FEELINGS OF HAPPINESS IS A LITTLE BHIGHER WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT WHETHER NOT FROID WAS RIGHT OR WRONG WHETHER OR NOT A THE NEUROL SCIENTISTS ON HAT IN ONE CAMP OR ANOTHER RIGHT OR WRONG WE NOW KNOW WITH CERTAINTY THAT A REGULAR GRATITUDE PRACTICE CAN SHIFT THE PROSOCIAL CIRCUITS SO THAT THEY DOMINATE ARE PHYSIOLOGY AN OUR MINDS SET IN WAYS THAT CAN ENHANTS MANY MANY ASPECTS OF OUR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH BY DEFAULT SO WE DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO CONSTANTLY BE IN PRACTICE TRYING TO BE HAPPY SO THAT SUSCENT WAY OF SAYING ALL THIS IS YES INDEED WE MIGHT BE WIRED OR IN SUCH THAT WE HAVE A GREATER PROPENSITY FOR UNHAPPINESS THAN HAPPINESS BUT GRATITUDE PRACTICES PROVIDED THEY ARE THE EFFECTIVE ONES THAN THE ARE PERFORMED REGULARLY CAN SHIFT THOSE CIRCUITS SUCH THAT WE ARE HAPPIER ON AVERAGE EVEN WHEN WE ARE NOT PERFORMING THOSE PRACTICES NOW ID LIKE TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE NEUROL CHEMISTRY AND NEURAL CIRCUITS ASSOCIATE WITH GRATITUDE AND PROSOCIAL BEHAVIORS NUMEROUS TIMES ON THIS PODCAST IAVE TALKED ABOUT SO CALLED NEUROMODULATORS THOSE OF YOU THAT MIGHT HAVE FORGOTTEN NERVE NEVER HEARD OF NERMODULATORS BEFORE NEURMODULATORS ARE CHEMICALS THAT ARE RELEASED IN THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT CHANGE THE ACTIVITY OF OTHER NEURAL CIRCUITS THEY MAKE CERTAIN BRAINAIR IS MORE LIKELY TO BE ACTIVE AND OTHER BRAINAIRIES LESS LIKELY TO BE ACTIVE THESE NEURMODULATORS HAVE NAMES LIKE DOPAMING CERETONAN A SEAT OFCOLIN UP ANEFERAN AND SO ON THE MAIN NEUROMODULATORS ASSOCIATED WITH GRATITUDE AND PROSOCIAL BEHAVIORS TENDS TO BE CERETONAN CERETONAN IS RELEASED FROM A VERY SMALL COLLECTION OF NURONS IN THE BRAINSTEM CALLED THE RAFE ARE A P H E THE RAPHING NUCLIUS AND A FEW OTHER PLACES IN THE BRAIN AND THE RAPHE NEURON SEND THESE LITTLE WIRES THAT WE CALL ACTS ONS OUT TO NUMEROUS PPLACES IN THE BRAIN AND THEY TEND TO INCREASE THE ACTIVITY OF PARTICULAR NEURL CIRCUITS THAT LEND THEMSELVES TO MORE APPROACH TO PARTICULAR TYPES OF EXPERIENCES THAT MAKES TOTAL SENSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT HAVE A CHEMICAL THAT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES RELEASED IN THE BRAIN THAT TRIGGERS THE ACTIVITY OF NEURL CIRCUITS THAT MAKES THE ORGANISM YOU MORE LIKELY TO STAY IN AN INTERACTION WITH SOMETHING OR EVEN LEANING AND SEEKA MORE DETAILED INTERACTION WITH THAT PERSON PLACEOR THING BEAUTIFUL WORK FROM A HOGNIVE NEUROL PSYCHOLOGIST HIS NAME IS ANTONIO DEMASSIO IS A A WORLD CLASS NER SCIENTISTS HAS BEEN IN THE GAME OF VERY LONG TIME HAS EXPLORED THE SO CALLED NEURL QUARRELETES OF GRATITUDE AND TWO MAIN BRAIN AREAS ARE ACTIVATED WHY THESE CERTONERGIC SYSTEMS AND WHEN PEOPLE EXPERIENCE SOMETHING THAT MAKES THEM FEEL GRATITUDE EVEN IF ITS SHALLOW GRATITUDE OR DEEP PEN IF IT'S ALL THE WAY TO DEEP GRATITUDE THEY SEE ACTIVATION OF THESE PARTICULAR BRAIN CERCUITS ILE MENTION IN A MOMENT AND THE AMOUNT OF ACTIVATION SCALES WITH HOW INTENSELY THE PERSON EXPERIENCE THE FEELING OF GRATITUDE AND THOSE TWO AREAS HAVE PARTICULAR NAMES YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW THE NAMES BUT FOR THOSE OF EITHEY WANT TO KNOW THEY ARE THE ANTERSINIALIC QUARTEX AND THE MEDIOL PREFRONTAL QUARTEX AND OF COURSE THESE BRAINARIES ARE CONNECTED TO A NUMBER OF OTHER NETWORKS IN THE BRAIN IN FACT THAT'S HOW THEY GET YOU OR OTHERS TO LEAN INTO CERTAIN EXPERIENTE EXPERIENCES BECAUSE WHEN THESE AREAS ARE ACTIVE CERTAIN THOUGHT PROCESSES GET INVOKED THOSE THOUGHT PROCESSES PROBABLY RESEMBLE SOMETHING LIKE I'D LIKE TO EXPERIENCE MORE OF THIS ARE THIS FEELS REALLY GOOD AND THEN THEY LITERALLY FEED ON TO YOUR MUSCLES VIO THE NURONS MAKING YOU HAPPY TO STAYSTATIONARY IF YOUR EXPERIENCING SOMETHING YOU LIKE OR TO MOVE CLOSER TO SOMETHING THAT YOU FIND ATTRACTIVE TO YOU LITERALLY SO THESE ARE POWERFUL CIRCUITS OF THESE TWO BRAIN AREAS THE ONE I LIKE TO FOCUS ON THE MOST IS THE MEDIOL PREFRONTAL QUARTEX MANY VIEWU HAVE PROBABLY HEARD OF THE MEDIAL PREFRONTAL QUARTEX BECAUSE THIS IS THE AREA OF THE BRAIN THAT IS INVOLVED IN PLANNING AND IN DEEP THINKING AND EVALUATION OF DIFFERENTYPES OF EXPERIENCES PASS PRESENT OR FUTURE IT SEEMS ACTUALLY THAT PRETTY MUCH EVERY STUDY OF A HUMAN ANY THING SEEMS TO INVOLVE THE MEDIAL PREFRONTAL QUARTE RELEAST ONE COULD GET THAT IMPRESSION A JUST BY LOOKING A SCIENTIFIC ABSTRACTSON AND PAPERS THESE DAYS SO I THINK IT'S WORTH US TAKING STEPACK IN ASKING WHAT IS THE MEDIOL PREFRONTAL QUARTEX REALLY DO RIGHT HOW COULD THIS ONE PIECE OF NRL REAL ESTATE THAT WE ALL HAVE  BEHIND OUR FOREHEAD HOW COULD THAT BE INVOLVED IN SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS AND THE REASON IT CAN BE INVOLVED IN SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS AND THE REASON IT'S ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR GRATITUDE IS THAT MEDIOL PREFRONTAL QUARTEX SETS CONTEXT K IT SETS CONTEXT AND IT LITERALLY DEFINES THE MEANING OF YOUR EXPERIENCE NOW THIS IS NOT AT ALL IN ABSTRACT PHENOMENON I MIN OT GIVE A VERY PHYSIOLOGICAL EXAMPLE OF THIS AND THEN WE ARE GOING TO TRANSLATE IT TO GRATITUDE BUT I REALLY WANT EVERYONE TO UNDERSTAND HOW IS IT THAT MEDIL PREFRONTAL QUARTEX SETS THE CONTEXT OF EVERYTHING IN YOUR LIFE WELL IT DOES IT THE FOLLOWING WAY YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF CIRCUITS DEEPER IN YOUR BRAIN THAT SIMPLY CREATE SAMD SENSATIONS OR THEY ALLOW YOU I SHOULD SAY TO PERCEIVE CERTAINT SENSATIONS LET'S USE THE EXAMPLE OF COLD EXPOSURE SOMETHING THAT WE'D SOMETIMES TALK ABOUT IN THIS POTCE SS FOR OTHER REASONS IF YOU WERE TO DELIBERATELY PLACE YOURSELF INTO AN ICE BATH IT WOULD BE UNCOMFORTABLE EVEN IF YOUARE ADAPTED TO COLD AND SO FORTH THE DISCOMFORT IS NON NEGOTIABLE HOWEVER IF YOU ARE DOING IT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO OR BECAUSE YOU HAVE KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE PARTICULAR HEALTH BENEFITS THE MEDIO PREFRONTAL QUARTECS CAN THEN CONTROL AREAS OF YOUR DEEPER BRAIN LIKE THE HYPOTHALMIS TO POSITIVELY IMPACT THE NURROW CHEMICALS THAT ARE RELEASED INTO YOUR SYSTEM YOU'LL STO GET A LOT OF A DRENALINE BY GETTING INTO THE ICE BATH BUT THE FACT THAT YOU ARE DOING THIS DELIBERATELY AND YOUR KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE MAKING THE CHOICE THAT IT'S YOU THAT'S DECIDING TO PUT YOURSELF THROUGH THIS DISCOMFORT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO CREATE A VERY DIFFERENT AND POSITIVE EFFECT ON THINGS LIKE DOPAMINE ON THINGS LIKE ANTI INFLAMMATORY MARKERS AH IN YOUR MUN SYSTEM ET CETERA COMPARED TO IF SOME ONE PUSHES YOU INTO AN ICE BATH OR IF YOU ARE DOING IT BECAUSE SOME ONE INSISTS THAT YOU DO IT AND YOU REALLY REALLY DON'T WANT TO SO THERE'S A VERY SUBTLE DISTINCTION HERE IT'S JUST AS IT'S JUST THE DISTINCTION OF MOTIVATION AND DESIRE OR LACK OF MOTIVATION AND BEING FORCED INTO SOMETHING AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER EFFECTS OF THIS THAVE BEEN UN DESCRIBED IN THE EPISODE WITH ROBERTS OPOLSKI H THAT I DID EARLIER A THIS LAST YEAR HE TALKED ABOUT IT A STUDYING ANIMALS WHICH HAS ALSO BEEN SHOWN IN HUMANS IF YOU TAKE A MOUSE FOR INSTANCE IND IT RUNS ON A RUNNING WHEEL WHICH MIGHTS REALLY LIKE TO DO THERE MANY POSIVE EFFECTS ON REDUCING BLOOD PRESSURE IMPROVEMENTS IN NOR CHEMISTRY ET CETERA IN THAT MOUSE HOWEVER IF THERE'S A MOUSE IN THE CAGE RIGHT NEXT TO IT THAT'S TRAPPED IN THE RUNNING WHEEL AND T HAS TO RUN EVERY TIME THE OTHER MOUSE RUNS CAUSE THE WHEELS ARE LINKED WILL THEN THE SECOND MOUSE THAT'S FORCED TO DO THE EXACT SAME RUNNING EXPERIENCES NEGATIVE SHIFTS IN THEIRE OVER ALL HEALTH METRICS BLOOD PRESSURE GOES UP STRESS HORMONES GO UP ET CETERA BECAUSE IT'S NOT ACTUALLY MAKING THE CHOICE MEDIO PREFRONTAL QUARTECS IS THE NOB IT IS OR THE SWITCH RATHER THAT CAN TAKE ONE EXPERIENCS AND ALLOW US TO FRAMENT SUCH THAT IT CREATES POSITIVE HEALTH EFFECTS AND THE EXACT SAME EXPERIENCE FRAMED AS SOMETHING WE DON'T WANT TO DOER THAT WE ARE FORCED TO DO CAN CREATE NEGATIVE HEALF EFFECTS NOW HOW EXACTLY THE NURON TO MEDIOL PREFRONTAL CORTECTS DO THAT IS RATHER COMPLICATED AND FRANKLY NOT COMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD BUT IT SOMEHOW ABLE TO ADJUST THE ACTIVITY OF OTHER NURAL CIRCUITS THAT ARE PURELY REFLECTIVE AS WE SAY IN NUROSCIENCE THAT REALLY DUMB NURAL CIRCUITS THAT RE JUST LIKE SWITCHES AND PLACE A CONTEXT ON TO IT SO GRATITUDE IS A MINE SET THAT ACTIVATES PREFRONTAL QUARTEC AND IN DOING SO SETS THE CONTEXT OF YOUR EXPERIENCE SUCH THAT YOU CAN DERIVE TREMENDOUS HEALTH BENEFITS WHICH LEADS US TO THE QUESTION WHAT KIND OF GRATITUDE PRACTICE IS GOING TO ACCOLPLISH THIS RIGHT BECAUSE I T IS NOT SIMPLY THE CASE THAT I COULD TAKE A KNIFE DON'T PLEASE DON'T DO THIS EXPERIMENT AND CUT MY HAND AND SAY OH YOU KNOW I'M I'M GAIN ENJOY THIS I'M DOING THIS CAUSE THIS IS GOOD FOR ME AND IT WON'T HURT OF COURSE IT 'LL HURT JUST LIKE THE ICEBATH IS CALLED NO MATTER WHAT BUT I CAN'T LIE TO MYSELF RIGHT IF I IF I HAVE SOME KNOWLEDGE THAT CUTTING MYSELF IS BAD FOR ME THAT'S VERY HARD TO OVERRIDE AND SO THE MEDIAL PREFONES O QUARTEX HAS A TREMENDOUS CAPACITY IS SET CONTEXT AND IT DOES THAT BEAUTIFULLY WITH RESPECT TO GRATITUDE BUT YOU CAN'T SIMPLY LIE TO YOURSELF YOU CAN'T SIMPLY SAY OH WELL EVERY EXPERIENCE IS A LEARNING EXPERIENCE OR OM YOU KNOW A TERRIBLE THING HAPPENS OH GOOD I'M JUST GOING TO SAY GOOD AND THAT YOUR BODY WILL REACTICE IF IT'S GOOD FOR YOU THAT'S A MYTH AND FRANKLY IT'S A MYTH THAT'S FAIRLY PERVASIVE IN THE SELF HELP AND SELF ACTUALIZATION LITERATURE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REFRAME AND SET CONTEXT ON OUR EXPERIENCES BUT THAT REQUIRES A VERY SPECIFICSET OF PRACTICES WE CAN'T SIMPLY LIE TO OURSELVES ARE QUOTE AND QUOE FACED UNTIL WE MAKE ID NERL CIRCUITRY IS VERY POWERFUL AND VERY PLASTIC IT CAN BE MODIFIED AND IT'S VERY CONTEX DEPENDENT BUT IT'S NOT STUPID AND WHEN YOU LITY OURSELF ABOUT WHETHER NOT IN EXPERIENCE IS ACTUALLY GOOD FOR YOU OR NOT YOUR BRAIN KNOWS SO WHAT DOES IT AN EFFECTIVE GRATITUDE PRACTICE LOOK LIKE WELL LET'S EXAMINE WHAT AND INEFFECTIVE WHAT A POOR GRATITUDE PRACTICE LOOKS LIKE BECAUSE THEREIN LI SOME REALLY IMPORTANT INFORMATION INCLUDING THE FACT THAT I AND I THINK MILLIONS OF OTHER PEOPLE OUT THERE ARE DOING IT WRONG MOST GRATITUDE PRACTICE IS THAT YOU SEE ON LINE AND THAT PEOPLE TALK ABOUT IN VARIOUS TALKS AND SO FORTH IVALVE SOMETHING LIKE WRITING DOWN OR RECITING OR THINKING ABOUT FIVE OR TEN OR THREE OR TWENTY THINGS THAT YOUR ESPECIALLY GRATEFUL FOR AND THEN REALLY TRYING TO FEEL IN TO SOME OF THOSE REALLY TRYING THINK DEEPLY ABOUT THE EMOTIONS THE SENSATIONS THE PERCEPTIONS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE PARTICULAR PEOPLE PLACES AND THINGS ON YOUR LIST MOST STUDIES ACTUALLY POINT TO THE FACT THAT THAT STYLE OF GRATITUDE PRACTICE IS NOT PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE IN SHIFTING YOUR NERL CIRCUITRY YOUR NERL CHEMISTRY OR YOUR SOMMATIC CIRCUITRY THIS THE CIRCUITS IN YOUR BODY CAUSE YOU LITERALLY HAVE ORGANS AND NERL CIRCUITS THAT ARE CONNECTED THE CIRCUITS OF YOUR BRAIN AND BODY TOWARD INHANCED ACTIVATION OF PREFRUNTAL QORTEX IN HANCE ACTIVATION OF THESE PRO SOCIAL NERL NETWORKS THAT WE ARE TALKING BOUT EARLIER NOW THAT MAY COME AS A SURPRISE TO MANY OF YOU AND CERTAINLY CAME AS A SURPRISE TO ME THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT IF THERE'S A SHIFT IN SO CALLED AUTONOMIC AROUSAL JURING THESE GRATITUDE PRACTICES THESE ONE THAT I'M CALLING INEFFECTIVE THAT THEY CAN BE MADE SLIGHTLY MORE EFFEC TIVE SO WHAT ALL I MEAN BY A SHIFT IN AUTONOMIC AROUSAL WELL VERY BRIEFLY WE HAVE A ASPECT TO OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM BOTH WITHIN OUR BRAIN AND BODY THAT WE CALL THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM SOL A BIT OF A MISNOMER BECAUSE AUTONOMIC MEANS AUTOMATIC AND INFACT WE CAN CAN TAKE CONTROL OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IT HAS ONE BRANCH MEANING ONE SET OF CONNECTIONS AND CIRCUITS THAT AR ASSOCIATE WITH MAKING US MORE ALERT THE SO CALLED SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM OR ISHIOUS A SYMPATHETIC ARM OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT'S REALLY A MOUTHFUL ITS REALLY ASSOCIATE WITH ENHANCED ALERTNESS OF ANY KIND FOR EXCITEMENT OR FEAR AND HAS NOTHING O DO WITH SYMPATHY IS JUST ABOUT ENHANCED ALERTNESS AND THEN THE OTHER ARM OF THE AUTONOMC NERVOUS SYSTEM IS THE SO CALED PARISYMPATHETIC ARM OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM BUT THAT'S ALSO A MOUTHFUL SYLICIOUS SAY IT'S THE CALMING ASPECT OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM SORTS AS SOCIATED WITH DECREASED HEARTRATE DECREASED BREATHING RATE ET CETERA SO WE HAVE THESE TWO ASPECTS OR AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT IF PEOPLE ARE BROUGHT INTO A STATE OF HEIGHTENED SYMPATHETIC TON MEANING MORE ALERTNESS THEN THE INTENSITY OF THE EMOTIONS THAT THEY EXPERIENCE IN THEIR GRATITUDE PRACTICE IS ENHANCED AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THAT GRATITUDE PRACTICE CAN BE ENHANCED THIS IS SEEN NOWADAYS A SOMEWHAT COMMONLY AS HAVING PEOPLE FOR INSTANCE A SYCLIC HYPERVENTILATED BREATHING AS WE CALL IT IN MY LABORATORY A BREATHING THAT'S VERY INTENSE OF THE INHALE EXAILE INHALE EXILE VERY DEEPLY FOR TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY BREAST THAN PEOPLE WLSIT IN HA MEDITATIVE STANCE OR THEY'LL FOCUS ON THEIR A ON THEIR NOTE PAT AND PAPER AND THEY'L THE RIGHT OUT THET THINGS THOT THEIR GRATEFUL FOR AND THEN THEYLL REALLY TRYIN FEELING TO THOSE THINGS SOR THEYLL THINK ABOUT THOSE THINGS AND IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE AS TO WHY ENHANCING AUTONOMIC AROUSAL TOWARD MORE ALERTNESS WOULD CREATE MORE ROBUST FEELINGS OR MORE ROBUST IMPACT OF THE GRATITUDE PRACTICES BECAUSE IN THAT STATE YOU ARE MORE ALERT AND THEREFORE YOU ARE ABLE TO BRING MORE DETAIL MORE RICHNESS TO THE PERCEPTION IN THE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THOSE THINGS ON YOUR LIST HAPPEN TO BE BUT AND I SHOULD SAY THAT THERE ARE A NUMEROUS OTHER APPROACHES TO THIS THAT YOU KNOW A SORT OF SELF HELP TYPED STUFF AND SELF ELKS ACTUALIZATION SEMONIRS PEOPLE WILL DO THINGS LIKE COLD BATHS OR THEY'LL DO CHANTING OR THEY'ILL HAVE ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES ALL OF WHICH ARE MAINLY GEAR TOWARDS INCREASED AUTONOMIC AROUSAL A MEN OF THEIR EVEN PRACTICES OUT THERE USING PHARMOCOLOGY TO CREATE INCREASED AUTONOMIC AROUSAL A THAN DROPIN TO GRATITUDE A ITACROSS THE BOARD THOSE INCREASE THE POTENCY OF THE GRATITUDE PRACTICE OF LISTING THINGS OUT ON PAPEROR N ONE'S MIND OR OR SAYING THEM OUT LOUD BUT SOMEWHAT SURPRISINGLY AT LEAST TO ME THAT FORM OF JUST EXPRESSING THANKS EXPRESSING GRATITUDE IS NOT THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO SHIFT THESE PRO SOCIAL CIRCUITS IN POSIVE WAYS FOR ONE'S PHYSIOLOGY AND ANATOMY AND PSYCHOLOTUDE TURNS OUT THAT THE MOST POTENT FORM OF GRATITUDE PRACTICE IS NOT A GRATITUDE PRACTICE WHERE YOU GIVE GRATITUDE OR EXPRESS GRATITUDE BUT RATHER WHERE YOU RECEIVE GRATITUDE WHERE YOU RECEIVE THANKS  THIS TO ME WAS VERY SURPRISING THERE ARE NUMBER STUDIES ABOUT THIS NOW A WONE IN PARTICULAR THAT I THINK IS INTERESTING IS CALLED PREFRONTAL ACTIVATION WHILE LISTENING TO A LETTER OF GRATITUDE READ ALOUD BY A CO WORKER FACE TO FACE A NEAR STUDY AND I ARE S EXPLAIN WHAT ALL THIS MEANS YOU NOW KNOW WHAT THE PREFRONTAL ACTIVATION PARTIES THIS IS ACTIVATION THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX THE NEARS AND I R S STUDY THAT'S JUST A TECHNICAL A TERM I IT'S IT'S A FORM OF OF IMAGING BRAIN ACTIVITY IT'S NON INVASIVE SO TA KIND OF A SKULL CAP IT LOOKS LIKE A LOOKSLIKE A HOODIE WITH MONCH OF WIRES COMING OUT OF IT BASICALLY THAT CAN MEASURED NERAL ACTIVITY WITHOUT HAVING TUDE REMOVE ANY PARTS OF THE SKULL OR PUT A PERSON INTO ONE OF THESE TOO BLIKE FAMORI MACHINES WHICH IS VERY INVASIVE IT'S ALSO A WONDERFUL TOOL BECAUSE IT ALLOWS HUMAN SUBJECTS IN THE LABORATORY TO MOVE AROUND AND TO ENGAGE WITH ONE ANOTHER SO IN THIS PARTICULAR EXPERIMENT WHAT THEY DID IS THEY HAD CO WORKERS RITE A LETTER OF GRATITUDE OF THANKS TO ANOTHER CO WORKER UNBENOTES TO THE OTHER CO WORKER AND THAN THEY SAT DOWN TOGETHER AND THEN THE IMAGE BRAIN ACTIVITY AS THIS LETTER WAS BEING READ AND AS THE LETTER WAS BEING HEARD RECEIVED AND IT SHOWED VERY ROBUST EFFECTS ON THESE PREFRONTAL NETWORKS THAT POINTED TO THE FACT THAT RECEIVING GRATITUDE IS ACTUALLY MUCH MORE POTENT IN TERMS OF THE POSITIVE SHIFTS TAT CAN CREATE THAN GIVING GRATITUDE SO THIS RAISES A COUPLE OF IMPORTANT POINTS FIRST OF ALL IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO IS PRONE TO WRITE LETTERS OF GRATITUDE M IDEALI I THINK IT'S ITS REQUISITE THAT THESE BE GENUINE LETTERS OF GRATITUDE OR SAYING THINGS THAT ARE GENUINE EXPRESSIONS OF GRATITUDE CE BY TEXTER IN PERSON OR MY PHONE YOU HAVE WITHIN YOU A VERY POTENT FORM OF SHIFTING SOMEBODY ELSE'S NEUROLOGY NOW THAT'S WONDERFUL AND AI THINK THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE LIKE THAT OUT THERE BUT FOR MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE WANT TO EXPERIENCE THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF GRATITUDE I  IT'S PROBLY NOT A THE MOST A ADVANTAGEOUS APPROACH TO DESSIT AROUND WAITING HOPING THAT SOME ONE'S GOING TO DELIVER A ALL THESE A LETTERS OR WORDS OF GRATITUDE HOW IS IT THAT YOU CAN CREATE THAT SENSE OF RECEIVING GRATITUDE FOR YOURSELF AND THEREBY DERIVE THE EFFECTS OF GRATITUDE AS OUTLINED IN THIS PARTICULAR STUDY AND THERE WE GO BACK TO THE IMPORTANT WORK OF THE GREAT ANTONIO DEMASIO WHO EXPLORED THESE NERL CORRULETES OF GRATITUDE TO DEFINE THE AREAS OF THE BRAIN THAT ARE ASSOCIATE WITH PROSOCIAL BEHAVIORS LIKE THE PREFRONTAL QUARTECS AND WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING ABOUT THE WORK THAT DEMASU AND COLLEAGUES DID IS FIRST OF ALL THEY USED FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONENCE IMAGING SO THIS A VERY HIGH RESOLUTION APPROACH TO EXPLORING WHAT AREAS OF THE BRAIN OR AC TIVE AND THE HAS VERY HIGHWHAT WE CALL TEMPORAL RESOLUTION MEANING YOU CAN SEE THINGS IN TIME A VERY FINE SCALES SO A A LOT OF A MECHANISTIC DETAIL HAT CAN EMERGE FROM THESE SORTS OF STUDIES WHAT THEY DID WAS INTERESTING RATHER THAN HAVE PEOPLE EXPRESS GRATITUDE THEY HAD THE SUBJECTS GO INTO THE SCANNER SO THEIR BRAINS ARE BEING IMAGED AND THEY WATCHED NARRATIVES STORIES ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE EXPERIENCING POSITIVE THINGS IN THEIR LIFE ITAND IN THIS CASE THIS WAS THESE A WERE POWERFUL STORIES THESE WRESTORIES ABOUT A SURVIVERS OF GENICIDE SO THAT'S WHAT THEIR THEIR WATCHING THE SUBJECTS WERE ERE SUBJECTSTHAT WERE A NOT SURVIVERS OF GENICIDE SO THEY WERE WATCHING THESE VIDIOTAPES OF PEOPLE THAT HAD SURVIVED GENICIDE AND HAD PEOPLE HELP THEM ALONG THE WAY AS PART OF THEIR STORY OF SURVIVAL EITHER PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OR OBVOU SEE THET THEY SURVIVE LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE THE VIDIOSO OR PHYSICAL SURVIVAL SO WITHIN THESE STORIES THERE WAS OF THERE WAS CONVEYANCE OF A LOT OF STRUGGLE THESE PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT IT THE HORRIBLE SITUATIONS THEY WERE IN BUT ALSO SMALL BUT HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT FEATURES OF THEIR HISTORY THAT HAD LED TO THEIR OWN FEELINGS OF GRATITUDE SO FOR INSTANCE AM YOU KNOW IT SAYS A WOMAN AT THE IMIT THIS IS LITERALLY FROM THE SCIENTIFIC PAPER A YOU KNOW SOMEBODY HAD BEEN SICK FOR WEEKS OF THE WOMEN'S DESCRIBING HOW SHE BEEN SIX SICK FOR WEEKS AND THEND ANOTHER PRISONER WHO WAS A DOCTOR FINDS AF PARTICULAR MEDICINE SOMEHOW HAT DOESN'T DESCRIBE HOW AND LITERALLY SAVES HER LIFE OR AN ALLY WHO WAS ALSO IN A STRICKEN CIRCUMSTANCE A GET GAVE THIS PERSON A PAIR OF GLASSES WHEN THEIR EYESIGHT STARTED TO FULTER A SO THESE SORTS OF STORIES NOW OF JUST HEARING THIS IN THE CONTECTS OF NOTHING BUT A SCIENTIFIC PAPER IN DISCUSSION THESE PROBABLY OAREN'T THAT IMPACTFUL WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS STUDY AND IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF US TO KNOW IS THAT THESE STORIES OF OTHER PEOPLE RECEIVING THINGS THAT WERE POWERFUL FOR THEM IN THEIR LIFE TRAJECTORY IS IMBEDDED IN STORY AND THE HUMAN BRAIN ESPECIALLY IS SO ORIENTED TOWARD STORY WE WE HAVE NOURAL CIRCUITS THAT LIKE TO LINK TOGETHER PASS PRESENT FUTURE HAVE DIFFERENT CHARACTERS A PROTAGONISTS AND ANTAGONIST FROM THE TIME WERE VERY YOUNG UNTIL THE TIME WERE VERY OLD STORY IS ONE OF THE MAJOR WAYS THAT WE ORGANIZE INFORMATION IN THE BRAIN THER THERE DOES SEEM TO BE STORY TELLING AND AND STORY LISTENING SIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN SO IT'S IMPORTANT IS NOT A SIMPLY THAT THESE PEOPLE SURVIVE GENICIDE THATS OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT A AND AND WONDERFUL BUT IT'S NOT JUST THAT THEY WERE HELPED ALONG THE WAY IT'S THAT THE DESCRIPTION OF THEIR HELP IS IMBEDDED IN A LARGER STORY SO THE HUMAN SUBJECT IS A IN THIS SCIENTIFIC STUDY IS WATCHING THESE POWERFUL STORIES AND THE NOURAL CIRCUITS ASSOCIATED WITH PROSOCIAL BEHAVIORS AND WITH GRATITUDE BECOME ROBUSTLY ACTIVE WHEND THEY START TO FEEL SOME OFFILI ATION WITH THE PERSON TELLING THE STORY THEY START TO FEEL SOME RESINENCE WE MIGHT CALL THAT EMPATHY BUT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE EMPATHY EMPATHY IS A SOMEWHAT COMPLICATED A THING TO DEFINE BECAUSE IT IT INVOLVES LITERALLY A SETTING ASIDE OF ONE'S OWN EMOTIONS AND REALLY FOCUSSING ALMOST ENTIRELY OR EXPERIENCING ALMOST ENTIRELY THE EMOTIONS OF ANOTHER IT COULD BE SYMPATHY IT COULD BE EMPATHY WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT IT THAT THE STORIES THEMSELVES WERE ABLE TO SHIFT THE PHYSIOLOGY OF THE SUBJECTS IN IN THIS STUDY AND ACTIVATE THESE WHAT WERE CALLING GRATITUDE CIRCUITRY THAT INVOLVES THE PREFRONTAL QUORTECTS SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE EARLIER STUDY THAT RECEIVING GRATITUDE IS THE MOST POWERFUL WAY TO ACTIVATE THESE CIRCUITS FOR GRATITUDE THE SUBJECTS IN THIS STUDY IN MANY WAYS ARE RECEIVING A SENSE OF GRATITUDE BUT THROUGH THE NARRATIVE OF ONE OF THESE OTHER SUBJECTS WHICH I FIND FASCINATING  I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT A GREAT GRATITUDE GRATUALLY BE SIT DOWN LISTS OUT ALL THE THINGS YOUGRATEFUL FOR THAT JUST SEEM SO LOGICAL TO ME BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT THESE NORAL CRCUITS DON'T WORK THAT WAY THAT TO REALLY ACTIVATE THESE CIRCUITS FOR GRATITUDE IN THE SARATONAN AND PROBABLY THE OXYTOSEN SYSTEM AS WELL IN ITS PREFRONTAL NETWORKS ONE HAS TO POWERFULLY ASSOCIATE WITH THE IDEA OF RECEIVING HELP O CAD THE THE SUBJECTS ARE ASSOCIATING OR EXPERIENCING EMPATHY OR SYMPATHY FOR SOMEBODY ELSE WHO RECEIVED HELP IN THE OTHER STUDY WOULD DSCRABED AF FEW MINUTES AGO THE PERSON HERING THE LATTER WAS RECEIVING GRATITUDE AND THAT WOULD AMPLIFY THE ACTIVITY OF THESE CIRCUITS AND THAT TAKES US TO A LARGER THEME OF WHAT ARE THESE PRO SOCIAL CIRCUITS AND AN IMPORTANT CONCEPT TO EMERGE FROM THIS IS ONE THAT'S MOST OFTEN ASSOCIATE WITH THE AUTISM LITERATURE FRANKLY WHICH IS THIS IDEA OF THEORY OF MIND SUJUST VERY BRIEFLY THEORY OF MIND IS THE ABILITY TO A TRIBUTE OR TO UNDERSTAND THE EXPERIENCE OF ANOTHER WITHOUT ACTUALLY EXPERIENCING THE THING THE THEIR EXPERIENCING AGAIN IT CONOSOUNDS LIKE EMPATHY BUT THIS WAS ACTUALLY A A A TERM THAT'S NOW BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN THE PSYCHOLOGY IN NERL SCIENCE THAT'S BEEN LINCTISM OF VERY ROBUST FINDINGS ASSOCIATE WITH BRAIN AREAS AND SO FORTH THAT WAS LOOKING AT ARTISTIC KIDS AND NON ARTISTIC KIDS ATHE PERSON LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING THEORY OF MIND IS SIMON BARON COEN HE I BELIEVE HE'S EITHER THE BROTHER OR THE COUSIN II CANT RECALL WHICH TO THE COMMEDIAN SACHABARON COEN SIMONMARINCONE IS A PROFESSOR AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY OR AT LEAST HE WAS THE LAST TIME I CHECT AND THE THEORY OF MIND TEST CAN BE DONE ON ADULTS OR ON CHILDREN AND WE CAN SORT OF DO THAT EXPERIMENT RIGHT NOW IF YOU LIKE AND YOU CAN THING ABOUT HOW YOU WOULD BEHAVE IF YOU WERE A SUBJECT IN O A THEORY OF MIND TEST THEORY MIND TEST INVOLVES YOU OR A CHILD OR SOME OTHER ADULT SITTING DOWN AND WATCHING A VIDIO OF A CHILD GOING INTO A ROOM OR A PERSON GOING TO ROOM OPENING UP A DESK OF A A DRESSER A DRAWER FOR INSTANCE OR A DEST DRAWER AND PLACING SOMETHING IN IT LIKE APEN OR A TOY AND THEN LEAVING AND THEN ANOTHER PERSON WALKING INTO THE ROOM AND CLEARLY LOOKING FOR SOMETHING IN THE ROOM AND ONE PRESUMES ITS THE TOY OR THE PEN DEPENDING ON THE CONTEXT PEOPLE WHO HAVE STRONG THEORY OF MIND MAKE THE OBVIOUS CONCLUSION THAT THE PERSON LOOKING AROUND FOR THE PEN OR THE OR THE TOY IS CONFUSED OR THEY OM THEIRE PERPLEX THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE THE TOY IS THEI'RE LOOKING FOR THE TOY SOME ONE WHO IS A FEIRLY FAR U TO ONE SIDE OF THE AUTISM OR ASBERGERS SPECTRUM WILL SIMPLY FOCUS ON THE LOCATION OF THE OBJECT ON THE LOCATION OF THE THE PEN OR THE TOY AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IN CHILDREN THEY WILL SAY WELL IT'S IN THE SECOND DRAWER ITS IN THE SECOND DRAWN THEYLL SAY WELL HOW DOES A THE PERSON COMES INTO THE ROOM FIELD THEY'LL SAY WELL ITS IN THE DRAWER SO THEY TEND TO FOCUS ON THE SPECIFIC FACTUAL ELEMENTS OF THE CENARIO RATHER THAN PLACE THEIR MIND INTO THE MIND OF THE OTHER PERSON SO CALLED THEORY OF MIND NOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT PEOPLE WITH AUTISM AND ASPERGERS DON'T HAVE EMPATHY AN SOME CASES THEY CAN IT SORT DEPENDS ON WHERE THEY ARE IN THE SPECTRUM AND SO FORTH BUT THEORY OF MIND HAS VERY STRONG BASIS IN THESE PREFRONTAL QUARTECS NARAL CIRCUITS THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE AS YOU NOW KNOW THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEXT SETS ONTEXT ON WHAT WE SEE AN EXPERIENCE AND THE THEORY OF MIND TASK THAT JUST DESCRIBED A VERY BRIEFLY IS A PURY EXAMPLE OF CONTEXT SETTING RIGHT IT'S NOT ABOUT THE FACT JUST THE FACTUAL ELEMENTS ABOUT THE LOCATION OF THE OBJECTS IT'S ABOUT THE CONTEXTS SOME ONE IS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT SOME ONE ELSE PUT SOME PLACE THAT MAKES IT SUCH THAT THAT OBJECT IS HIDDEN SO THASTILY THEORY OF MIND IS YOURABILITY O PUT YOURSELF INTO THE MIND SAID OF ANOTHER AND IN ORDER TO GET ACTIVATION OF THESE GRATITUDE CIRCUITS ONE NEEDS TO PUT THEMSELVES INTO THE MIND SET OF ANOTHER OR TO DIRECTLY RECEIVE GRATITUDE SOLICTIOUS TAKE A MOMENT AND START TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE ARE GOING TO BUILD OUT THE ULTIMATE GRATITUDE PRACTICE MEAN THE MOST EFFECTIVE GRATITUDE PRACTICE FOR US TO DO BECAUSE OF ALL THE MANY PAUSIVE EFFECTS THAT AN EFFECTIVE GRATITUDE PRACTICE CAN HAVE IF IT'S THE PROPER ONE IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT RECEIVING GRATITUDE IS POWERFUL BUT IT'S ALSO VERY CLEAR THAT WAITING AROUND TO RECEIVE THAT GRATITUDE IS AN IMPRACTICAL APPROACH NOW THERE ARE METHODS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED BY MY COLLIGITS TEMPHERED TLLING MAGONICAL AND OTHERS THAT ACTUALLY HAVE DEVELOPED THINGS FOR THE WORK PLACE FOR SCHOOL FOR CO WORKERS AND STUDENTS TO RIHT OUT OF PARTICULAR WORK SHEETS RELATED TO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE THANKFUL FOR FROM OTHERS AND EXCHANGE THEM AND SO THOSE ARE VERY USEFUL PRACTICES I DON'T WANTAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT KELLING N OTHERS HAVE DONE BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF HAVING OTHER PEOPLE TO DO THESE PRACTICES WITH BT WE KNOW FOR SURE IS THAT THERE HAS TO BE A REAL EXPERIENCE OF S MEBODY ELSE'S EXPERIENCE AND THAT THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS STORY SO IN THINKING ABOUT HOW TO BUILD OUT AN EFFECTIVE GRATITUDE PRACTICE IT'S VERY WORTH WHILE I BELIEVE TO FIND SOMEONE'S NARRATIVE THAT'S POWERFUL FOR YOU IN MANY WAYS THE THING ABOUT THIS IS IT'S GOT TO BE A STORY THAT INSPIRES YOU BECAUSE OF THE FOR LACK OF A BETTER PHRASE THE BEAUTY OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT OR THE ABILITY OF HUMANS TO HELP OTHER HUMANS AND I FIND THIS REMARKABLE BECAUSE WHAT THIS REALLY MEANS IS THAT THE CIRCUITS FOR GRATITUDE OR SUCH THAT WE CAN EXCHANGE GRATITUDE WE CAN ACTUALLY OBSERVE SOME ONE ELSE GETTING HELP SOME ONE ELSE GIVING HELP AND THAT OBSERVATION OF OUR SPECIES DOING THAT FOR ONE ANOTHER ALLOWS US TO EXPERIENCE THE FEELING OF A GENUINE CHEMICAL AND NORAL CIRCUIT ACTIVATION LIFT IF YOU WILL VERY VERY DIFFERENT THEN SIMPLY WRITING OUT THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE THANKFUL FOR RIGHT AND SO HOW WOULD YOU DO THIS WELL PEOPLE DIGEST STORY IN IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS PEOPLE WATCH MOVIES PEOPLE I LISSEN UPOD CAST PEOPLE READ BOOKS THERE TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF STORIES OUT THERE IT'S CLEAR THAT AN EFFECTIVE GRATITUDE PRACTICE HAS TO BE REPEATED FROM TIME TO TIME SO WHAT I WOULD NOT SUGGEST IS THAT WE BUILD A PROTOCOL IN WHICH YOUARE CONSTANTLY FORAGING FOR INSPIRATIONAL STORIES OVER AND OVER AGAIN YOU KNOW SOCIA MEDIA AND THE INTERNATOR REPLETE WITH THOSE THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE A VERY POTENT PROTOCOLOR TOOL BECAUSE THE MOST POTENT PROTOCOLOR TOOL FOR GRATITUDE IS GOING TO BE ONE THAT YOU REPEAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN RATHER THE MOST EFFECTIVE PROTOCOLR TOOL IS GOING TO BE EITHER TO THINK INTO WHEN YOU COULD WRITE THIS OUT IF YOU LIKE BUT THINK INTO WHEN SOMEBODY WAS THANKFUL FOR SOMETHING THAT YOU DID AND REALLY START TO THINK ABOUT HOW YOU FELT IN RECEIVING THAT GRATITUDE OR AND OR I SHOULD SAY IMAGINING OR THINKING ABOUT DEEPLY THE MOTIONAL EXPERIENCE OF SOMEBODY ELSE RECEIVING HELP NOW WHAT NARRATIVE YOU SELECT IS GOING TO BE VERY DEPENDENT ON YOU AND YOUR TASTE IT'S GOING TO BE VERY DEPENDENT ON WHAT RESONATES WITH YOU BUT AGAIN I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE STORY THAT YOU SELECT DOES NOT HAVE TO HAVE ANY SEMBLANCE TO YOUR OWN LIFE EXPERIENCE IT'S JUST ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO MOVE YOU AND SO THE WAY THAT ONE COULD DO THIS AND ACTUALLY HAVE STARTED THIS PRACTICE FOR MYSELF ON THE BASIS OF THE LEARNINGS I'VE HAD IN IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS AROUND PREPARING FOR THIS EPISODE IS TO FIND THE STORY THAT'S PARTICULARLY MEANINGFUL FOR YOU AND THEN TO JUST TAKE SOME SHORT NOTES BULLET POINT NOTES A ABOUT MAY BE LIST OUT FOR INSTANCE ON A JUST A SMALL SHET OF PAPER IM OR IN YOUR PHONE IF IF THAT'S YOUR PREFERENCE A JUST LIST OUT FOR INSTANCE YOU KNOW WHAT THE STRUGGLE WAS WHAT THE HELP WA S AND SOMETHING ABOUT HOW THAT IMPACTS YOU EMOTIONALLY  THIS IS SOMETHING JUST FOR YOU YOU WANT TO SHARE IT WITH ANYBODY THAT KIND OF SHORT HAND LIST OF BULLET POINT NOTES SERVES AS YOUR SHORT HAND FOR GETTING INTO THIS MODE THAT WE'RE CALL IN GRATITUDE AND ACTUALLY CLOSELY MIMICS A LOT OF WHAT WAS DONE IN THESE VARIOUS STUDIES BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THE STUDIES TITHAVE TALKED ABOUT UP UNTIL NOW REALLY FOCUSSED ON WHAT WE CALL ACUTE IMAGING STUDIES WHERE SOME ONE WATCH TO STORY OR RECEIVE GRATITUDE WHILE THE EXPERIMENT WAS DONE AND THEN THAT'S IT ONE AND DONE THERE ARE OTHER STUDIES LOOKING I GRATITUDE IN THIS CONTEXT OVER MANY WEEKS UP TO SIX WEEKS AND WHAT ONE OBSERVES IS THAT THERE'S SO CALE NEURAL PLASTICITY OF THESE CIRCUITS YOUR PLASTICITY IS THE BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEMS ABILITY TO CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO EXPERIENCE AND THAT THESE NEURL CIRCUITS START DEVELOPING A FAMILIARITY WITH THE NARRATIVE SO THAT FOR INSTANCE LET SAY YOU SIT DOWN THE FIRST TIME YOU YOUE FOUND A STORY THAT YOU FIND PARTICULARLY COMPELLING YOU'VE WRITTEN DOWN A A FEW NOTES ABOUT WHAT THAT STORY IS JUST TO REMIND YOU AM AND THEN YOU READ THOSE OUT AND YOU THINK INTO THE RICHNESS OF THAT EXPERIENCE THAT RECEIVING OF GRATITUDE OR IF YOU PREFER YOU'RE DOING THE PROTOCOL WHERE YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT WHEN SOMEONE WAS DEEPLY GRATEFUL OR WAS GRAT GENUINELY GRATEFUL TO YOU THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT THAT THE NERAL CIRCUITS BECOME ACTIVATED MORE EASILY WITH EACH SUBSEQUENT REPEAT OF THE PRACTICE NOW THIS CAN BE DONE LITERALLY FOR ONE MINUTE OR TWO MINUTES OR THREE MINUTES THIS IS NOT AN EXTENSIVELY LONG PRACTICE AND THAT S ANOTHER BEAUTY OF GRATITUDE PRACTICES IS THAT THEY HAVE THE OUTSIZE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON SO MANY ASPECTS OF OUR PHYSIOLOGY BUT THESE ARE VERY SHORT PRACTICES THERE THE KIND OF THING THAT YOU CAN DO WALKING TO YOUR CAR THE KIND OF THING Y YOU DOSIT DOWN FOR A MINUTE AND SET OF TIMER AN AND DOU BECAUSE THEY ARE REALLY ABOUT CHANGING YOUR STATE OF MIND AND BODY AND IF YOU HAVE AN EXPERIENCE OF RECEIVING GRATITUDE OR A STORY THAT'S VERY POTENT FOR YOU IT BECOMES A SORT OF SHORT CUT INTO THE GRATITUDE NETWORK THESE PROSOCIAL NETWORKS MEANING THE ACTIVATION OF THESE CIRCUITS BECOMES ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSE AND THAT S VERY DIFFERENT THAN A LOT OF OTHER PRACTICES OUT THERE YOU IAM NOT AWARE OF ANY MEDITATION PRACTICES FOR INSTANCE THAT YOU CAN DO ONLY A FEW TIMES A AND THEN WITHIN AYOU KNOW A WEEK OR SO YOU JUST HAVE TO DO THEM FOR ONE MINUTE YOU IMMEDIATELY DROP INTO THE KIND OF OPTIMOL STATE THAT THAT MEDITATION PRACTICEIS DESIGN TO CREATE THERE ARE SOME SHORT OF MEDITATION PRACTICES THAT ARE VERY POTENT N VERY EFFECTIVE LIKE THAT BUT GRATITUDE AND THE CIRCUITS ASSOCIATE WITH IT APPEAR TO BE ESPECIALLY PLASTIC MEANING ESPECIALLY PRONE TO AM A BEING ABLE TO BE TRIGGERED IN THE GOOD SENSE OF THE WORD TRIGGERD JUST BY SIMPLY REMINDING YOURSELF OF THIS PARTICULAR NARRATIVE NOW THERE'S ANOTHER VERY CLEAR AND POSITIVE EFFACTIVE USING THIS NARRATIVE OR STORY BASED APPROACH TO A GRATITUDE PRACTICE AND THAT'S WHAT STORY DOES FOR OUR PHYSIOLOGY EARLIER IN THE EPISODE I MENTION THIS REALLY INCREDIBLE STUDY IN WHICH LISTENING TO A STORY CORDINATED THE HEART RATES OF DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS AND CHANT LITERALLY CHANGED THE WAY THAT THEIR HEART WAS BEATING THE TITLE OF THE STUDY IS CONSCIOUS PROCESSING OF NARRATIVE STIMULLE SYNCHRONIZES HEART RATE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS THE FIRST AUTHORIS OF PARIS ON AGAIN PUBLISH AN SELF REPORT SELFRASTERNAL EXCELLENT JOURNAL AND IT'S A REALLY ELEGANT STUDY THEY LOOKED AT INSTANTANEOUS HEART RATE THEY USE ELECTRICARDIOGRAM TO DO THAT WHICH IS SIMPLY AWAY TO LOOK AT HEART BEATS WITH VERY FINE PRECISION THEY ALSO LOOKED AT THE BREATHING OF SUBJECTS AS THEY LISTEN TO THESE STORIES SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW THAT BREATHING AT HEART RATE ARE ACTUALLY LINK TO ONE ANOTHER IN A REALLY INTERESTING WAY THE SIMPLE WAY TO PUT IT IS THAT WHEN YOU INHALE YOUR HEART RATE SPEEDS UP A LITTLE BIT AND WHEN YOU EXHALE YOUR HEART RATES SLOWS DOWN AND THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE MOVEMENT OF THE DIAPHRAM IN A IN YOUR THORACIC CAVITY AND ON THE PHYSICIANS AND MEDICAL TYPES CALL THIS RESPIRATORY SCINESTS A RHYTHMEA AH THERE'S A MECHANISM THERE WE COULD GET INTO BUT I DON'T WANT TO DISTRACT US FROM THE MAIN THEME HERE SO JUST REMEMBER WHEN YOU INHALE YOUR EART RATE SPEADS UP AND WHEN YOU EXHAL YOUR HEARTRATES SLOWS DOWN THEY LOOKED AT BREATHING THEY LOOKED AT HEART RATE IN DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS AND LISTENING TO A STORY PRODUCED VERY CONSISTENT GAPS BETWEEN THE HEART RATES OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LISTENING DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS IN THE STUDY WHO ERE NOT LOCATED IN THE SAME PLACE WHEN THEY LISTEN TO THE STORY LISTENING THE STORY IN DIFFERENT TIMES DIFFERENT DAYS ENTIRELY HAD VERY SIMILAR HEART BEAT PATTERNS LISTENING TO THE STORY WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOUR GRATITUDE PRACTICE IS THAT HAVING A STORY THAT YOU RETURN TO OVER AND OVER AGAIN EVEN OF ITS NOT THE ENTIRE STORY YORE DIST USING THE SHORTHAND BULLET POINT A VERSION OF YOUR STORY WILL CREATE A PERCEPTIBLE AND REAL SHIFT IN YOUR HEART BEAT AND IN YOUR BREATHING AND ACTUALLY THAT'S BEEN DEMONSTRATED OVER AND OVER NOW THAT AN EFFECTIVE GRATITUDE PRACTICE IS ONE THAT CAN RAPIDLY SHIFT NOT JUST THE ACTIVATION OF THESE CIRCUITS IN YOUR BRAIN FOR PROSOCIAL BEHAVIORS BUT ALSO ACTIVATION OF PARTICULAR CIRCUITS IN YOUR HEART AND IN YOUR LUNGS AND THE OTHER ORGANS OF YOUR BODY SUCH THAT YOU CAN GET INTO A REPRODUCIBLE STATE OF GRATITUDE EACH TIME SO AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT HERE IS THAT THERE BE SOME ELEMENT OF STORY AGAIN YOU DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO OR READ OR THINK ABOUT THE ENTIRE STORY START TO FINISH IN ORDER TO EXTRACT THESE BENEFITS AND THAT IT BE THE SAME STORY OVER AND OVER AND AS A CONSEQUENCE THAT'S GOING TO SHIFT YOUR PHYSIOLOGY INTO PRESUMABLY A MORE RELAXED STATE BECAUSE TYPICALLY THAT'S THE ONE THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH GRATITUDE ALTHOUGH ACTIVATION OF THESE GRATITUDE CIRCUITS HAS ALSO BEEN SHOWN TO CREATE SENSE OF AWE OR SENSE OF JOY THEIRE FEW STUDIES LOOKING AT O AND KIND OF PARSING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GRATITUDE AND JOY I WAS ABLE TO FIND IF YOU STUDIES ABOUT THAT BUT IN GENERAL THEY TEND THE NORAL CIRCUITS THAT ARE ACTIVATED TEND TO OVERLAP QUITE A LOT T WITH THOSE A THAT ACT THAT CREATE A SENSE OF GRATITUDE SO WE DO'T WANT A SPLIT HAIRS UNNECESSARILY THERE THE KEY THING IS THAT YOU WANT TO USE THE SAME STORY EVEN IF IT' IF IT'S YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE OR SOMEBODY ELSE'S AND KEEP COMING BACK TO IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT MAKES IT A VERY POTENT TOOL THAT YOU CAN GET A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF BENEFIT FROM WITH EVEN AS SHORT AS SIXTY SECONDS OF PRACTICE EARLIER I TALKED ABOUT HOW YOU CAN'T LIE TO YOURSELF AND SAY YOU KNOW IAM SO GRATEFUL FOR THIS THING THAT I ACTUALLY HATE AND IN AMOMENT OMENT TELL YOU ABOUT SOME SCIENTIFIC DATA THAT PROVES THE STATEMENT I MADE IS TRUE AND THAT YOU CAN'T JUST LIE TO YOURSELF AND DERIVED THE BENEFITS OF A GRATITUDE PRACTICE THE DATARE ALSO GIN A POINT TO THE FACT THAT IF YOU ARE GIVING GRATITUDE NOT JUST RECEIVING IT BUT GIVING GRATITUDE THAT TOO HAS TO BE GENUINE THERE'S A REALLY INTERESTING STUDIES PUBLISHED IN SCIENTIFIC REPORTS WHICH IS A NATURE RESEARCH JOURNAL THE TITLE OF IT IS NERAL RESPONSES TO INTENTION AND BENEFIT A PRASAL OR CRITICAL IN DISTINGUISHING GRATITUDE ENJOY IT'S A SOMEWHAT COMPLICATED STUDY SO IM JUST GON A HIT ON SOME OF THE HIGH POINTS BUT BASILY WHAT THEY DID IS THEY USE FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESIDENCE IMAGING SO THEY COULD LOOK AT BRAIN CIRCUITARY ACTIVATION WITH VERY HIGH PRECISION AND THEY HAD PEOPLE RECEIVING MONEY IN THIS IN THE CONTECTS OF THIS A EXPERIMENT AND THEY HAD SOME KNOWLEDGE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THE MONEY THAT THEY WERE RECEIVING WAS GIVEN TO THEM WHOLE HEARTEDLY OR RELUCTANTLY AND THERE WERE NUMBER DIFFERENT VARIABLES IN THE STUDY INCLUDING HOW MUCH MONEY WAS GIVEN SO IN SOME CASES IT WAS VERY LITTLE IN OTHER CASES IT WAS MODEST ANDOTHER CASES IT WAS A LOT MORE AND THEY ALSO VARIED THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE GIVER OF THE MONEY THAT CALLED THE BENEFACTOR WAS DOING IT WHOLE HEARDEDLY OR SEEM TO BE DOING IT SOMEWHAT RELUCTANTLY AND THEY LOOKED AT WHETHER OR NOT THE SENSE OF GRATITUDE SCALED WITH THE AMOUNT OF MONEY RECEIVED AND OR THE INTENTION OF THE BENEFACTOR WHETHEROR NOT THE PERSON GIVING THE MONEY WAS DOING IT WHOLEHEARTEDLY OR RELUCTANTLY AND WHAT'S REMARKABLE IS THAT WHILE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY GIVEN WAS A STRONG COMPONENT IN WHETHER OR NOT SOMEBODY FELT GRAT THAT THEY HAD RECEIVED GRATITUDE WHICH MAKE SENSE YOU KNOW THAT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY IS IS SOME SOME METRIC OF WHETHER OR NOT A SOMEBODY FEELS A THANKED THE STRONGER VARIABLE THE BIGGER IN PACT CAME FROM WHETHER R NOT THE PERSON GIVING THE MONEY WAS GIVING IT WITH A WHOLEHEARTED INTENTION AND NOT A RELUCTANT INTENTION AND OF COURSE THERE WAS AN INTERACTION WHERE THE BEST CIRCUMSTANCE OF COURSE IS WHERE THE PERSON RECEIVED A LOT OF MONEY FROM SOMEBODY WHO WHOLEHEARTEDLY WANTED TO GIVE THEM A LOT OF MONEY AND THEY DID EVERY DERIVATION OF THIS BUT THIS IS OF IMPORTANT THIS TELLS US O MANY THINGS THET EXTEND WAY BEYOND GRATITUDE PRACTICES WHICH IS THAT GENUINE THANKS AR WHAT COUNT WE COULD PROB LY PRESUME THAT BUT RECEVING GENUINE THANKS IS ALSO A STRONG VARIABLE IN DETERMINING WEATHER NOT WE EXPERIENCE REAL GRATITUDE OR WHETHER OR NOT ITS EMPTY REGARDLESS OF THE SIZE OF A GIFT SO THIS CONSTRAINS OUR GRATITUDE PRACTICE IS SOMEWHAT BUT I THINK IN AN INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT WAY YOU CAN'T MAKE THE STUFF UP YOU CAN'T TELL YOURSELF THAT IN EXPERIENCE WAS GRAT OR THAT AM YOU KNOW I GOT A LOT OF MONEY AND THEREFORE IT IT JUSTIFIED IT AH EVEN KTNOW YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THEY GIVE IT TO ME RELUCTANTLY OR MY BOSS HATES ME BUT THEY GAIY ME YOUR RAYS AM THAT STUFF STINGS O FOR ALL THE RIGHT REASONS BECAUSE THERE ARE CIRCUITS IN OUR BRAIN AND BODY THET ARE ORIENTED TOWARDS THESE PROSOCIAL INTERACTIONS AND IN SOME SENSE WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR AS A SPECIES WHAT THESE CIRCUITS WANT IF YOU WILL IS TO RECEIVE THINGS FROM PEOPLE THAT ARE GIVING THEM WHOLEHEARTEDLY AND THAT TELLS US THAT IF IF WE ARE THE GIVER THAT WE BETTER BE GIVING WHOLE HEARTEDLY OR WE ARE UNDERMINING THE SENSE OF GRATITUDE THAT SOME ONE IS GOING TO RECEIVE FROM US SO WE ARE GRADUALLY BUILDING UP THE ULTIMATE GRATITUDE PRACTICE BASED ON THE VARIETY OF SCIENTIFIC LITRITURE THAT'S OUT THERE AND I KNOW THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE PROBABLY INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING A GRATITUDE PRACTICE THAT HAS LONG LASTING MAY BE EVEN PERMANENT POSITIVE EFFECTS ON THEIR NORL CIRCUITRY SO WITH THAT AM IN I WANT A TURN OUR ATTENTION TO A REALLY INTERESTING STUDY ITS ENTITLED EFFECTS OF GRATITUDE MEDITATION ON NORAL NETWORK FUNCTIONAL CONUCTIVITY AND BRAIN HEART COUPLING AND TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT AND A LOT SIMPLER THAN THAT TITLE REPEATED GRATITUDE PRACTICE CHANGES THE WAY THAT YOUR RAIN CIRCUITS WORK AND IT ALSO CHANGES THE WAY IN WHICH YOUR HEART AND YOUR BRAIN INTERACT YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE FACT T YOUR BRAIN CONTROLS YOUR HEART BECAUSEYUYOUL BE STRESSED ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S PERCEIVED WITH YOUR BRAIN AND THEN YOUR HEART RATE WILL SPEED UP YOUE PROBABLY ALSO FAMILIAR WITH THE FACT THAT IF YOUR HEARTRATES SPEEDS UP FOR SOME REASON OR NO REASON YOUR POBLICTHING WHT WHAT'S MAKING MOU HEARTRATES PEET UP BENHAT'S BECAUSE THEY THE BRAIN IN THE HEART ARE RECIPROCALLY IN INTERVATED AS WE SAY THEIR TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER IN BOTH DIRECTIONS IS A TWO WEIGH HIGHWAY THIS STUDY LOOKED AT CHANGES IN SO CALLED FUNCTIONAL CONUCTIVITY WITHIN THE BRAIN AND BETWEEN THE BRAIN IN THE HEART IN RESPONSE TO GRATITUDE PRACTICES AND AS A CONTROL THEY USED WHAT I THING IS VERY INTERESTING OF RESENTMENT INTERVENTION AH I THING RESENTMENT IS I IS A IN APT CONTROL AH IN QUITE DIFFERENT THAN GRATITUDE TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT A REPEATED GRATITUDE PRACTICE COULD CHANGE THE RESTING STATE FUNCTIONAL CONACTIVITY IN EMOTION AND MOTIVATION RELATED BRAIN REGIONS IF I HAVEN'T MENTIONED A STRONG ENOUGH INCENTIVE FOR DOING A REGULAR GRATITUDE PRACTICE UNTIL NOW THIS IS DEAFLING TE ONE TO PAY ATTENTION TUDE BECAUSE WHAT THEY FOUND WAS A REGULAR GRATITUDE PRACTICE COULD SHIFT THE FUNCTIONAL CONACTIVITY OF MOTION PATHWAYS IN WAYS THAT MADE ANXIETY AND FEAR CIRCITS LESS LIKELY TO BE ACTIVE AND CIRCUITS FOR FEELINGS OF WELL BEING BUT ALSO MOTIVATION TO BE MUCH MORE ACTIVE I FIND THAT REMARKABLE AND IMPORTANT BECAUSE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE STRUGGLE WITH ISSUES OF MOTIVATION A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE HIGHLY MOTIVATED ALSO HAVE ISSUES WITH ANXIETY AND FEAR AND SO THIS STUDY REALLY POINTS TO THE FACT THAT IT'S A TWO FUR IF YOU HAVE A GOOD GRATITUDE PRACTICE AND YOU REPEAT IT REGULARLY YOU REDUCE THE FEAR ANXIETY CIRCUITS YOU INCREASE THE EFFICACY OF THE POSITIVE EMOTION FEEL GOOD CIRCUITS AND THE CIRCUITS ASSOCIATE WITH MOTIVATION AND PURSUDES ARE ACTUALLY ENHANCED AS WELL THAT'S VERY STRONG INCENTIVE TO A IN HAVE A GRATITUDE PRACTICE IN ONE THAT YUSE REGULARLY WI'LL TALK ABOUT HOW REGULARLY IN IN JUST A MOMENT I DO'T WNT TO GO INTO TOO MANY DETAILS TO THIS STUDY ALTHOUGH WE WILL PUT A REFERENCE TO IT IF YOU LIKE IT INCLUDES A A LOT OF EPHIMORI DATA IMAGING DATA OF DIFFERENT BRAIN AIR IS MANY MANY TABLES AND EXAMPLES OF MATURE SEAS OF BEFORE AND AFTER GRATITUDE AFTER RESENTMENT A ET CETERA YOU DO INDEED HAVE CIRCUITS IN YOUR BRAIN FOR RESENTMENT WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT UM WE ALL DO AND A SOME  PEOPLE JOSTHEYS CIRCUITS ARE MORE ROBUST THAN OTHERS BUT THE REMARKABLE THING IS ONE CAN SHIFT THESE CIRCUITS IN THE DIRECTION THAT I THINK MOST PEOPLE LIKE WHICH IS MORE SENSE OF WELL BEING IN MOTIVATION UNLESS A RESENTMENT AND FEAR LITERALLY AND WHAT'S REALLY COOL ABOUT THIS STUDY ALSO IS THAT THE INTERVENTIONS ARE ONLY FIVE MINUTES LONG IT'S INCREDIBLE FIVE MINUTES LONG AND SO AS WE START TO BUILD OUT ARE IDEAL GRATITUDE PRACTICE WE KNOW THAT IT HAS TO HAVE CERTAIN FEATURES FIRST OF ALL IT HAS TO BE GROUNDED IN A STORY PROBABLY A STORY THAT YOU'VE HEARD IN ITS ENTIRELY AT LEAST ONCE BUT THEN YOU CAN HAVE A SHORT HAND AVERSION THE SOCAL BULLET POINTS THAT I TALKED ABOUT BEFORE THEY LIKE TO DROP INTO THAT STORY A WERE THE EMOTIONAL ASSOCIATIONS WITH THAT STORIES YOU NOT TO LISTEN THE WHOLE STORY EACH TIME THAT STORY SHOULD BE ONE IN WHICH YOU ARE GENUINELY BEING THANKED FOR SOMETHING AND IT MADE YOU FEEL GOOD OR IT COULD BE A STORY ABOUT SOME ONE ELSE GENUINELY EXPRESSING THANKS CA BASED ON DESEA DESCRIPTION OF THE GRATITUDE PRACTICES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER YOUR GRATITUDE PRACTICE CAN BE VERY BRIEF MAK CAN BE AS BRIEF AS ONE MINUTE SIXTY SECONDS OR FIVE MINUTES WHICH STILL SEEMS VERY BRIEF TO ME ALTHOUGH IN THE STUDIES THEY WERE GETTING THESE REALLY MAJOUR EFFECTS JUST FROM FIVE MINUTES OF GRATITUDE PRACTICE SOME OF THESE PAPERS INVOLVE PEOPLE DOING SOME FOCUSSING ON THEIR BREATHING AND CALMING THEMSELVES AS THEY GO INTO THE GRATITUDE PRACTICE BUT THAT'S WITHIN THE FIVE MINUTE BLOCK SO IF YOU DECIDE THAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO A GA GRATITUDE PRACTICE THAT INVOLVES FIRST AM YOU KNOW I ON DOING SOME CALMING BREATHING EXCALE EMPHASIZED BREATHING FOR INSTANCE ARE PHYSIOLOGICAL SIZE THINGS HAVE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE ON THIS PODCASTIC CAN HLP CALMME DOWN CIS THEY ABE LOT OF EXALES WHICH YOU KNOW NOW SLOWS YOUR HEARTRAGHT DOWN AND THEN DOING YOUR GRATITUDE PRACTICE THAT'S FINE IT'S ACTUALLY NOT NECESSARY BUT A LOT OF THESE A STUDIES USED THAT I THINK ONCE A NARRATIVE HAS BEEN SET YOU'VEHEARD THE STORY AND HAS MEANING FOR YOU OR YOU HAVE A RECOLLECTION OF A STORY WHERE YOU ARE GENUINELY THANK THEN I THINK JUST SIXTY SECONDS OR MAY BE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SECONDS SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT THEN THE QUESTION BECOMES HOW OFTEN TO REPEAT THIS GRATITUDE PRACTICE THATS NOT EXACTLY CLEAR FROM THE EXISTING LITERATURE I CAN'T POINT ANY ONE STUDY AYS FIVE TIMES A WEEK OR FORTIMES A WEEK SO I MEUN TO THROW OUT A NUMBER A WHICH IS THREE TIMES A WEEK AND THEN PEOPLE WILL ASK WHAT WHEN SHOULD I DO THAT GRATITUDE PRACTICE AND I'LL TELL YOU A WHAT I TELL MOST EVERYBODY ABOUT MOST EVERY PRACTICE WITH E FEW EXCEPTIONS WHICH IS THE BEST TIME OF DAY TO DO THIS PRACTICE IS WHEN YOU FIRST WAKE UP IN THE MORNING OR BEFORE YOU GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT OR ANY TIME OF DAY SO WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE NARRAL CIRCUITRY CHANGES ASSOCIATED WITH A REGULAR GRATITUDE PRACTICE AND I SHOULD MENTION THAT THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL NARRW CIRCUITORY SHIFT THAT OCCURS IT RELATES TO A STRUCTURE THAT I MENTION JUST BRIEFLY EARLIER WHICH IS THE SO CALLED A C C OR ANTERIOR SINGULATE QUARTEX THIS IS A NARRATIF THE BRAIN THAT HAS SEVERAL FUNCTIONS BUT MORE AND MORE DATAR POINTING TO THE FACT THAT THE A C C IS ACTHLLY INVOLVED IN EMPATHY AND IS INVOLVED IN UNDERSTANDING THE EMOTIONAL STATES OF OTHERS IN GENERAL EVEN IF IT DOESN'T INVOKE A SENSE OF EMPATHY AND THERE ARE SEVERAL STUDIES THAT POINT TO THE FACT THAT IN HUMANS WHO HAVE A REGULAR GRATITUDE PRACTICE THE A C C BECOMES MORE ROBUSTLY ENGAGED I EVEN WITH THESE VERY BRIEF GRATITUDE PRACTICES WE ACTUALLY HAVE A PROJECT IN OUR LAB A THIS IS ACTUALLY DONE IN ANIMAL MODELS WITH A WHERE ANIMALS OBSERVE OTHER ANIMALS EXPERIENCING A CERTAIN EMOTIONAL STATES AND ONE OF THE BRAIN AIRIAS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED AS IMPORTANT FOR THIS SKIND OF A PRIMORDIAL FORM OF EMPATHY CAUSE WE REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THESE A MICE OR THINKING A WE WE WORK ON HUMANS IN THE CASE WHERE WE WORK ON HUMANS OF COURSE WE ASK THEM AN THEY TELL US O WHAT THEY THINK THEIRE THINKING A WITH THE MICE WE WE ASK THEM BUT THEY DON'T TELL US MUCH OF ANYTHING INTERESTING INSTEAD WE WE MEASURE NUMBER PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGNALS BUT THE IMPORTANT POINT IS THAT THE THE A C C THE INTERA SINGULATE QUARTECS SEEMS TO BE AN IMPORTANT HUB FOR THE GENERATION AND EXECUTION OF EMPATHY AT AS IT RELATES TO FELINGS AND EMPATHIC BEHAVIORS ULTURISTIC BEHAVIORS OF OF ANIMALS HELPING ANIMALS AND HUMANS A HELPING OTHER HUMANS WE SEE THIS IN ANIMAL MODELS WE SEE THIS IN HUMANS SO IF YOU WANT TO BE A MORE IMPATHIC PERSON OR GRATITUDE PRACTICE IS ALSO GOING TO BE A VERY A EFFECTIVE FOR THAT IT APPEARS ESPECIUALLY USING THIS NARRATIVE TYPE APPROACH WHERE YOU ARE USING SOME ONE ELSE'S NARRATIVE OF RECEIVING GRATITUDE A AS A WAY TO TAPPIN TO YOUR OWN SENSE OF GRATITUDE THUS FAR WE'VE MAINLY TALKED ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF GRATITUDE ON NORAL CIRCUIT ACTIVATION IN CHANGES A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT ARE HAPPENING IN TERMS OF THE BODY HEART RATED AND BREATHING AND SO FORTH BUT WE HAVEN'T TALKED A LOT YET ABOUT THE CHANGES IN HEALTH ETRICS IN THINGS LIKE INFLAMMATION OR REDUCTIONS AND INFLAMMATION AND IMMUNITY IN THINGS OF THAT SORT SO WITH THAT IN MIND I LIKE TO DESCRIBE THE RESULTS OF A REALLY INTERESTING RECENT STUDY THOSE PUBLISH IN THE GERNAL BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND IMMUNITY THIS WAS PUBLISHED TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE TITLE OF THE OF THE STUDY IS EXPLORING NERAL MECHANISMS OF THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF GRATITUDE IN WOMEN ARANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL THE FIRST AUTHOR IS HASLET AND BASICALLY WHAT THIS PAPER SHOWED WAS THAT WOMEN WHO HAD A REGULAR GRATITUDE PRACTICE OF THE SORT THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT UP UNTIL NOW SHOWED REDUCTIONS IN A MIGDALA ACTIVITY BRAIN AREA ASSOCIATE WITH THREAT DETECTION A INTIMATE PART OF THE FEAR NETWORK IN THE BRAINS O REDUCTIONS IN AMMIGDOLA ACTIVATION AND LARGE REDUCTIONS IN THE PREDUCTION OF SOMETHING CALLED T AN F ALFA TUMER NECROSIS FACTOR ALFA AND IL SIX INTERLUKAN SIX NOW IF YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE LISTENED TO THE EPISODE THAT I DID ON ACTIVATING YOUR IMUNE SYSTEM AND IMMUNE FUNCTION YOU HEARD ABOUT T AN F ALFA AND IL SIX T N F ALFAN IL SIX ARE IN FLAMMATORY SIDE OF KINDS THESE OR CHEMICALS THAT EXIST IN YOUR BODY AND THAT ARE RELEASED FROM CELLS WHEND THERE IS DAMAGE OR CUT  A SYSTEMIC STRESS WHEN YOUR SYSTEM IS INDIRESTS AND IN THE SHORT TERM THEY CAN BE BENEFICIAL THEY CAN CALL IN SIGNALS FOR WOUND HEALING AND REPAIR OF CELLS ET CETERA BUT YOU DON'T WANT T AN F ALFA AND IL SIX LEVELS TO BE TOO HIGH AND YOU DON'T WANT THOSE LEVELS TO BE UP FOR TOO LONG AND SO THIS STUDIES REALLY NICE BECAUSE THEY SHOWED SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS IN REDUCING T AN F ALFA AND IL SIX IN RESPONSE TO A GRATITUDE PRACTICE AND BECAUSE THEY ALSO OBSERVED REDUCTIONS IN A MIGDULA ACTIVATION THIS AREA ASSOCIATE WITH THREAT DETECTION IN FEAR IT'S LIKELY AND I SHOULD EMPHASIZE LIKELY CAUSE I DON'T KNOW THAT THE DIRECTION OF THE EFFECT IS THAT THERE ARE NERL CIRCUIT CHANGES WHICH IN TURN SHIFT THE DEGREE TO WHICH THESE INFLAMMATORY SIDA KINDS ARE RELEASED IN THE BODY ALTHOUGH FOR ALL I KNOW IT COULD BE THE OTHER WAY TO IT COULD BE THAT HAVING A GRATITUDE PRACTICE SHIFTS SOMETHING ABOUT HEART RADE AND BREATHING WHICH IN TURN SHIFTS THE A LOWERS THE AMOUNT OF T AN F ALFAD IL SIX AND THAT INTERN REDUCES ACTIVATION THE MAGO WE DON'T REALLY KNOW THE DIRECTION OF THE FE THE EFFECT SCUSE ME BUT IF I HAD TO SPECULATE I WOULD SPECULATE THAT IT WAS A SHIFTIN NERAL CIRCUITRY THAT LED TO A CHANGE IN THE CIRCUITS OF THE BODY AND ANOTHER INTERESTING ASPECT OF THE STUDY IS THAT THE REDUCTIONS IN A MIGDULA ACTIVATION AND THE REDUCTIONS IN T N F ALFA AND IL SIX WERE VERY RAPID THEY OCCURRED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE GRATITUDE PRACTICE WAS COMPLETED AND EVEN THOUGH THAT STUDY WAS PERFORMED EXCLUSIVELY ON FEMALE SUBJECTS BASED ON THE BIOLOGY AND CIRCUITORY OF THE MIGDULA AND THE BIOLOGY OF T AN F ALFA AND IL SIX PERFORMING THIS INFLAMMATORY ROLL IN BOTH MEN AND WOMEN I DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY THE RESULTS OF T AT STUDY WOULDN'T PERTAIN TO BOTH MEN AND WOMEN SO WHAT ABOUT THE CHEMISTRY ASSOCIATED WITH GRATITUDE ARE THERE CERTAIN CHEMICALS IN OUR BRAIN OR THAT WE COULD ENHANC IN OUR BRAIN THAT WOULD ENHANCE OUR GRATITUDE PRACTICE INDEED THERE ARE AND EARLIERE I MENTION THE CHEMICAL THE NORMODULATOR CERETONAN AS HAVING A POWERFUL INFLUENCE ON THE ACTIVATION OF NORAL SIRCUITS ASSOCIATE WITH PROSOCIAL BEHAVIORS IN GRATITUDE ANOTHER SORT OF FEEL GOOD BEHAVIORS TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT NERMAGULAYERS LIKE DOPOMINE AND EPINEPRANAND NOREPINEFRAN TEND TO PLACE US INTO A STATE OF EXTERECEPTION MEANING A STATE OF OBSERVING THINGS AND FOCUSSING ON THINGS OUTSIDE THE IMMEDIATE REACH OF OUR BODY AN CONFINES OF OUR SKIN THEY TEND TO PUT US IN PURSUIT OR IN THINKING ABOUT THINGS OUT IN THE FUTURE OR OUT AWAY FROM OUR PHYSICAL BODY WHEREAS THE NEMAGULAYER CERETONAN AND SOME OF THE ASSOCIATED PATHWAYS LIKE OXITOSIN AND OTHER NORCHEMICALS TEND TO I WONT EMCIZE TEND TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH STATES THAT ARE ABOUT CONTENTMENT WITH WHAT WE HAVE WITHIN THE CONFINES OF OUR BODY AND OUR IMMEDIATE EXPERIENCE SO THEY'RE NOT SO MUCH ABOUT PURSUIT BUT ABOUT GRATITUDE AND ABOUT APPRECIATION FOR WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE I BE REMISS IF I DIDND A THEREFORE POINT OUT THAT IF ONE WERE TO SHIFT O THEIR CHEMISTRY TOWARD HAVING HIGHER LEVELS OF CERETONAN YOU WOULD BY ALL LOGIC EXPERIENCE HEIGHTEN LEVELS OF GRATITUDE AND INDEED SOME PEOPLE DO THIS THEY WILL TAKE COMPOUNDS THAT INCREASE CERETONAN THERE ARE NUMBER OF COMPOUNDS OUT THERE AS YOU KNOW I'M CERTAINLY NOT SUGGESTING PEOPLE DO THAT A COUPLE OF THE SUPPLEMENT BASED LEGAL OVER THE COUNTER APPROACHES TO THIS ARE THINGS LIKE FIVE H T P WHICH IS A PRECURSIR TO CERETONAN SOME PEOPLE WILL TAKE FIVE H T PS WHO TRY AND ENHANCE THEIR SLEEP I'M NOT A FAN OF DOING THAT PERSONALLY I'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS IN THE SLEEP EPISODE BUT THE STATE THAT WE CALL SLEEP HAS A VERY COMPLEX AND IMPORTANT ARCHITECTURE AS IT RELATES TO NEROCHEMICALS AND BY TAKING CRATONAN BY SUPPLEMENT OR BY STIMULATING CERETONAND RELEASED BY SUPPLEMENT WITH FIVE H T P OR WITH TRIP TO FAN WHICH IS A MENOACIPRECERCIRTA TO CERETONAN ONE CAN RUN INTO THE PROBLEM OF DISERRUPTING THE NORMAL ARCHITECTURE OF SLEEP CYCLES THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT I EXPERIENCE THAT AS IF I'VE TAKEN FIVE H T P OR TRIP TO FAN I FALL ASLEEP VERY DEEPLY BUTHEN I WAKE UP THREE HOURS LATOR AND I CAN'T FALL ASLEEP AT ALL AND ACTUALLY ATE SOMETIMES EVEN MESSES UP MY SLEEP THE SUBSEQUENT NIGHT SOME PEOPLE ARE NOT SO SENSITIVE TO FIVE H TP AN TRIP TOFAN AND ASHY REALLY LIKE IT SO AGAIN YOU HAVE TO TALK YOUR DOCTOR DECIDE WHAT STRIHE FOR YOU YOUR RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR HEALTH NOT ME AND YO HAVE TO DETERMINE WHAT WORKS FOR YOU EVERYONE SLIGHTLY INDIVIDUAL BUT ONE COULD IMAGINE ENHANCING THERE AMOUNT OF CERETONAN IN THEIR BRAIN AND BODY BY TAKING FIVE H T P OR TRIP TOFAN I BEFORE GRATITUDE PRACTICE THAT SEEMS A LITTLE BIT EXTREME GIVEN THAT THE GRATITUDE PRATIS ONLY ABOUT A MINUTE TO FIVE MINUTES LONG ON A REGULAR BASIS BUT THERE MAY BE INSTANCES IN WHICH OU REALLY TRYING TO AMPLIFY THE CIRCUITRY IN THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH GRATITUDE AND THEREFORE THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO EXPLORE THERE'S A NEW COMPOUND THAT'S OUT THERE A LEGAL OVER THE COUNTER COMPOUND AT LEAST IT'S A LEGAL IN THE UNITED STATES I DON'T KNOW ABOUT OVERSEES AND A THAT'S A COMPOUND CALLED CANA K A N N A  IT'S AN INTERESTING COMPOUND IT GOES BY ANOTHER NAME AS WELL A WHICH IS AND I'M GOING TO MISPRONOUNCE THIS AND I APOLOGIZE THIS IS CELESTIUM TORTOSUUM PLECE ARE A TIME STAMPS IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE SPELLING OF THAT A BUT ALL JUST CALL IT CANA FOR A BY ITS OTHER NAME FOR SHORT IT'S AN HERB THAT A IS TRADITIONALLY CHEWED A PRIOR TO STRESSING ENDEAVORS IS HOW IT'S DESCRIBED ON AN EXAMINED OT CALM BUT I LOOK AT SOME OF THE STUDIES ON THIS TI OF INTERESTING IT A VERY LIKELY INCREASES THE AMOUNT OF CERATONAN IN THE BODY AND PRETTY POTENTLY A IT IS GENERALLY TAKEN INDOSAGES OF ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY FIVE TO FIFTY MELOGRAMS AND IT CREATES AA KIND OF A PROSOSIAL A GRATITUDE ENHANCING WHERE I SHOULDS A GRATITUDE CIRCUITRY PROSOCIAL NERAL CIRCUITRY ENHANCING A EFFACT BECAUSE OF THE WAYS THAT IT INTERACTS WITH THE CIRTANURGIC PATHWAYSE OF THE BRAIN SO IT ALSO HAS ANOTHER NAME AT SOMETIMES CALLED ZEMBRAN Z E M B RE I N AGAIN I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT PEOPLE RUN OUT AND TAKE THIS STUFFITS BUT A THERE IS AN EMERGING PRACTICE A OF PEOPLE USING ZEMBRAN CELICIUM TORTOSIUM ALSO CALLED CONACE AN N A A IN ORDER TO ENHANCE THE STATES THAT ARE ABOUT COMFORT AND PLEASURE WITH WHAT ONE HAS IN THEIR IMMEDIATE A SPHERE OF EXPERIENCE AND SO ONE COULD IMAGINE A IF IT SAFE FOR YOU AN RIGHT FOR YOU AND LEGAL WHERE YOU LIVE A IN ENHANCING CERETONAN BY TAKING CANA AND THEN DOING YOUR GRATITUDE PRACTICE WHAT'S THE LOGIC BEHIND THAT WELL IT YOU KNOW OFTENTIMES WE HEAR ABOUT SUPPLEMENTS AND PHARMACOLOGY FOR QUOTIN QUOTE INCREASING PLASTICITY OPENING PLASTICITY IF YOU KNOW IF I HAD A DOLLAR FOREVERYTIME SOME ONE SAID I HEAR THAT SUCH AND SUCH OPENS PLASTICITY WELL INDEED THERE ARE MOLECULES ASSOCIATED WITH THE THING THAT WE CALLED NORAL PLASTICY BUT NERO PLASTICITY IS NOT AN EVENT IT'S A PROCESS MEANING HAS MANY MANY STEPS OCCURS DURING WAKEFULNESS IT'S CONSOLIDAY DURING SLEEP AND SO FORTH TAKING A SUBSTANCE THAT INCREASES AN NORACHEMICAL IN YOUR BRAIN WILL LIKELY PROVIDED IT'S THE RIGHT SUBSTANCE IN HITS THE RIGHT A A PRACTICE WILL LIKELY ENHANCE THE AMPLITUDE OR THE INTENSITY OF THAT PRACTICE AND MAKE IT A MORE POTENT FORM OF INDUCING YOURAL PLASTICITY MEANING IT WILL LA CREA LONGER LASTING OR MORE ROBUST BRAIN CHANGES THAN IF ONE HADN'T INCREASED THEIR CHEMISTRY IN THIS FARM A WAY THIS WAY OF TAKING SOMETHING BUT THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT YOU COULDN'T GET TO THE VERY SAME PLACE WITHOUT IT BIT SIMPLY DOING A SLIGHTLY LONG GER GRATITUDE PRACTICE OR PUTTING A LO BIT MORE MENTAL EFFORT INTO IT THAT SAID I THINK THE FUTURE OF NERL PLASTICITY REALLY RESIDES IN NOT JUST ONE APPROACH NOT JUST NERRO CHEMISTRY AND TAKING SUBSTANCES TO INCREASE IN OR PLASTICITY  NOT JUST BEHAVIORAL PRACTICES TO TRY AN INCREASE IN ORAL PLASTICITY NOT JUST BRAIN MACHINE INTERFASES OR A OR DEVISES TO INCREASE IN ERAL PLASTISY BUT RATHER THE CONVERGENCE OF MULTIBLE TOOLS SO YOU COULD IMAGINE ENHANCING SERETONURGIC TRANSMISSION AS WE SAY IN THE BRAIN USING SOMETHING LIKE CONA COMBINED WITH A GRATITUDE PRACTICE IN THE NOT TO DISTANT FUTURE THIS WILL PROBABLY ALSO BE COMBINED WITH SOME SORT OF A NON INVASIVE DEVICE TO STIMULATE THE PREFRONTAL QUARTECTS AT THE SAME TIME PLEASE DON'T DO THAT RECREATIONALLY THOSE DEVICES ARE FORCLINICAL USE ONLY CURRENTLY AH BUT I THINK YOU START TO GET THE IDEA SO FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE A LOBIT MORE EXPLORATORY ANDYOU WANT TO GO IN DO SOME READING ON THIS O I THOUGH YOU MIGHT FIND ACONA INTERESTING I I CERTAINLY DID THERE ARE NUMBER F STUDIES THAT WILL POP UP ON PUBMED I RECOMMEN A USING EXAMINED OT COMAS YOUR JUMPING OFF POINT THERE ARE SOME A DECENT STUDIES THAT THEY DESCRIBE IN THEIR SO CALLED HUMAN EFFECT MATRIC SO THOSE ARE STUDIES DONE ON HUMANS AND THE MAIN EFFECTS THAT THER THAT HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTS IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE ARE MINER BUT SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN COGNITION EXECUTIVE FUNCTION EXECUTIVE FUNCTION IS SOMETHING THAT S ALSO SOIATED WITH PREFRONTAL CRODICTS AND REDUCTIONS AND ANXIETY AND THAT SEEMS TO BE A COMMON THEME THAT WERE SEEING AGAIN AND AGAIN YOU SAW THIS IN THE STUDY A THAT THE TRIAL A WHERE SA REDUCTIONS IN TINEFALFA AND REDUCTIONS IN A MIGDAL ACTIVATIONTS O REWHICH WOULD OSTENSIBLY LEAD TO A REDUCTIONS IN ANXIETY YOUR SEEING INCREASES IN ACTIVITY IN BRAIN NEIR WORKS THEIR SOCIATE WITH FEELINGS O WELL BEING SO AGAIN THAT TO THAT KIND OF PUSHPULL OF DEFENSIVE ANXIETY AND FEAR LIKE CIRCUITRY IN THE BRAIN BEING ANTAGONISTIC AS WE SAY TO THE CIRCUITS THEIR SSOCIATE WITH PROSOCIAL FEELING GOOD RECEIVING GOOD FEELINGS TYPE CIRCUITRY AND EVENTS IN LIFE SO AS YOU NOW KNOW THERE IS A LOT OF SCIENCE ABOUT HOW GRATITUDE COMPOSITIVELY IMPACT NERL CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN ANTI AM FLAMITORY MARKERS IN THE BODY BRAIN HART BREATHING CORDINATION AND ON AND ON AND ON I LIKE TO JUST HIGH LIGHT THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE AT LEASET TOF MY KNOWLEDGE GRATITUDE PRACTICE AND WHEN I SAY THE MOST EFFECTIVE WHAT I AM DOING IS IAM GLEANING FROM THE SCIENTIFIC STUDIES I WAS ABLE TO FIND AND COMBINING THE VARIOUS FINDINGS OF THOSE STUDIES INTO WHAT I THINK IS A VERY PRACTICAL AND WHAT SHOULD CERTAINLY BE A VERY EFFECTIVE GRATITUDE PRACTICE FOR ALL THE POSIVE EFFECTS THAT WE DESCRIBED FIRST OF ALL THAT GRATITUDE PRACTICE HAS TO BE GROUNDED IN THE NARRATIVE MEANING A STORY YOU DON'T HAVE TO RECITE OR HEAR THAT STORY EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU DO THE GRATITUDE PRACTICE BUT YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT THAT STORY WAS AND WHAT THE GRATITUDE PRACTICE REFERENCES BACK TO SECOND OF ALL THAT STORY CAN BE ONE OF YOU RECEIVING GENUINE THANKS AND THE KEY ELEMENTS THERE ARE THAT YOU ARE THE ONE RECEIVING THE THANKS THE GRATITUDE AND THAT IT'S BEING GIVEN TO YOU GENUINELY WHOLE HEARTEDLY OR IT CAN BE A STORY OF YOU OBSERVING SOME ONE ELSE RECEIVING THANKS OR EXPRESSING THANKS AND THAT HAS TO BE A GENUINE INTERACTION AS WELL BOTH BETWEEN THE GIVER AND THE RECEIVER SO THOSE OF THE FIRST THREE ELEMENTS WHAT I RECOMMEND WOULD BE AFTER YOU'VE ESTABLISHED THE STORY THAT YOU WANT TO USE FOR YOUR GRATITUDE PRACTICE THAT YOU WRITE DOWN THREE OR FOUR SIMPLE BULLET POINTS THAT CAN SERVE AS SALIENT REMINDERS OF THAT STORY FOR YOU IT WILL  SERVE AS KIND OF A CUE FOR THAT STORY WITHOUT HAVING TO LISTEN TO OR A TALK OUT THE ENTIRE STORY IWOULD RECOMMEND WRITING DOWN SOMETHING ABOUT THE STATE THAT YOU OR THE OTHER PERSON WERE IN BEFORE THEY RECEIVED THE GRATITUDE THE STATE THAT YOU WERE IN OR THAT THE PERSON WAS IN AFTER THEY RECEIVE THE GRATITUDE AND ANY OTHER ELEMENTS THAT LEND SOME SORT OF EMOTIONAL WEIGHT OR TONE TO THE STORY THIS COULD BE THREE PAGES OF TEXT IF YOU LIKE OR I COULD JUST BE A COUPLE OF BULLET POINTS I DON'T THINK IT REALLY MATTERS THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT IT'S IMBEDDED IN YOUR MEMORY AND THAT IT'S REALLY ASSOCIATE WITH THIS GENUINE EXCHANGE OF THANKS AND THE RECEIVAL OF THANKS I THINK THOSE OF THE KEY ELEMENTS AND THEN IT'S VERY SIMPLE THE ENTIRE PRACTICE INVOLVES READING OFF THESE BULLET POINTS AS A CUE TO YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM OF THE SENSE OF GRATITUDE AND THEN FOR ABOUT ONE MINUTE WHICH IS A TRIVIAL AMOUNT OF TIME IF YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT IT OR MAYBE TWO MINUTES OR IF YOUARE REALLY AMBITIOUS UP TO FIVE MINUTES OF JUST REALLY FEELING IN TO THAT GENUINE EXPERIENCS OF HAVING RECEIVED GRATITUDE OR OBSERVED SOME ONE ELSE RECEIVING GRATITUDE AND THEN IN TERMS OF FREQUENCY THINK O A GOOD RULE OF THUMB WOULD BE TO DO THAT ABOUT THREE TIMES A WEEK AND THE TIME OF DAY DOESN'T REALLY MATTER I CAN'T SEE WHY THERE WOULD BE ANY SO CALLED CIRCADIAN EFFECTS OF THIS I KNOW SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO DO A GRATITUDE PRACTICE BEFORE THEY GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT I DON'T SEE ANY PROBLEM WITH DOING THIS BEFOREYOU GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT I ALSO DON'T SEE ANY PROBLEM WITH YOU DOING THIS ON YOUR LUNCH BREAK OR MIDMORNING OR FIRST THING IN THE MORNING I I CAN'T SEE ANY LOGIC FOR PLACING IT ANY ONE TIME OF DAY AND NOT ANOTHER SO I THINK THE MOST IMPORTAN THING IS THAT YOU DO IT AT LEAST THREE TIMES A WEEK AND AS MENTION BEFORE IT'S VERY VERY BRIEF SO THER ARE VERY FEW BARRIERS OF TO ENTRY FOR DOING THISE SO IF WE JUST TAKE A STEP BACK FROM THIS PROTOCALL AND COMPARE IT TO WHAT'S TYPICALLY OUT THERE IN THE LITERATURE WHICH IS YOU KNOW MAKE A LIST OF ALL THE THINGS YOUR THANKFUL FOR RECITE IN YOUR MIND ALL THE THINGS YOUR THANKFUL FOR COUNT YOUR BLESSINGSW I THING TAT EVERYBODY SHOULD BE COUNTIN THE BLESSINGS ALL THE TIME THERE'S AR ALWAYS SOMETHING TO BE THANKFUL FOR BUT IN TERMS OF A SCIENTIFICALLY GROUNDED GRATITUDE PRACTICE THAT AS ALSO SCIENTIFICALLY DEMONSTRATED TO SHIFT YOUR PHYSIOLOGY AT THE LEVEL OF YOUR MUN SYSTEM AND YOUR NERAL CIRCUITRY RE DUCING ANXIETY INCREASING MOTIVATION ALL THESE WONDERFUL THINGS THAT SO MANY OF US ARE CHASING ALL THE TIME AS GOALS I THINK A GRATITUDE PRACTICE REVEALS ITSELF TO BE AN IMMENSELY POWERFUL TOOL FOR ANY IN ALL OF US TO YUS AND THAT SHOULD COME AS NO SURPRISE BECAUSE THESE PRO SOCIAL CIRCUITS THESE CIRCUITS FOR GRATITUDE ARE NOT A RECENT PHENOMENON DISCUSSIONS ABOUT GRATITUDE DATE BACK HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF YEARS WE'VE DONE TO DAY AS TO TAKE THE MODERN SCIENCE RIGHT UP UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TO REALLY DISTILL FROM THAT THE NARROW IMAGING DATA THE NARROW CHEMISTRY THE VARIOUS ASPECTS OF BRAIN BODY CONICTIVITY LOOK AT THE PROTOCOLS TAKE VARIOUS SUBJECT GROUPS SOME WHERE DONE IND WOMEN SOMEWHERE DONE IN BETWEEN TO INDIVIDUALS SOMEWHERE DONE WITH BRAIN IMAGING ALL ALL THE VERY VARIOUS A A CHANGES ON A THEME THAT ALLOW US TO POINT TO A SIMPLE BUT VARY EFFECTIVE PROTOCOL THAT CERTAINLY WE COULDALL USE AROUND THANKSGIVING BUT A YOU NO THANKSGIVING IS JUST BUT ONE DAY THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE YEAR OF COURSE I PERSONALLY HAVE BEEN USING A GRATITUDE PROTOCOL FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS BUT THAT PROTOCOL WAS BASED ON MY A IGNORANCE REALLY ABOUT THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE A AND WAS MAINLY BASED ON WHAT I HAD HERD OUT THERE ON THE INNERNET WHICH IS THAT I SHOULD A LIST OUT OR THINK ABOUT OR OR VERBALLY RECITE THE THINGS THAT I'M GRATEFUL FOR A THE SORTOPROTOCOL THAT WE ARRIVED AT TODAY BASED ON THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE IS DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT A AND AS A CONSEQUENCE I HAVE STARTED TO SCRIPPT OUT A PROTOCOL IDENTICAL TO THE ONE I JUST DESCRIBED AND I INTEND TO USE THAT GOING FORWARD IF YOU LEARNING FROM END OR ENJOYING THIS PODCAST

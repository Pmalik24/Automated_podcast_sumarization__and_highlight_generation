WELCOME TO THE HUBERMAN LAD GUEST SERIES WHERE I AND AN EXPERT GUEST I GUST SCIENCE AN SCIENCE ACE TOO RINI MAND YOUR HUBERMEN AND OM OUR PROFESSOR OF NEUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY MARCH THE SECOND EPISODE IN THE SIX EPISODE SERIES WITH DOCTOR ANDY GALPIN A PROFESSOR OF CONNESIOLOGY AT CALSTATE UNIVERSIY FULLERTON AND ONE OF THE FOREMOST WORLD'S EXPERTS ON THE SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS OF METHODS TO INCREASE STRENGTH HYPERTROPHY AND ENDURANCE TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALL ABOUT HOW TO INCREASE STRENGTH SPEED AND HYPERTROPHY OF MUSCLES FPROFESSOR DOCTOR ANDY GALPIN GRAY TO BE BACK LAST EPISODE YOU TOLD US ABOUT THE NINE SPECIFIC ADAPTATIONS THAT EXERCISE CAN ENDUCE EVERYTHING FROM STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHE TO ENDURANCE MUSCULA NDURANCE SO ON AND SO FORTH AND YOU GIVE US THIS INCREDIBLE TOOL KIT OF FIT TESTS FOR EACH OF THOSE ADAPTATION SO THAT PEOPLE CAN ASSESS THEM FOR THEMSELVES AND THEN OF COURSE IMPROVE ON EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM IF THEY CHOOSE BY THE WAY PEOPLE CAN ACCESS THAT INFORMATION SIMPLY GOING TO THE FIRST EPISODE IN THIS SERIES WITH YOU AND IT'S ALL THERE IN TIME STAMPED AND I HOW THE RECOMMEN PEOPLE DO THAT TO DAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHY AND SO RIGHT OUT THE GATE AT IS ONE TO ASK YOU WHY SHOULD PEOPLE THINK ABOUT AND TRAIN FOR STRENGTH AND HYPERTROHY AND THAT QUESTION IS OF COURSE DIRECTED TOWARDS THOSE THAT ARE TRYING TO GET STRONGER AND GROW BIGGER MUSCLES BUT I KNOW THAT MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE PERHAPS HAVE NOT THOUGHT ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHY TRAINING AND HOW BENEFICIAL IT CAN BE NOCIOUS FOR PEOPLE THAT WHYN I GET BIGGER BYSEPS ET CETERA BUT THAT HAVE OTHER GOALS LONGEVITY GOALS AND HEALTH GOALS UNRELATED TO WHAT MOST PEOPLE ASSOCIATE WITH HYPERTROPHY SO WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF TRAINING FOR STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHY FOR THE EVERYDAY PERSON FOR THE ATHLETE FOR THE RECREATIONAL EXERCISOR AND SO ON THERE'S A WONDERFUL SAYING I THINK IS BILLBARMIN THE FOUNDER ONE THE FOUNDERS NACKY AND HE OWIS THAIT IF YOU HAVE A BODY OR ANATHLETE AND AND I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE ONEOF THE MAJOR TO SERVICES WE'VE DONE THIS FIELD IS CONVINCED PEOPLE THAT THINGS LIKE STRENGTH TRAINING ARE FOR ATHLETES OR FOR GROWING BIGGER MUSCLES AND CARDYO VASCOAR TRAINING ARE FOR THINGS LIKE FAT LOSS AND HART HEALTH AND THAT IS A TREMENDOUS TO SERVICE BECAUSE IT PUTS A LOT OF UNNECESSARY BARRIERS AND LEADS TO A LOT OF FALSE ASSUMPTIONS AND THEREFORE POOR ACTIONS A CLASS EXAMPLES OF THIS ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE RESISTANT TO STRENGTH TRAINING BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO PUT ON TOO MUCH MUSCLE PEOPLE WHO ONLY PERFORM ONE TYPE OF EXERCISE BECAUSE THEY WANT A FAT LOSS OR THEY'RE IN' IT FOR LONGJEVY AND HEALTH AND THEY DON'T WORRD THAN AT WORRIED ABOUT BEING IN ATHLETE IT'S A RIGHT OUT THE GATES WE CAN ACT TO DRAW BACK LITTLE BIT TO WHAT WE'RE ARE PREVIOUS CONVERSATION WHEN I WALK THROUGH THROUGH THE HISTORY F OF EXISE SCIENCE AND THE REASON I DID THAT IS TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND THES ARE THE RAIL ROADS THAT YOU'RE RUNNING DOWN AND OU DON'T EVEN REALIZE IT AN TERMS OF EVERY ONE THINKS OF STRENGTH TRAINING AND THEY IMMEDIATELY DEFAULT TO OR PRINCIPLES TO OPTIMIZE MUSCLE GROWTH AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY ADAPTATION ONE SHOULD BE AFTER WITH STRENGTH TRAINING WHEN WE THINK OF ENDURANCE TRAINING WE IMMEDIATELY TEFAULT TO THINGS LIKE AGAIN CARTY OF ASCOR HEALTH OR FAT LOSSER THINGS LIKE THAT WHAT I REALLY WANT TO DO ACROSS THIS ENTIRE A SERIES IN CONVERSATIONS IS TO TO JUST BREAK THAT IMMEDIATELY TALK ABOUT ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO WITH YOUR WITH YOUR TRAINING AND SO THAT PEOPLE CAN BE COMFORTABLE AND CONFIDENT IN DOING AN OPTIMAL TRAINING PROGRAM FOR WHATEVER GOL THEY HAVE WHETHER THAT BE SPECIFIC LIKE GROWING MUSCLE OR NON SPECIFIC LIKE JUST FEELING BETTER HAVING MORE ENERGY  BEING MORE PREPARED FOR LIFE AN AND LONGJEVYN AND SO TO DIRECTLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I COULD REALLY WE COULD DO A HUNDRED EPISODES ON THE BENEFITS OF EXERCISE AND WE COAN RUN ALL THE WAY FROM MOOD AND FOLCOS COGNITIVE TASKS TO A BETTER AMUN FUNCTION YOU'LL GET LESS COLDS YOU'LL BE YOU'LL FIGHT THEM OFF MORE EFFECTIVELY TO MORTALITY RIGHTSO SOME OF THE STRONGEST PREDICTORS OF HOW LONG AND HOW WELL YOU ILL LIVE ARE EXERCISE HOWEVER THERE ARE INDEPENDENT BENEFITS THAT COME FROM JUST ENDER AND STRAINING AND THEIRE INDEPENDENT BENEFITS THAT COME FROM STRENGTH TRAIN AND SO JU JUST GIVE YOU ONE CATEGORICALLY THE WAY TO YU WANT THINK ABOUT THIS IS RESISTANCE EXERCISE AND STRENGTH TRAINING IS THE NUMBER ONE TOOL TO COMBAT NEARA MUSCULAR AGING YOU CANNOT GET THAT THROUGH ANY OTHER FORM OF EXERCISE BESIDES HEAVY OVERLOAD STRENGTH TRAIN AND WE AN WE CAN WALK THROUGH IN DETAIL AT THAT IS BUT THAT IS REASON UMBER ONE IN GENERAL HUMAN MOVEMENT IS IS THE FUNCTION OF NUMBER ONE SOME SORT OF NURROW MUSCULAR ACTIVATION SO NERVES HAVE TO TURN ON THE SECOND PART IS MUSCLES HAVE TO CONTRACT AND THE THIRD PART IS THOSE MUSCLES HAVE TO MOVE ABONE AR IF YOU WANT TO BE ALIVE AND YOU WANT TO LIVE BY YOURSELF YOU HAVE TO BEABLE TO ENGAGE IN HUMAN MOVEMENT IF YOU HAVE ANY DISFUNCTION IN THE NURROW MUSCULAR SYSTEM THERE THAN YOU'RE NOT CAN BEAL TO DO THAT AND AGAIN AS I MENTION THE ONLY WAY TO PRESERVE THAT OR FIGHT THAT LOSS OF AGING IT IS TO STRENGTH DRAIN SO PEOPLE WILL TEND TO HEAR NUMBERS LIKE YOU LOSE ABOUT ONE PER CENT OF MUSCLE SIZE PER YEAR AFTER AGE ABOUT FORTY AND THAT'S TRUE HOWEVER WHAT THEY DON'T REALIZE IS YOU LOSE ABOUT TWO TO FOUR PER CENT OF YOUR STRENGTH PER YEAR SO THE LOSS OF STRENGTH IS ALMOST DOUBLE THAT THE LOSS OF MUSCLE MASCWOIF AGING MUSCLE POWER IS MORE LIKE EIGHT TO TEN PER CENT PER YEAR AND SO WE CAN VERY CLEARLY SEE THE PROBLEM YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE WITH AGING IS NOT GOING TO BE PRESERVATION O MUSCLE ALTHOUGH THAT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT IT'S GOING TO BE VERY SPECIFICALLY PRESERVATION OF MUSCLE POWER AND STRAING AND WHY THAT REALLY MATTERS IS YOUR ABILITY TO AGAIN STAND UP AN MOVE YOUR ABILITY TO CATCH YOURSELF FROM A FAULL YOUR ABILITY TO FEEL CONFIDENT DOING A MOVEMENT  THAT IS THE FUNCTION OF MUSCLE POWER MORE THAN IT IS MUSCLE SIZE AND SO FUN CTIONALITY IS REALLY WHAT WE WANT TO BE RIGHT YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO BE DUE PHYSICALLY AND FEEL CONFIDENT IN DOING THAT AS YOU ATE THAT'S GOING TO ONLY BE OBTAINED THROUGH STRENGTH TRAINING SO IS IT APPROPRIATE TO SAY THAT TRAINING FOR STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHE IS ALSO A WAY TO KEEP YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM HEALTHY AND YOUNG Y ABSOLUTELY IT IS THE ONLY EXERCISES WEREOUT WE HAVE OR THAT I YIF YOU LOOK AT JUST BASIC NUMBERS LIKE MOTOR UNITS YOU CAN TO SEE THAT OLDER INDIVIDUALS HAVE LIKE A THIRTY TO FORTY PER CENT REDUCTION TOTAL MOTOR UNITS SO WHEN YOU SAY OLDER APPROXIMATELY WHAT AGES ARE YOURE REFERRING TO CAUSE I KNOW MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE SUCH AS MYSELF ARE FORTY AND OLDER BUT I KNOW MANY OF OUR LISTENERS ARE IN THER TWENTIES MAY BEVEN IN THEIR TEENS AND I CAN IMAGINE THAT PEOPLE THAT START DOING STRENGTH AND YPERTROPHY TRAINING YOUNGER WILL AFFORD THEMSELVES IN ADVANTAGE OVER TIME BUT THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD BE DOING STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHY TRAINING FOR AS MUCH OF THEIR LIFE SPAN AS POSSIBLE THAT'S REALLY THE MESSAGE THAT I'M GETTING I SO IF SOMEBODY IS FOR INSTANCE FORTY FIVE WOULD THAT FALL INTO THE BEN OF OLDER YOURE IN A START SEEING DECRIMENTS PASS AGAIN AROUND THAT AGE OF FORTY OR SO ANOTHE'S A LOT OF GENETIC VARIATION THERE AND A LOT OF OTHER THINGS GOING TO THAT AQUATION LIKE YOUR SLEEP AND YOUR NETRITION BUT THAT'S A FAIR NUMBER O SORT OF THINK ABOUT IONE ACTUALLY RESPONSES IT'S ACTUALY SORT OF COUNTERTOT OF THE WONDERFUL THING ABOUT STRENGTH TRAINING IS YU DON'T ACTUALLY HALF TO START AT A YOUNG AGE IYOU CAN ACTUALLY IN FACT I WAS READIN A PAPER THIS MORNING BECAUSE OF OUR PREVIOUS CONVERSATION IT WAS IN OVER AGE NINETY SO THESE ARE FOLKS NINETY PLUS AND THEY SAW IMPROVEMENTS LIKE THIRTY O HUNDRED AND SEVENTY PER CENT IN THINGS LIKE MUSCLE SIZE AND IPERTROPHY OVER A VERY SHORT PERIOD TIME I THINK IT WAS TWELVE WEEKS SO YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HALF TO START THERE ARE SOME ADAPTATIONS THAT YOU'RE CONNEED FOR HEALTH THAT YOU YOU REALLY NED TO STARTIN YOUR TWENTIES THE REASON I LIKE TO MENTION THAT IS BECAUSE IF YOU ARE LESSENING YOU ARE FIFTY AND YOU LIKE CH I I HAVEN'T BEEN STRANGTH TRAINING YOU'RE NOT TOST YOU SHOULD ABSOLUTELY START NOW BUT YOU YOU GAN TO BE ABLE TO GET TO A A FANTASTIC SPOT VERY QUICKLY SIMILARLY TO IF YOU ARE TWENTY OR TWENTY FIVE AND THIRTY YOU AREN'T LIFTING THERE ARE STILL MANY REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD DO THAT NOW AND O I I'D LIKE TO POINT THAT OUT BECAUSE A LOT OF FOLKS WOULD BE LIKE ALL MY GOD THEY SAID I HAVE TO DO IT WHEN I'M TWENTY OR TWENTY FIVE OR AN O I'LL BE SO TO SCRUWE AND THAT'S NOT THE CASE AT ALL THERE'S REALLY NO AGE LIMIT ON THIS IN FACTERE'S ACTUALLY INTERESTING DAY THAT JUST CAME OUT SHOWING I'M DID THIS REDUCTION IN MUSCLE STRENGTH AND IPERTROPY THAT IS FOR TALKED ABOUT IS BASELY AMILIORATED WITH A PRESERVATION OF ACTIVITY IN OTHER WORDS YOU DON'T LOSE THESE FUNCTIONALITIES BECAUSE OF AGING YOUD LOSE THESE BECAUSE OF A LOSS OF TRAINING TO STATE THAT AGAIN YOU DON'T LOSE THESE BECAUSE OF SOME INNATE PHYSIOLOGICAL THING THAT HAPPENS WITH GENES BECOME LESS SENSITIVER YOU LOSE FUNCTIONALITY USED PRETTY MUCH CAN DESCRIBE THE LOSS OF FUNCTION OF STRENGTH AND MUSCLE IN AGING IS EXCLUSIVELY BECAUSE OF A LOSS OF TRAINING AN NITRICION AN AN ANIBOLIC RESISTANCE IN SOME OTHER THINGS SO YOU CAN DO A LOT MORE THAN YOU THINK I'M WHEN IT COMES TO MAINTAINING HIGH QUALITY MUSCLE AND THAT'S REALY IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT I'M REMINDED OF THE WORDS OF THE GREAT SHARRINGTON HE WON THE NOABILL PRIZE YOURE PHYSIOLOGISTS I GUESS THE NEUR SCIENTIST TRYING CLAIM HIM AS A NEROW SCIENTIST BICAUS HE WORKED ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THE PHYSIOLOGIST CLAIM AS OF AS HA PHYSIOLOGIST HE IS WANT HUNDRED PRERCENT OF PHYSIOLOGY I WOULD CALL M ONEUROW SCIENTISTS MAY BE WANK CAN ARGUE ABOUT THIS LATER A LE WELL GLED I THINK ONE OF THE KEY THINGS THAT SHERRINGTON POINTED OUT WAS THAT I DON'T BELIEVE THEY QUOTE WAS THAT MOVEMENT IS THE FINAL COMMON PATH AND WHAT HE WAS REFERRING TO AS TA FACT THAT I SIGNIFICANT FORACTION OF THE BRAIN ITSELF IS DEVOTED TO OUR ABILITY TO MOVE AND OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN RESISTANCE TIGHT MOVEMENTS AND THAT RESISTANCE TIGHT MOVEMENTS AND THE CONTINUATION OF MOVEMENT THROUGHOUT THE LIFE SPAN IS WHAT KEEPS THE BRAIN YOUNG AND HEALTHY AND VITAL AND THERE ARE SOME MUCH DATA NOW TO SUPPORT THAT BUT ID SO GRATEFUL THAT YOU BROUGHT UP EARLLY THIS FACT THAT THERE'S A NEURO MUSCULAR LENGTH AS I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK ABOUT MUSCO SKELETOL THEY FORGET THAT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IS REALLY IN CHARGE OF THE ON STRENGTH OF OF THE MUSCLE CONTRACTIONS AND THE TYPES OF MUSCLE CONTRACTIONS THAT OCCUR I'M CERTAIN WE'RE GIG TO GET INTO THAT IN A LOT OF DEBT TO DAY ORE CLOOK CLOSE THERE WERE NOT TOTALLY RIGHT BUT WORK CLOSE O KE WELL I I LOOK FORWARD TO BE CORRECTED YEM AND TO ACHIEVING THE PRECISION THAT YOU'RE KNOWN FOR AAROUND THAT DISCUSSION SO IF WE ARE TO STEP ACT AND SAY STRENGTH TRAINING AND HYPOROTUROPY TRAINING IS CRITICAL FOR PEOPLE OF ALL AGES YET FOR DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING THE NEUR MUSCULAR SYSTEM AND FOR OUR ABILITY TO FUNCTION IN THE WORLD YET NOT JUST OFF SAID INJURY BUT THE ABILY O PICK THINGS UP AND MOVE ET CETERA WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT STRENGTH AND HYPEROTROPY TRAINING I'M CAN PROVIDE I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE USE STRENGTH AND HYPORO TOBE TRAINING FOR CHANGING THEIR ESTHETICS YET WHAT IS YOUR SENSE ABOUT ITS POTENCY FOR CHANGING ESTHETICS AS COMPARED TO SAY PARTY ASCULAR EXERCISE YET THE THE MONTRA I ALWAYS LIKE IS THE REASON YOU WANT EXERCISES THREEFOLD RIGHT YOU WANT A LOOK GOOD FILL GOD PLAGUIT THAT THAT'S REALLY THAT COMES FROM SPORT I'M COMES FROM FOOTBALL SPECIFICALY WE AWAY SAID HATAND WHAT THAT MEANS REALLY IS YOU WANT TA LOOK GOOD PEOPLE WANT TO LOOK THE WAY THEY WANT TO LOOK WHATEVER THAT MEANS TO THEM HND THERE ARE ANY VERSIONS OF WHAT YOU FEEL TO BE ESTHETICALLY PLEASING AND THAT'S TOLLY A RELEVANT BUT PEOPLE WANT TO LOOK THE WAY ON LOOK I'M NUMBER TOO YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO FEEL GOOD WHAT'S THAT MEAN YOU WANT TO BE INJURY FREE YOU WANT O ENERGY THROUGHOUT THE DAY YOU WNT TO BILL TO EXECUTE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO SO  THAT YOU WANT T GO SERF IN THE MORNING YOU WANT UP A RACK O BALL YOU WANT A HIGHE OR YOU WANT TO DO ALL THREE OF THOSE IN ONE DAY YOU SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT I THENG YOU WNT A PLAGUEAT WHICH MEANS YOU SHO BILL TO EXECUTE I'M ANY GAN ACTIVITIES THAT YOU WANT EXECUTIO OF THE MEANS  SO BACKING ON WHAT'S I GOT IN THROUR QUESTION I'M ONE OF THE MAJOR BENEFITS OF STRAINGTH TRAINING IS THE RESPONSES TEND TO HAP AN EXTREMELY FAST SO YOU CAN SEE NOTICEABLE CHANGES AND MUSCLESISE CERTAINLY WITHIN A MONTH I ABSOLUTELY WITHIN SIX WEEKS AND SO WE HAVE THIS WONDERFUL FEED BACKLUE THAT SORT OF TELLS YOU AM I DOING THE SING CORRECTLY OH MY GOS YES I AM ALSO ITS VERY ADDICTING THE FEED BACK THE RESPONSE THE PHYSICAL CHANGES WHETHER THIS IS ACTUALLY POINT TWO OR THREE LOOK GOOD AR FILGOOD PLAGON OR IT'S EVEN JUST PART ONE YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE THAT WHEN YOU COMPARE THAT THE THINGS LIKE FAT LOSS THAT JOURNEY TENDS TO BE LONGER IT'S MORE DIFFICULT IT'S MORE RELYING UPON OTHER FACTORS LIKE NATRICION ET CETERA STRANG TRAINING IS REALLY ABOUT LIKE THERE'S SOME VERY MENAMAL YNUTRICIAN REQUIREMENTS OUTSIDE OF THAT IT COMES OUT OF THE TRAINING AND THE FEED BACK IS IMMEDIATE THAT'S POWERFUL BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK ACROSS  THE LITERATURE ON EXERCISE ADHERENTS YOU'LL SEE THAT THAT IS IN FACT THE NUMBER ONE PREDICTOR OF AFFECT IN THIS OF ANY TRAINING PROGRAMM SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS IF YOU WERE TO PUT ANY VARIABLE POSSIBLE AND FRIGALE WHAT IS GOING TO DETERMINE WHETHERE NOT THIS PROGRAM WORKS ITHIS IS WHAT WE TYPICALLY CALLD THE METHODS ARE MANY IN THE CONCEPTS ARE FEW SO THE METHODS OF EXERCISE THE METHODS OF STRENGTH TRAINING THE METH OF THE METHODS OF HYPERATRY TRANING WHICH WILL TALK ABOUT OR ART INFINITE HOWEVER THERE ARE ONLY A HANDFUL OF KEY CONCEPTS THAT YOU HAVE TO ACHIEVE IN ORD FER THAT PROGRAM TO WORK ADHERENTS IS ONE OF THEM AND AGAIN IS OFTEN THE TOP ONE SO YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING CONSISTENTLY WHEN YOU ARE GETTING THAT FEED BACK AND YOUR SEEING RESULTS IN YOUR APPEARANCE IMMEDIATELY AND YOU SEE THAT EVERY SINGLE DAY EVERY TIME YOU TAKE OFF YOUR SURED EVERY TIME YOU I'M LOOK IN THE REROR YOU SEE THAT RESULT THAT TENDS TO DRIVE ADHERENTS O REALLY POWERFULLY SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO GIVE PEOPLE WINDS E SPECIAL PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT MAY BE LIKE YOU AND I WHO ARE LIKE OMINOUS LIFT WEIGHTS AND OMAN EXERCISE LIKE NO MATTER WHAT THE RESTS MY LIFE AS I JUST LOVE IT NOT IN ONES LIKE THAT AND SO GIVING THEM A LITTLE BIT A CARAT OF SUCCESS AND IF YOU CAN ACHIEVE THAT IN YOU 'LL SAY THREE TO FORTO FIVE WEEKS ALREADY IT'S VERY POWERFUL TO M BEFORE I BEGIN ID LIKE TO EMPHASISE TOT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FOM MY TEACHING IND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS ALSO SEPARATE FROM DOCTOR GALPAN'S TEACHING AN RESEARCH ROLLS AT CALSTATE FULLERTON IT IS HOWEVER PART OF OUR DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRINGS YOUROCOSTIC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AN SCINCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME WED LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS MORMENTONS MOMENTOUS MAKE SUPPLEMENTS OF THE ABSOLUTE HIGHEST QUALITY THE HUBERMEN LAB PODCAST IS PROUD TO BE PARTNERING WITH FORMENTUS FOR SEVERAL IMPORTANT REASONS FIRST OF ALL AS I MENTION THEIR SUPPLEMENTS ARE OF EXTREMELY HIGH QUALITY SECOND OF ALL THEIRE SUPPLEMENTS ARE GENERALLY IN SINGLE INGREDIENT FORMULATIONS IF YOU'RE GOING TO DEVELOP A SUPPLEMENTATION PROTOCALL YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO FOCAS MAINLY ON USING SINGLE INGREDIENT FORMULATIONS WITH SINGLE INGREDIENT FORMULATIONS YOU CAN DEVISE THE MOST LOGICAL AND EFFECTIVE AND COST EFFECTIVE SUPPLEMENTATION REGIMENT FOR YOUR GOALS IN ADDITION MOMENTOUS SUPPLEMENTSHIP INTERNATIONALLY AND THIS IS OF COURSE IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE REALIZE THAT MANY OF THE HUBORN LADPODCAST LISTENERS RESIDE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IF YOU LIKE TO TRY THE VARIOUS SUPPLEMENTS MENTIONED ON THE HUBERMANLABPODCAST IN PARTICULAR SUPPLEMENTS FOR FORMON HEALTH FOR SLEEP DOPTIMIZATION FOR FOCUS AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS INCLUDING EXERCISE RECOVERY YOU CAN GO TO LIVEMOMENTOUS SPELLED O U S SO THAT LIVMOMENTOUS DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY EIGHT SLEEP EIGHT SLEEP MAKE SMART MATTRESS COVERS WITH COOLING HEATING AND SLEEP TRACKING CAPACITY I'VE BEEN USING AN EIGHT SLEEP MATTRESS COVER FOR ABOUT THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS AND IT HAS COMPLETELY TRANSFORMED BY SLEEP I'M SLEEPING ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT BUT I'M SLEEPING FAR DEEPER AND I'M NOW GETTING THE PROPER RATIOES OF SO CALLED RAPID EYE MOVENT OR REM SLEEP AND SLOW WAVE SLEEP AND WAKING UP FEELING FAR MORE RECOVERED MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY THE UNDERLYING MECHANISM FOR ALL THAT IS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD I'VE TALKED MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST AND ELSEWHERE ABOUT THE CRITICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SLEEP AND BODY TEMPERATURE THAT IS IN ORDER TO FALL ASLEEP AT NIGHT YOUR BODY NEEDS TO DROP BY ABOUT ONE TO THREE DEGREES IN TERMS OF CUOR BODY TEMPERATURE AND WAKING UP INVOLVES A ONE TO THREE DEGREE INCREES IN CUORBODY TEMPERATURE WITH EIGHT SLEEP ATRESS COVERS YOU CAN ADJUST THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT TO BE ONE TEMPERATURE AT THE START OF THE NIGHT A DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE THE MIDDLE THE NIGHT AND A DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE AS YOU APPROACH MORNING EACH OF WHICH CAN PLACE YOU INTO THE OPTIMAL STAGES OF SLEEP AND HAVE YOU WAKING OUP FEELING MORE REFRESHED THAN EVER IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY EIGHT SLEEP YOU CAN GO TO EIGHT SLEEP DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CHECK OUT THEIR POD THREE COVER AND SAVE A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS AT CHECKOUT EIGHT SLEEP CURRENTLY SHIPS IN THE U SA CANDADA UNITED KINGDOM SELECT COUNTRIES IN THE EU AND AUSTRALIA AGAIN THAT'S EIGHT SLEEP DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO SAVE A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS AT CHECKOUT TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY LEVELS LEVELS IS A PROGRAM THAT LETS YOU SEE HOW DIFFERENT FOODS AND ACTIVITIES AFFECT YOUR HEALTH BY GIVING YOU REAL TIME FEED BACK ON YOUR BLOOD GLUCOS YUSING A CONTINUOUS GLUCOS MONITOR MANY PEOPLE ARE AWARE THAT THEIR BLOOD SUGAR THAT IS THEIR BLOOD GLUCOS LEVEL IS CRITICAL FOR EVERYTHING FROM FAT LOSS TO MUSCLE GAIN TO HEALTHY COGNITION AND INDEED AGING OF THE BRAIN AND BODY MOST PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW HOWEVER HOW DIFFERENT FOODS AND D FER ANT ACTIVITIES INCLUDING EXERCISE OR DIFFERENT TEMPERATURED ENVIRONMENTS IMPACK THEIR BLOOD LUCOS LEVELS AND YET BLOODLUCOS IS EXQUISITELY SENSITIVE TO ALL OF THOSE THINGS I'V FOR STARTED USING LEVELS ABOUT A YEAR AGO AS A WAY TO UNDERSTAND HOW DIFFERENT FOODS EXERCISE AND TIMING OF FOOD RELATIVE TOEXERCISE AND QUALITY OF SLEEP AT NIGHT IMPACK MY BLOOD LUOS LEVELS AND I'VE LEARNED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT FROM USING LEVELS IT'S TAUGHT ME WHEN BEST TO EAT WHAT BEST TO EAT WHEN BEST TO EXERCISE HOW BEST TO EXERCISE AND HOW TO MODULATE MY ENTIRE SCADUAL FROM WORK TO EXERCISE AND EVEN MY SLEEP S IF YOUR INTEREST IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT LEVELS IN TRYING AT CONTINUOUS GLUCOS MONETER YOURSELF GO TO LEVELS DOT LINK SLASH HUBERMEN THAT'S LEVELS DOT LINK SLASH HUBERMEN LET'S TALK ABOUT STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHY IF YOU WOULD PLEASE REMIND US WHAT STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHE ARE IN TERMS OF THE SPECIFIC ADAPTATION THEY REPRESENT WHEN I ME N BY THAT IS WHEN SOMEBODY IS TRAINING FOR STRENGTH WHAT ARE THEY REALLY TRAINING FOR OBVIOUSLY IT MEANS THE ABILITY TO MOVE MORE WEIGHT BUT I KNOW THAT IT INCLUDES A UMBER OF OTHER THINGS THAS WELL AND WHEN ONE IS TRAINING FOR HYPERTROPHE FOR THE GROWTH OF MUSCLE FIBERS WHAT DOES THAT REPRESENT CAUSE I THINK IF PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT THEY WILL FAR BETTER UNDERSTAND THE METHODS AND PROTOCALLS THAT ARE GOING TO BE BEST FOR STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHY AT ITS CORE YOU YOU'VE BASELY DESCRIBED IT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT STRENGTH OR TALKING ABOUT AN ACTUAL FUNCTION SO CAN YOU CREATE MORE FORCE ACROSS A MUSCLE OR MUSCLE GROUPS OR ARE TOTAL MOVEMENT AND HEN WE TALK ABOUT HYPERCHUFOU NOW WERE SPECIFICY REFERRING TO JUST AN INCREASE IN SIZE THERE'S NO ACTUAL MENTION ALL FUNCTION SO A MUSCLE CAN GROW LARGER WITHOUT ACTUALLY TECHNICALLY BEING STRONGER FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS HOWEVER THERE IS A STRONG RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STRENGTH AND IPERTRRY SO LOT OF THE TIMES IN THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN THE LAY CONVERSATIONS WE SORT OF LUMP THOSE TWO THINGS IN AS THE SAME THING AND S WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE PEOPLE WHO ARE A NEW TO TRAINING OUR PEOPLE EVEN ARE INTERMEDIATELY TRAINED THERE IS A HUGE OVERLAP BETWEEN STRENGTH AND IPERTURY ONCE YOU GET PASS THAT THOUGH THEY BECOME DISENTANGLED AND A GOOD EXAMPLE OF IT IS THIS IF YOU LOOK AT THE STRONGEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD THIS WOULD BE PEOPLE WHO COMPETE IN THE SPORT OF POWER LIFTING RIGHT THAT'S A TRUE TEST OF MAXIMAL STRENGTH SO IT IS A DEAD LIFT TE BENCH PRESS AND A BACK SQUAT AND YOU'RE GOING TO DO A ONE REPETITION MAX AND ALL THREE THOSE AND SO WHOEVER WINDS IS HE PERSON WHO LIFTED THE MOST AMON OWEIGHT ONE TIME THAT'S IT IT'S NOT LIKE WORLD STRONGEST MAN WHERE IT IS HOW MANY REPS CAN YOU DO IN A ROAL OR YOUR TIME RIGHT IS A TRUE MAXIMAL STRENGTH TUS AND YOU COMPARE THOSE TO SAY BODY BUILDERS NOW BOTH OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE STRONG AND BOTH OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAVE A LOT OF MUSCLE HOWEVER IT IS EXTREMELY CLEAR THE POWER LIFTERS WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY STRONGER THEN THE BODY BUILDERS ON AVERAGE RIGHT THEIR INDIVIDUAL EXCEPTIONS BUT WERE JUST TALKING COLLECTIVE AVERAGES AND THE BODY BUILDERS WILL HAVE MORE MUSCLE THEN THE OTHER ONES IN ADDITION WHETHER YOU LOOK AT OLYMPIC WEIGHT LIFTING OR POWER LIFTING OR WORLD STRONGEST MAN FOR THAT MATTER THERE ARE WEIGHT CLASSES AND THE REASON IS AS YOU GO UP AND WEIGHT CLASSES YOU WILL ALWAYS SEE THE WORLD RECORDS GO HIGHER AND HIGER AND HIGHER RIGHT SO YOU CAN CLEARLY GET STRONGER WITHOUT ADDING ANY MUSCLE HOWEVER THERE'S A POINT RIGHT WERE YOU SIMPLY HAFE TO ADD MORE MASS TO GET A HIGHER NUMBER AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE WEIGHT CLASSES IN THOSE SPORTS AND IN COMBATSPORTS AND LOSS OF OTHER THINGS SO WE HAVE TH DIS A LOT OF CONFUSION RIGHT BECAUSE PEOPLE THINK MEN EITHER THESE ARE THE SAME THING THE OR IF I WANT AD GET STRONG OR I HAVE TO GET BIGGER WHICH IS NOT THE CASE AT ALL ANOTHER MIS NOMER HERE IS I CAN'T GET STRONGER UNLESS I ADD MUSCLE THAT'S NOT TRUE EITHER RIGHTNISS A SIMILAR IDEA SO WHAT WHAT I'M SAYING IS YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO WHATEVER YOU LIKE IF YOU'D LIKE TO GET STRONGER AND D MUSCLE GREAT IF YOU ADD MUSCLE YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO BRING SOME STRENGTH ALONG FOR THE RIGHT HOWEVER IF YOU WANT TO GET STRONGER AND YOU DON'T WANT TO AD MUSCLE FOR ANY REASON PERSONAL PREFERENCE ON ESTHETICS WHETHER YOUE IN A WAY CLASS NYOU SIMPLY CAN AFFORD IT IT IS QUITE EASY TO GET STRONGER OR NOT AD MUSH MUSCLEMAT EITHER AND SO DIFFERENTIATING THESE TWO THINGS IS ONE OF EM IS SIMPLY A MEASURE OF SIZE N OTHER ANT IS A MEASURE OF FOURSE AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT STRENGTH OR REALLY TALKING ABOUT OUR TWO UNIQUE COMPONENTS COMPONENT ONE IS WHAT I CALL THE PHYSIOLOGY SO WHAT WHAT IS THE ABILITY OF THE NR MUSCULAR SYSTEM WHAT IS THE ABILITY OF THE MUSCLE FIBERS TO CONTRACT AND PRODUCE FORCE THE OTHER ONE IS WE CALL MECHANICS AND MECHANICS IS SIMPLY THINGS LIKE IT'S MANUSIA DOWN TO HOW LONG YOUR FEMERS ARE RELATIVE YEAR TIBIA OR OR OTHER THINGS LIKE THIS IS BYD MECHANICS THIS IS ALSO TECHNIQUE THIS IS SKILL THIS IS HOW SMOOTHED YOU FEEL THIS IS ARE YOU FIRING THE RIGHT MUSCLE GROUP IN THE RIGHT SEQUENCE AND ORDER IN ALL OF THESE THINGS PLAYIN TO STRENGTH SO SOMEBODY WHO MAYBE HAS A MORE FORCE CEAPABILITY IN THEIR MUSCLE FIBRES BUT THEIR TECHNIQUE IN THE MOVEMENT IS WORSE MAY LOSE IN A COMPETITION OR SOMEBODY AGAIN WHOSE A LIKE IF YOU GOINTO THE WORLD OF SPEED AND POWER ESPECIALLY YOU'LL HEAR LOT PEOPLE TALK ABUT LIKE THE RHYTHEM AND THERE'S TIST A CERTAIN RHYTHM THAT HAS TO HAPPEN IF YOU WANT A JUMP AS HIGHEST POSSIBLE OR UN ASPOUTAS FAST AS POSSIBLE BUT THAT'S ALL MECHANICS AT THIS FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL SO WHEN WE LOOK AT HYPERTROPHE IT'S JUST STILL SIMPLY ABOUT HOW BIG THE MUSCLE IS SO THOSE ARE THE REALLY THE THE SIMILARITIES AND DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN STRENGTH AND I PERTROPY WHEN STRENGTH IMPROVES AND WHEN HYPERTROPHY INCREASES IS THERE ALSO INVOLVEMENT IN THE LIGAMENTS AND TENDENTS THAT IS OF COURSE THE LIGAMENTS INTENDENTS ARE INVOLVED IN THE MOVEMENTS AND YET BUT DULIGAMENTS ANDTENDENTS THEMSELVES GROW END ORGET STRONGER THIS FIELD IS REALLY DIFFICULT BECAUSE A CONNECTIVE TISSUE IS NOT BASCULAR AND SO THEIR PLASTICITY IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN SKELLON MUSS IN FACT IF YOU LOOK ACROSS ALL THE ORGANS A SKELL IN MUSCLE IS ONE OF IF NOT THE MOST PLASTIC MEANING IT'S THE MOST PLIABLE THE MOST RESPONSIVE I THEM ON IT'S GOING TO A JUST IT'S BASELY IT'S PAYING ATTENTION TO EVERYTHING THAT'S BEING SEID IN THE BODY A YOU CANNOT CHANGE BLOOD PRESSURE OR P H OR A MACCERNUTRANS FLOATING AROUND WITHOUT MUSCLE KNOWING ABOUT IT IT IS A A FACT THIS IS WHY WE CALL MUSCLE AN ORGAN PEOPLE DON'T TEN TO THING ABOUT THIS IF YOU ARE EVER ON LIKE JEOFARDY AND ASK YOU THAT QUESTION LIKE WHAT'S THE BIGGEST ORGAN SYSTEM IN THE BODY PEOPLE TEND TO SAY THE SKIN MUSCLES ACTUALLY CORRECT ANSWER I OMINO SITE YOU WHEN I GET IT YOUR ROT ON JEPARTY I DON'T HAVE ANY IMMEDIATE PLANTS YOUR YET EPERTY BUT WHO KNOWS OH THERY GO CELEBRITY JEOPARDY AND YOU HURAN RAG I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CELEBRITY PART BUT A JEBBERTY WOULD BE FUN YA BUT I WILL SAY THE MUSCLE AND I'LL ALL IF YOU GET IFOME CALL IN JEPPARDY I DON'T NOT HAVEN'T SEEN THAT SHON O VERY LONG TIME YI MAYBE EVER THEN ILL I'LL CALL YOU BUT THAT MAKES SAT AM THERL THE MUSCLES WOULD BE THE LARGEST ORGAN SYSTEM YE OUT THE REASON I'LL SAYING THAT IS SO MUSCLE IS BOTH LISTENING AND TALKING IT IS CONTROLLING ATHEEDEMIAN SYSTEM LOT IT'S CONTROLLING BLOOD GLOOKCLOSE REGULATION IT IS ITS THE CENTRAL DEEPO FOR A MEANOASSIS WHICH ARE NEEDED TO DO THINGS LIKE REGULATE THE IMUN SYSTEM BUILD A ANY NEW RED BLOODSELFSO LOT OF THE STUFF IS COMING FROM SCELLET A MUSSE SO IT WHEN WE SAY ORGAN BY THE WAY THAT'S ACTUAL LIKE A PHYSIOLOGICAL DEFINITION SO SOMETHING THAT'S COMMUNICATING A TO EITHER ANOTHER ORGAN ITSELF OR I THOUGHOUT THE SYSTEM SO IT'S LISTENING AND IT'S TALKING CONNECTE TISSUES NOT THE SAME WAY AND SO WE DO SEE ADAPTATIONS WITH STRENGTH TRAINING IM IN CONNECTIVE TISSUE IT'S JUST MUCH LOWER IT'S DIFFICULT TO MEASURE AM EFFECTIVELY WHAT WE KNOW NOW IS YOURECANTO HAVE A COMBINATION A OF ADAPTATIONS THROUGHOUT THE CONNECTIV TISSUE IT IS BENEFICIAL AH THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OFTHE MAJOR REASONS THAT'S THAT STRENGT TRAINING REDUCES INJURY RISK WHICH IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE PEOPLE WHO TEND TO WANT A PICK UP AN EXERCISE ROUTINE AFTER SAY TEN YEARS  THE THE CLASSICALLY SHAS LIKE I PLAYED ALL THESE THINGS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND IM WENT TE COLLEGE GOT A JOB NOW I'M TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY FIVE OR WHATEVER AN YOU SORT OF WANT TO JUMP BACK INTO WHAT YOU DID YOU'RE TWENTY WELL THERE'S NO TISSUE TOLERANCE SLIHT AND WHAT WE ALMOST ALWAYS MEAN BY THAT IS CONNECTIVE TISSUE THE TOLERANCE IN THERE IT IS NOT READY FOR THE LOUDERE ABOUT TO HANDLE AND SO YOU GO THROUGH SOME MOVEMENT AND THEN BOM SPRAINS TARRS I YOU EVEN THE LIKE THE MORE SIGNIFICANT ONES AROUN AKEELY'S TAIR WHICH ISN'T REALLY SIDE LINE YOU SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS AND WE NO STRENGTH TRAINING AS A A LARGE ROLLIN INJURY DUCTION FOR STRESS AND STRAIN ARE OVER YOUSEINJURIES AND THAT SPECIFICALLY COMING FOR THE CONNECTE TISSUADAPTITIONS AGAIN THE DIFFICULT PART HERE IS IT'S VERY HARD ESSESS WE ACTUALLY I WUT I WAS A DOCTRA STUDENT WE PLAYED AROUND WITH A PATELE TENANT BYOPSIES SO ACTUALLY HAD ONE IT'S LIKE A TEES OLD PIECE OF YOUR PROTELATTENAN MISSIN YE BECAUSE YOUR OWN YE ON LAD SO NOW IVE PROBABLY HAD I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY HUNDREDS OF BIOPSIES LIVE PERFORMED ON PEOPLE I'M PROBABLY WELL OVER A THOUSAND CERTAINLY WELL OVER A THOUSAND I'VE PROBABLY HAD THIRTY FIVE OR FORTY DONE O MYSELF I THERE'S NO PROBLEM YOUE I HAVE NO SCARTISSOE HAVE NO LOSS OF FUNCTION AND IVE STOCK NEEDLES IN EVERY LEG LIKE ALL OVER MYSELF RIKE QUADS A MY SOLELY IS GASTRO LIKE ALL AP TIKING TISSUE OUT YE YOU WANT THE NEEDLE LOOKS LIKE A PEN BASIALLY AND YOU YO YOU'RE LIVE N YOU GOING AN GRABIT CHUNKN YOU PULL IT OUT AND WE CANNIT COME TO YOUR LABING GET BY ABSOLUTELY AT YOU'RE RIGHT OH LOOKING UNDERTHE MICROSCOPIAL JUST LOOK LIKE THE MOLECULE CAFINE THERE'S TETHERE'S THEA MUSUAL FRIEND OF OURS WHO CAME DOWN ONTO THAT E'S A BIG BIG BIG GENTLEMEN BIG IN THE LIFTING VERY INTO STRENGTH TRAINING A AND HE YOU WEN TO THAT EXPERIENCE AND HE WAS LIKE AL MY GOSH IT WAS NOT WHAT HE WAS H UP AN ET HE ACTUALLY HAD UNBELIEVABLE MUSCLE MARPHOLOGY HIS FIBRS WERE AM THE DIAMETER OF MUSCLE FIBRES IS EXTREMELY LARGE I IT'S ON OF THE BIGAST CELLS BY VOLUME AN ALL ABIOLOGY SKELLIN A MUSSLIN HUMAN NHOL YARGE I HELP MYSELF AM MILLIMETERS WELL  YOU SO YET LENGTH WRITING YOU HAVE WITH RIG SO LENGTHWISE IT CAN BE EXTRAORDINARY LONG YOU CAN BE A THE CLASSIF EXAMPLES LIKE YOUR SARTORIOUS ITH IS LIKE THE FRONT OF YOUR HIP TO THE INSIDE OF YOUR KNEE CAP THEORETICALLY THOSE SELLS CAN RUN THE ENTIRE LENGTH WHITH SOULD BE ONE MUSCLE FIBRE RUNNING THAT THING UM IF YE FAR TO DE BIUPS AN YOU AND I I PULL THAT TISSUE OUT I COULD ACTUALLY PULLIN INDIVIDUAL FIBR OUT WITH TWEEZERS AND HOLD IT UP AND YOU CAN SEE THAT WHOLE MUSCLE CELL YI'M BEFF NOT IN YENA HOW TO GET MY ASI AM YOU BE STONE HOWBIG THERE AN IT'S HIS WAS THE SIZE OF RHYNA SO THE DIAMETER OF HIS NOW HE HAS A A WELL DOCUMENTED ASSISTANCE IN THE AREA MUSCLE GROWTH WILL SEY A BUT YET LET THOSE CAN BE LARG SO WHAT WERE WE VEEN TALKING ABOUT THERE WELL I WAS ASKING ABOUT TENDONS AND LIGAMENTS YOT AM BECAUSE I LIKE TO UNDERSTAND THE VARIOUS TISSUES IN ORGAN SYSTEMS THAT ADAPT WHEN ONE GETS STRONGER WE HOSLE TISSUE GROWS AND I II DO ONE ASK ABOUT BONE UM AND HERE I'M NOT REFERRING TO AUL BONE MEN OR AL DENSITY WHAT I WAS GOING TO ASK IS WHETHER OR NOT BONE ITSELF CAN GROW AND GET STRONGER AND THE REASON I'M ASKING AS THERE'S A FAVORITE RESULT OF MINE I AVE ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT HUNDRED FAVORITE RESULTS THREE THOUSAND PET PEEVES AND THIRTY EIGHT HUNDRED PLUS A FAVORITE RESULTS A BUT ONE OF MY FAVOR RESULTS IS FROM ERIC KANDELL'S LAB AT COLUMBIA ERIC ONE THE NABL PRIZE FOR LEARNING A MEMORY AND HIS LABORATORY GOT RELY INTO THE EFFEXS OF EXERCISE ON LEARNING IN MEMORY  AND THEY HAD THIS INCREDIBLE RESULT WHICH IS THAT LOAD BEARING EXERCISE YET STIMULATES THE BONES TO RELEASE SOMETHING CALLED ALS OSTIO CALSON EXCUSE ME AND THEN OSTIO CALSON AXES A MORE LESS A HORMONE TRAVELS TO THE BRAIN AND ENHANCES THE MEMORY SYSTEMS IN THE BRAIN BY ENHANCING NER ON HEALTH THAT'S THE BASIT CROXOF OF THE STUDIES THERE WERE SEVERAL OF THESE AND THE MOMENT I SAW THE FIRST OF THOSE STUDIES THAT WILL HERE'S ANOTHER REASON TO DO RESISTANCE TYPE EXERCISE AND NOT JUST EROBIC EXERCISE AND THEN IT BRINGS TO MIND WHETHER OR NOT BONES THEMSELVES GET STRONGER WHEN WE DO RESISTANCE TRAINING I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT YES VERY CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED AND WE'VE KNOWN THAT FOR FOR MANY DECADES A YOU HAVE A DIMINISHING ABILITY TO DO SO WITH AGE APARTICULARLY A YOU NEED TO THIS IN YOUR TEENS AND TWENTIES ASOE CAN HAVE THE LARGEST ABILITY TO ENHANCE A BOMENTAL DENSITY AND IT'S PARTICULARLY RESPONSIVE TO AXIAL LOADING NOW I'M A MUSCLE GUY I'M NOT A BONE SPECIALISTS SO WE WOULD HAVE TO I CONSULT SOMEBODY WHO CAN GIVE YOU MORE POSITION HERE BUT THAT YOU WON AN AXIAL LOAD AND IT'S IT'S UP AND DOWN IT'S VERTICAL Y SO IT'S ALMOS TI GOT LIKE A CYLINDER COUT  WEIGHT OU THET ON THE SMALL END OF THE CYLINDER IT I'M BOTH SMALL ENDED THE SOLDERS YET IS NOMONE DOESN'T DO THIS IN THEIR TWENTIES ORTEENS HOWEVER CAN WE ASSUME THAT SOME DEGREE OF POSITIVE CHANGE WILL OCCUR IF THEY DO RESISTANCE TRAINING EV EN OF IT'S A SMALL FORACTION THE ANSWER IS YES I IT IS SMALL A WE HAVE WORKED WITH E NUMBER OF WOMEN IN OUR A OR RAPID HEALTH PROGRAMM AT THAT COME IN AND THEY ARE IN THEIR TWENTIES ANDTHEYRE N THEIR THIRTIES AND THEY HAVE SIGNIFICANT BONMENT OR DENSITY PRAMS AND EIGHT MONTHS LATER WE CAN SEE NOTICEABLE CHANGES THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE MEASURE MAN ERROR OF EVIDECS APOSITVG POSITIVE CHANGES CORRECT AND AND IF YOU WORKED WITH A THEREARE MANY PHYSICIANS OF SPECIALIZE INSE AREA YOU YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A NUTR NUTRICION HERE STRENGTHURIN ALONE IS PROBABLY NOT GOING TO GET YOU THERE PARTICULAY WITH WOMEN BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHY AND AND THERE'S A LOT GOING ON WITH THE PHYSIOLOGY AN BOUT CHEMISTRY SO YOU PROBABLY LIKE ALMOST SURELY NEEDED T HAVE SOME BLOOD CHEMISTRY DONE WITH THAT YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON MENSTRUAL CYCLEWISE IN FACT LIKE OFTEN TIMES WHAT WILL DO FOR OUR WOMEN VERY SPECIFICALLY IS WE USE A ATHINK AL THE RHYTHM BLUSS OF THIRTY DAY TAS YOU CAN ACTU O A SALEBARY TEST ACROSS THE ENTIRE MENSTRUAL CYCLE AND YOU CAN TAKE A SAMPLES IT'S ABOUT EVERY OTHER DAY SOU'LL GET FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN SAMPLES AND YOU GET A REALLY BEAUTIFUL PICTURE OF ITS HAPPENING HORMMONLY ACROSS THANHIRER MENSTRUAL CYCLE NTHAT'S REALLY RELLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE TYPICALLY FOR WOMEN IF YOU GET A SINGLE SAMPLE OR SIMPLE TIME POINT WHETHER IT'S SALIBARY EARN OR BLOOD YOU CAN HAVE A WELL LIKE A AORDER OF MAGNITUDE DIFFERENCE IN IN ANY NUMBER OF METRICS BECAUSE OF WHAT PHAS AR IN THIS IS ONE OF THEM MANY REASONS WHY IT'S BEEN SUCH A CHALLENGE TO DO A LOT OF PHYSIOLOGY RESEARCH WITH FEMALES SOME METRICS CHANGE THROUGHOUT THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE OTHERS DON'T LIKE STRENGTH IS A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE I CAN STRENGTHAND I CAN DO A WONDER AT MACCESS ON A WOMAN AT ANY POINT I DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT AT A CERTAIN PHASE OF THEIR MINSTRUAL CYCLE BECAUSE IT IT'S THE EVIDENCE I THINK IT'S PRETTY CALEARE AT THIS POINT THAT NUMBER WON'T CHANGE SO I HAVE NO QUAMS INCLUDING FEMALES IN ANY OF MY STUDIES WHERE STRENGTH IS AN ABSOLUTE  IS AN IMPORTANT DEPENDENT VARIABLE BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TO JUST AROUND MENSTRA CYCLE OTHER FACTORS LIKE ANYTHING IN IN BLOOD ANYTHING HORMONE RELATED YOU CAN'T HAVE TO AUTOMATICALLY ACCOUNT FOR I SO WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THOSE FOLKS SHOULD ABSOLUTY WORK WITH A QUALIFIED PHYSICIAN AND AND YOU YOU CAN HAVE TO GET SOME NUTRICIAN SUPPLEMENTATION POTENTIALLY AND THEN MAYBE EVEN SOME OTHER STUFF GOING ON TO MAKE THAT EVEN MORE COMPLICATED IF YOU'RE ON ANY FORM OF BIRTH CONTROL OR NOT THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE THE ENTIRE QUETION ESPECIALLY FOR TE HORMON BASE WIRTH CONTRUAL SO IT JUST GITS REALLY REALLY COMPLICATED TO ANSWER IT THOUGH YOU CAN SEE ADAPTATIONS THEY ARE SIGNIFICALLY DIMINISHED RELATIVE TO IF YOU AVE STARTED IN YOUR TEANS IN TWENTIES BUT THERE IS HOPE USEING TO WORK WITH SOMEBODY SPECIALIZE INSE N THAT AREA FE'R BOTH MEN AND WOMEN BOYS AND GIRLS WHAT ARE THE MAJOR ADAPTATIONS THAT OCCUR TO UNDERLY IMPROVEMENTS IN STRENGTH AND IF YOU WUD IF YOU COULD JUST PROVIDED BULL ET POINT LIST OF THAT AND THEN WE CAN DIVE INTO EACH OF THOSE IN DETAIL FOR INSTANCE OUR NERVES G T IN MORE EFFICIEN AT FIRING OUR BONES ENJOYING ADAPTATIONS IN DIFFERENT YOAVE BONE CONNECTIVE TISSUE RELATIONSHIPS THAT THAT UNDERLIE STRENGTH I'VE TO IMAGINE ALL THESE THINGS ARE HAPPENING BUT WHAT ARE THE THE MAJOR CHANGES THAT ARE OCURRING IN THOSE ORGANS AN ORGAN SYSTEMS THAT REFLECT SOME ONE'S ABILITY TO ON ONE DAY LIFT YOU KNOW A HUNDRED POUNDS AND THEN A WE HAVE LATER TO LIFT A A HUNDER N FIVE POUNDS NOW I'LL I'LL TRY TO KEEP TISCONDENSE AGAINIS COULD BE AN ENTIRE UNIVERSITY COURSE A I WILL ALSO TRY TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF BONES HERE SO NORMALLY AS A MUSCLEGY I ONLY I TAKE ALL THE CREDIT AND MUSCLE TURNS OUT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM GETS A LITTLE BIT OF CREDIT TO HERE THK YOU HAVE SO AS WE WALK THROUGH IT JUST IN AS AS A BIG PICTURE IF WE THINK ABOUT AGAIN WHAT CAUSES HUMAN MOVEMENT BASICALLY EVERYTHING ALONG THAT CHAIN WE'LL IMPROVE THE STRAINGT TRAINING AND I'M NOT REALLY BEING USING TOO MUCH HYPERBALLY THERE  IT'S QUITE IMPRESSIVE SO GOOT'S GOING FROM THE NERVOUS SYSTEM SIDED THE EQUATION WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN FOR HUMAN MOVEMENT IS A NERVE HAS TO SEND A SIGNAL THROUGH A MOTOR UNIT NOW MOTOR UNIT AIT IS COMES DOWN AND INTERVATES MULTIPLE MUSCLE FIBRES SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR ACTUAL MUSCLE IT'S NOT A THING IT IS A COMPONENT OF MANY INDIVIDUAL MUSCLE FIBRES YOU'VE GOT MILLIONS IF NOT MORE IM THINK OF IT LIKE A PONY TELL SO WE COLLECTIVELY SAY PONY TELLING YOU THINK OF IT AS AC ONE THING BUT REALLY A PONY TELL IS A COMMONATION OF TONS OF INDIVIDUAL HAIRS A MUSCLES THE SAME WAY SO THIS MOTOR UNIT COMES IN AND INTERVATES A LOT OF DISM DIFFERENT MUSCLE FIBRES NOW EVERY ONE OF THE FIBRES IN A MOTOR UNIT IS GENERALLY OF THE SAME FIBR TYPE SO FAST WHICH OR SLOATRIDGE AND THEY ARE NOT LAID OUT NEXT TO EACH OTHER IN THE MUSCLE THEY ARE SPREAD OUT A CROSS A HORIZONTALLY VERTICALLY AS WELL AS A CLOSER THE BONE AND FURTHER TO THE SERVICE SO THAT THEY'RE MOVED THROUGHOUT THE ENTIREWAY THIS IS WHAT ALIG YOU'DO HAVE SMOOTHER CONTRACTIONS AND YOU'LL HAVE SPECICITY AN THINGS LIKE THAT SO WE SEE IMPROVEMENTS FROM THE NER MUSCULAR SIDE LIKE FIRING RAINT WE SEE SINCRINIZATION IMPROVEMENTS A THAT THAT ARE COMING IN YOU ALSO SEE I'M IMPROVEMENTS IN THINGS LIKE I SEETL COLING RELEASE FROM THE PRECENAPTIC NER ON ISO YOU'RE GETTING IT FASTER WE SEE COWSING RECLYCLING IS IMPROVED BACK A TO THEIR SO IN  AN ORDER FOR WITHOUT WALKING INTO TOO MUCH OFTHE BOUT CHEMISTRY IN ORDER FOR A SIGNAL TO GO FROM NERVE TO MUSCLE THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A GAP THERE'S A PHYSICAL SPACE THAT HAPPENS AND AND WHAT HAPPENS AS YOU RELEASE THIS MOLCULE CALL THE SEL COLEN IS GOES INTO POSTANAP TE CLEFT AND THEN THAT ACTUALLY BINDS TO A RECEPTOR THAT RECEPTOR ACTUALLY OPENS UP A DOOR THAT LET'S SODIUM IN THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING SO'S NOT THE SEAL COING IHAT US SEEL COLING THEN SITS ON THAT RECEPTRECIHE IT'S BROKEN DOWN PUT BACK AND IN RECYCLE BACK UP IN THE PRECENAPTIC NERVE SIGHT THE FASTER YOU CAN DO THAT THE FASTER YOU CAN RECYCLE THAT SIGNAL AND SO ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT I DESCRIBE IN THAT ENTIRE SYSTEM IMPROVES AND HAS BEEN SHOWN TO TO TO INCREASE WITH TRAINING SO THAT ALONE IT IS GIVEN GIVE YOU BENEFITS WE HAVEANY WALK IN TO GETTING FROM ELECTRICAL SIGNAL NOW INTO AN ACTOPETENTIAL WHICH IS CAN A CAUSE A MUSCLE CONTRACTION SO GETTING FROM NERVE INTO THE MUSCLE WE SEE THIN EVERYTHING FROM IMPROVEMENTS THN WE CALL CONTRACTILITY WHICH MEANS THE MUSCLE FIBE THEMSELVES CAN PRODUCE MORE FORCE ORE MORE VELOCITY INDEPENDENT OF MUSCLE SIZE CHANGES DOES ANOTHER COMPONENT WHEN WE ASKE LIKE HOUSE HAT I GOT STRONGER WITHOUT GETTING BIGGER WELL IN THE MUSCLE FIBRE ITSELF IT'S ABILITY TO CONTRACT FORCE INCREASES IN THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE EVERYTHING LIKE THE SARCOPLAS IN RATICULUM WHICH IS THE PLACE THE STORES AND RELEASES A CALCIUM WHICH WAS WHAT'S NEEDED FOR THIS ENTIRE CROSS BRIDGE INERACTION FROM THE MYAS AN AN ACTIN I TO HAPPEN I KNOW A LOT OD EITHER'S LOST A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT YOUN'T GO LOOK AT SOMEOF THESE IMAGES THE SARCABOS MATHICKEUM GETS GET'S ACTIVE ITTED MORE GS MORE SANT IT IS BETTER A RELEASING CALCIUM BRINGING ABACK IN AND DOING IN AGAIN IM THE BOND BETWEEN THE CROSSBRIDGE THE MIASAN ACT AND GETS STRONGER I THE COUCYM AFFINITY IS THE PHRASE THAT WE USE THERE IM INCREASES SO WE WERELITY WALKING THROUGH ALMOST THE ENTIRE PROCESS OF SCUTTOMUS OF CONTRACTION HERE AND EVERY STEP ALONG THE WAY WE WE SEE IMPROVEMENT SO THAT NET RESULT IS WE SEE AGAIN MORE FORSE PRODUCTION INDEPENDENT OF ANY CHANGE IN SIZE INDEPENDENT OF ANY INCREASEIN CONTRACT OU UNITS WE DIDN'T ADD ANYTHING TO THE EQUATION WE DIDN'T CHANGE SIZE WE DID NOTHING BUT IMPROVE EFFICIENCY EFFECTIVELY INDEPENDENT OF THAT NOW WE CAN ACTALY STAR TALKING ABOUT CHANGING MUSCLE FIBRE TYPE SO WE CAN CHANGE OUR FIBRES FROM A SLOTREE FIBRE TO A FAST WITCH FIBR THAT ALONE IS GOING TO GIVE YOU MORE FORCE PRODUCTION AGAIN INDEPENDENT OF SIZE FASTERH FIBRES TEN TO BE LARGER THAN SULTRICE FIBRS BUT NOT ALWAYS ESPECIALLY IN THE PRESENCE OF ENDURANCE TRAINING SO IF YOU DO A LOT OF CONSISTEN INDURANCE TRAINING IT'S VERY COMMON FOR US TO FIND SOLDIRE FIBRES THAT ARE AS SIMILAR SIDES IF NOT LARGER OFTEN VERY OFTEN LARGER THEN THE FAST WID FIBRES SIF YOU DID US LOW FIBRS BIG SLOW VERY METABOLICALLY EFFECTIVE VIBRE SO EXTREMELY FATIGUE RESISTANT SO IT'S NOT A BAD THING TO CALL THEM SLOW IS LIKE WE TEN TO STAY FASTEST LOWAND SLET SLOW HAS IS NEGATIVE CONNITATION BUT IT'S THE QUITE HEALTHY LIKE FIBRE TYPE TO HAVE A' OUTSIDE OF THAT NOW WE HAVEN'T IN GOTTEN INTO THINGS LIKE PENATION ANGLE SO THIS IS A ANGLE AT WHICH AN MUSLE FIBROUS INTERACT WITH YOUR BONE SO WE TEND TO THINK ABOUT THIS IS LIKE A MUSCLE FIBROUS PULLING ON A MUSCLE WILL SOME OF THESE ARE WOREAINT IT IT ORE ALMOST TA NINETY DEGREE SO I FIBRE RUNS PERPENDICULAR INTO THE BONE AND SOME OF EM ARE CLOSER LIKE A FORTY FIVE DEGREE AND SOME OF A RECLOSER TO ALMOST PARALLEL AND THAT CONFERS A LOT OF UNIQUE MECHANICAL BENEFITS SO IN ONE AREA IT'S OCY GAN INCREASE FORCE PRODUCTION YOU GO THE OTHER DIRECTION INCREASES VELOCITY AND SO WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF CHANGES IN THE ANGLE AT WHICH THE MUSCLE INSERTS INTO THE BONE WE NOW WEARE ALREADY AN MECHANIC SIDE OF IT RIGHT SWEVE WE'VE INFLUENCE HOW EFFACTIVELY AT PULLS IM AND WITH ANY THESE THINGS IT'S ALWAYS A GIVEN TAKE SO YOU'RE GING TO GIVE UP IN THE CASE OF PONATION ANGLA YOU GING TO GIVE UP STRENGTH BUT YOU' CAN INCREASE VELO SHORTNING VELOCITY OR IF YOU WONT INCREASE VELOCITY YOU AN TO GIVE UP SORT OF STRENGTH'M WE HAVEN'T GOTT INTO ANY OF THE ENERGETICS AT ALL SO WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT INCREASING STORAGE OF PHOSPHOCREATING WHICH IS THE ENERGY I SYSTEM NEEDED TO POWER THAT MUSCLE CONTRACTION AT THE FASTEST POSSIBLE RATE SO WE COAND CONTINUE TO GO AS AS LONG AS YOU WANT HERE BUT A HOPEFUL YOU'RE GETTING THE POINT OF A LITTLE BITY OF THE ADIPTATIONS THAT OCCUR I THE REASON I WANT ACTUALLY HY I THINK THAT'S ELF IS IMPORTANT TO BRING A BACK I MADE FOR SMUSTERS I KNOW I TOOK DOWN A JOURNEY THERE IN YOUR DISIK WHAT THE HELL JUS HAPPEN THAT MATTERS BECAUSE AGAIN THIS IS THI SPECIFIC EXPLANATION FOR HOWS IF POSSIBLE THAT I GOT STRONGER BUT I DIDN'T GET BIGGER AND THIS IS ALSO LI STRENGTH AND I PERTHU FEE ARE INTERTWINED AND HEAVILY OVERLAPPED BUT AR NOT NECESSARILY THE SAME THING SO FOR EXAMPLE WEAKAN INCREASE MUSCLE SIZE AND ACTUALLY REDUCE STRENGTH BECAUSE OF US CALLED LATICE SPACING SO WHAT HAPPENS IS I'MYOUEREN'T YOU HAVE TO CON TO REMEMBER YOUR MUSCLE FIBRES ARE THESE LONG CYLINDERS AND OF THE WAY THAT THEY CONTRACT RREQUIRES AN OPTIMAL SPACE AND SO WHAT HAPPENS AS YOU HAV THIS MOLECULE CALLED ACTIN AND YOU AVE HIS MOLECULE CALLED A MYASIN MYASTAN SITS IN THE MIDDLE AND THERE ARE SIX ACTIN THAT SURROUND EACH INDIVIDUAL MYACIN AND I'M IN A THREE DIMENSIONAL CIRCLE HERE SO YOU HAD A OMYASON IN THE MIDDLE THE HOUSE OF THESE GALOBULAR HEADS ANDTHEY CAN REACH UP AND GRAB AND ACTIN AND AGAIN THERE SIX SORT OF AROUND THEM RANK I'M WELL ONE OF THINGS THAT CAN OCCUR IS IF THOSE THOSE ACTIN ARE TOO CLOSE TOGETHER SO I'MAGINE MY HANDS I'M I'M UM REACHING OUT DOING A GIANT TE RIT SOME HORES ON AUGHT THERE WELL IF MY FINGER TIPS ARE THE TIPS OF THE MYASIN AND I'M TRYING TO REACH UP AN GRAB AND ACTIN AND I WANT TO PULL THOSE ACTINS CLOSER TO MY FACE WELL THOSE ACT AND STACK ON TOP OF EACH OTHER AND THAT'S WHAT ACTION MAKES YOUR MUSCLES GROW UP LIKE I FI FLECS MY BISEP IT ACTUALLY GROWS UP THREE OR FOUR INCHES CAUSE YOU'RE STACTING THESE THESE SARCOMERS O WHATHERE CALLED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER ARE I GREAT WELL IF I'M REACHING OUT TO GRAB THEM AND THE MUSCLE IS STRETCHED TOO FAR I CAN'T ACTUALLY MAKE THAT STRONG OF A CONNECTION IT WOULD BE LIKE IF I REACHED OUT AND GRAB SOMETHING THAT I CAN ONLY REACH MY LONGEST FINGER TIP ON IT WHEN I GO TO CONTRACT IT CAN'T MAKE THAT STRONG OF A CONTRACTION CAUSE MY GRIP IS WEAK MY GRIPS CAN A BREAK BEFORE I REACH MY STRENGTH LEMET IF I'M TOO CLOSHE THERE'S NOWHERE TO GO I'M ALREADYES CLOSE SO IF YOU ACTUALLY DISRUPT THAT LATIS SPACING TOO MUCH YOU CAN ACTUALLY LOSE A LITTLE BIT OF STRAING I' SO IT'S NOT THAT GETTING BIGGER WILL EVER MAKE YOU WEAKER IT'S SIMPLY THAT YOU'RE NOT OPTHIMIZING FOR STRENGTH YOU'RE SIMPLY OPTIMIZING I'M FOR SIZE AND SO THAT THAT CAN EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT  OF THE DISCANTGURITY BETWEEN GROWING AND PERFORMANCE I LIKE TO TO A BRIEF BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE OUR SPONSER ATHLETIC GREENS IV LET IT GREENS IS A VITIM IN MINERAL PROBIOTIC AND ADAPTED IUN DRINK DESIN TO HELP YOU MEET ALL F YOUR FOUNDATION OR NUTRITIONAL NEEDS I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLET AT GREENS DAILY SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SO I'M DELIGHTED THAT THE'R ARE SPONSOR OF THIS PODCAST REASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS ON THE REASON I STILL TAKE OUTHLETIC GREENS ONCE OR TWICE TO DAY IS THAT IT HELPS ME MEET ALL O MY FOUNDATION OR NUTRITIONAL NEEDS THAT IS IT COVERS MY VITEMENTS MY M INERALS IN THE PROBIATICS ARE A SPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO ME ITH LETI GRENS ALSO CONTAINS A DAPTOGENS WHICH YOURE CRITICAL FOR RECOVERING FROM STRASS FROM EXERCISE FROM WORK OR JUST GENERAL LIFE IF YOU LIKE TO TRY UT LETIT GREENS YOU CAN GO TO AT LETI GREENSTOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY'L GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACTS AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU YEAR SUPPLY OF VIT HIM INDEE THREE CAY TO AGAIN IF YU' LIKE TO TR UT LETIT GRENS GO TO T LETIT GREENSTOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER WHAT ARE A FEW OF THE MAJOR CHANGES THAT OCCUR IN MUSCLE NERVE ET CETERA WHEN WE EXPERIENCE HYPERTROPHY I'VE HEARD OF PROTINE SYNTHESIS YOTCHANGES I'M ASSUMING THAT'S TRUE MAYBE CAN TELL US A BIT MORE ABOUT THAT CHANGES IN BLOOD FLOW YET PERHAPS CHANGES IN NERL INTERVATION A WHO KNOWS MAYBE VEN CHANGES IN FAHIA I YE I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY SPECIFIC LY BUT 'M I HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT THER SOMEHOW INVOLVED SIR SO THE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HI PERCHAVE A LOT OF THE ADAPTATIONS ARE GOING TO BE SIMILAR BECAUSE THE THE MODE OF TRAINING IS CLOSE ENOUGH SO YOUR NERVES PROBABLY AREN'T SMART ENOUGH TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN U SET OF FIVE RAPS OR A SET OF EIGHT REPETITIONS  THERE' SOMARAPT TO DIFFERENTIATE ANYTHING LIKE THEY KNOW EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON BUT IT'S GOING TO BE HUGE OVERLAP THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE WITH HYPERTROPHE IS A COUPLE OF THINGS SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE MUSCLE MICRO STRUCTURE M I I'VE A WHOLE SERIES OF IDIOS ON YEUSE E IF YOU AN TO SEE THE VISUALS BEHIND THIS IN FACT IN THERE I INCLUDE THE SPECIFIC DIAMETER ISE AND MUSCLE FIBRS THAT I S FAILED TO GIVE YOU A FEW MINUTES TO AT WE WILL PROVIDE IN ENACTIVE LINK TO TH SO  WHAT HAPPENS IS THIS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT AND YOU HEAR THAT THIS CLASSIC BUZZ PHRASE OF MUSCLE PROTINE SYNTHESIS GENERALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THERE IS IS CONTRACT ON UNITS AND SO WHEN WE SAY CONTRACT O UNITS WERE TALKING ABOUT THE MYAS AND AN ACTIN AND SO ARE REALLY TRYING TO DO I SAY O CAM THERE'S SOME AMOUNT OF PROTINE TURNAOVER WHERE WE'RE COMING IN AND WE'RE TRYING TO ADD MORE PROTINES TO THE EQUATION AND SO IT HAS TO HAPPEN THERE IS A SERIES OF STEPS SO STEP NUMBER ONE IS THERE HAS TO BE SOME SORT OF SIGNAL FROM THE EXTERNAL WORLD ON THIS COULD ACTUALLY OFTEN TIMES ITS THINGS LIKE STRETCHING OF THE CELL WALL WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENES WITH EXERCISE RIGHTS YOU'RE CONTRACTING A SHOREAN YOU GET THIS BIG STRPED OF THE SELL WALL IT CAN'T COME FROM AS SIMPLE THINGS LIKE AND A MENOASCID INFUSION THIS IS JUST EATING PROCHING THIS IS WHY PROTINE INGESTION ALONE IS ANABOLIC I DO HELP YOU GROW MUSCLE INDEPENDENT OF EVEN MOVING A JUST EATING PROTINE WILL GROW YOUR MUSCLES YES CERTAINLY I KNOWS THAT THOSE DATARE ARE VERY CLEAR I'M   COURSE LIKE ANYTHING THERE'S A SATURATION POINT IN TERMS OF TOTAL AN NOT YOU NEED TO GET TO AND IN THINGS LIKE THAT BUT YEIF YOU WERE TO WLALK INTO A LABORATORY FASTED OVERNIGHT AND I GAVE YOU THIRTY GRAMS APPROACHINE WE WOULD SEE A VERY IMEASURABLE INCREASE IN PROATINE SYNTHEIS I'M QUITE CLEARLY FOR SEVERAL HOURS PROBABLY FORTOR FIVE PLUSS HOURS IM WE CAN MAYBE BRING US SOE PEOPLE OV TO KNOW THOSE DATA BETTER BUT MANY HOURS LEV NO WAITRON CORRECT I IMBEDDING THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT AWARE OF THAT FACT YOU NOW IT'S ACTUON INTERESTING ABOUT IT IS I IF YOU DO THEXACTIM STUDY AGAIN AND YOU JUST IT STRENGH TRAINING YOU WOULD ALSO SEE IN APROVEEN APPROACHING SYNTHESIS RI BUT THOSE FACTORS ARE INDEPENDENT AND THE MECHANISMS ARE INDEPENDET SUCH THAT IF YOU DO THEM BOTH TO GETHER THEY STOCK ON TOP OF EACH OTHER WHICH IS REALLY WONDERFUL AND IF YOU ARE TO AD CARB HYDRATE INO THAT MIX NOW YOU'RE ACTUALLY ADDING FUEL FOR THE  ENTIRE MOT O MUSCLE PROACHING TO THIS IS PROCESS AND NOW YOU CAN A SEE EVEN ATEDED BENEFITS AND THIS IS WHY FOR SO MANY YEARS I THIS IS THAT BORE THE WHOLE LIKE POSTS EXERCISE ANABOLIC WINDOW THING WHICH IS LIKE YOU GOT TO GET CARBS AN PROACHING AN POSTS EXERCISE TO MAXIMIVES IM MUST I PRTRING NOW THAT TURNED OUT TO BE NIKE NOT TOTALLY TRUE IN TERMS OF WTHE WINDOW TRIN  DOL NOT BE AS STRICT AS PEOPLE INITIALLY I ASSERTED I  I RECALL BUT BUT THAT'S ILL I THING THAT SUPERINTERESTING THESE ARE PARALLEL PATHWAYS FOR FOR PROACING SYNTHESIS SIMPLY EATING APPROTINE IM WERE TRAINING EACH INDEPENDENTLY INCREASE IS PROACING SYNTHESIS I I CAN'T HLP BUT ASK IS THE SAME TRUE IF ONE DOESN'T ENDURANCE TYPE EXERCISE IF I GO OUT FOR A FORTY FIVE MINUTE JOG IM WHERE I CAN NAZAL BREATHE THE WHOLE TIME BUT IF I WERETO GO ANY FASTROT HAVE TO KICK OVER INTO MOUTH BREATHING AS WELL I CLED ISZOWN TO IS PRAO I WILL I SEE AN INCREASE IN PROACHING SYNTHESIS A SIMPLY IS HE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT JOG NOW THIS IS ONE OF A THE UNIN FACTORS OF STRENGTH TRAINING YOU YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SAY THEN FACT YOU D IT'S DIFFICULT TO MEASURE PROACING BREAK DOWN THAT'S BEEN AS EXTRAORDINARILY CHALLENGING ATN IN LABORATORY BUT YOU'RE NOT GINGTO SEE THOSE BENEFITS I IN FACT YOU' GIN TO SEE QUITE THE OPPOS CITIZEN IS AN A TIRE MOLECULAR CASCADE IM SO THIS IS KONTO HOUTWORK SO YOU HVE T HAVE SOME SOMMER SIGNAL ON THE OUTSIDE AND THIS CAN BE A  ENERGETIC SIGNAL I'M SO THIS COULD BE GLUCOS UP TAKE I COULD BE PROTING IN TAKE I COULD BE A PHYSICAL STRETCH IM WHAT HAPPENS IS ON THE SELL WALL THERE IS SOME SORT OF IT COULD BE TISTOSTRO RIGHTS AS TOSTRONE CONFINED TO BATARE AFTER NERTIC RECEPTORS AND THIS ACT OF IT'S H WHOLE SERIES OF CASCADES OF SIGNALLING PROACINES AND THISE PROTINGS BASK PLAY A GAME OF TELEPHONE SO ONE TELLS THE NECT ONE THAT DILS A EXT ONE IN A SORT OF WALKNIS INTERMEN WILL THAT MOLECULAR CASCADE ITS FUNDAMENTALLY THE SAME THING WHETHER REGARDLESS OF THE INSULT BUT THEY'RE DIFFERENT PATHWAYS AND SO THE PATHWAY FROM STRENGTH TRAINING AR PROACHING INGESTION IT'S GOING TO GO TO THE SAME NUCLIUS IT'S GONE ACT OF ATE A WHOLE SET OF GENE CASCADES IT AR AN TELL YOU TO TO GO THOUGH HIS ENTIRE PROCESS APPROCICENCES WHICH I'LL WALK THROUGH WITHOUT IS IN A SECOND IF YOU DO IN DURANCE TRAINING IT'S A DIFFERENT PATHWAY AND SO INSTEAD OF ACT FING THIS ENTIRE THING OF LIKE M TOUR AN A  T IN THIS THIS ANABOLIC SIGNLING CASADE IT'SGOING TO DO A DIFFERENT ONE IM WHICH YOU CAN THINK OF MOROF LIKE AS AM P Q I'M AN ENERGY SIGNALING THING SO THERE'S A CROSS OVER POINT HERE IN FACT WHAT ONE OF THINGS YOU'LL NOTICE IS M TOR AN   T DON'T REALLY INFLUENCE AM P Q I BUT THERE IS SOME LITERATURE THAT AN YEARS AGO SHOWED M P K WILL ACT OF ATE ANOTHER PPROTING CALLED AM TS TO AND THAT WILL ACTUALLY INHIBIT M TOR AN THAT WAS THE FIRST MOLECULAR EXPLANATION FOR THE QUOTUN CAL INTERFERENCE OF FECT OF ENDURANCE TRAINING ON I PPROCHIVE COULD YOU JUSTI A HIGHLAY FOR PEOPLE WHAT THIS IS BECAUSE AS YOU DESCRIBE THSE SIGNALLING PATHWAYS I DSOIN IT ON MAYWE JUST PUT IT A TOP CONTOUR EXPLANATION THE MTOUR PATHWAY IS SYNONYMOUS WIT SELL GROWTH YET BOTH DURING DEVELOPMENT AS ORGANISMS HUMANS INCLUDED MATURE AND SELLS GET LARGER MTORIS ABUNDANT IN THE SYSTEM TOSUS TO PUT IT QUITE SIMPLY AND THEN THE MPQU PATHWAY IN SOME OF THE METABOLIC SIGNALLING THAT YOU REFERRING TO IS MORE SYNONYMOUS WITH CARTOVASCULAR EXERCISE IFYO A BELEASE IN THE CONTECT THIS DISCUSSION AND FUAL UTILIZATION YET AND WILL YOU DESCRIBED AS A CROSS OVER POINT WERE CERTAIN FORMS OF EXERCISE CAN TAPPEN TO BOTH OF THESE YET BAT AT LEAST FOR SAKE OF THIS CONVERSATION WERE LARGELY SEPARATING THEM YET BECAUSE THE THE THE BY PRODUCT IS THE THING THAT THAT MATTERS HERE SO THE RESULT OF A MTOUR AND ACIT GETTING INTO THE NUCLEUS IS GOING TO BE INCREASE IN PROCING SYNTHESIS THE RESULT OF AM PQU RUNNING DOWN TO THE M IT IS GOING TO BE RESULTED INCREASING MATOCONTRABOGENESIS SO THE NET AUCOME IS DIFFERENT NOW I DID DO WANT O FLAGET VERY QUICKLY THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARILY COMPLICATED THING AND A IN FACT ON OUR LABORATORY WE WERE ABLE TO TO BE ONE OF THE FIRST THAT FIGURED OUT HOW TO MEASURE ALL THE DIFFERENT SUB UNITS OF M PIQUE AN INDIVIDUAL MUSCLES BY FIBR TYPE SO WHERE IS YOT RIPPING PEOPLE'S MUSCLES OUT OF THEIR KNEES AND THEIR YEPATELERTENNCE A SO ANTITISAND THE THEY'RE GENTLY REMOVING WIUNDER IRBE PROTOCAL OF CORS COR AM SO EVEN WHEN WE SAY SOME LIKE AMPIQU IT'S NOT ONE THING AMLY WE SAY THINGS LIKE MTOR IT'S NOT ONE THING EITHER IS YOU HAVE THE TOTAL AMOUNT THAT MATTERS YOU HAVE TH ACTIVATION ACTIVATION SIDES ARE MANY OF THEM SO IT'S NOT A SIMPLE AM IS WHAT IM LANG IN AT I JUST WANTI ET THE A BIG CONCEPT OF KIND OF WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE TE TO ACTUALLY KIND OF ANSWER YOUR QUESTION WHICH IS OKE SO HOW IS THA MUSCLELACTURY GROWING WUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS IS A LITTLE BIT OF HOW A PROTING SYNTHESIS OCCURS SO WHAT I'M GENERALLY MEANING IS YOU HAVE THE WHOLE BUNCH OF THE MEANLASSES IN THE SECTRY GOES BACK TO MAY BE LIKE MIDDLE SCHOOL BIOLOGY CLASS RIGHT SO IF YOU TAKE A MUNCH OF A MELASSES AND YOU COMBINED THEM TOGETHER WE GET THESE THINGS ALLED A PEPTITE RIGHT AND IF ANYONE IS EVER HEARD OF LIKE PEPTIPES THAT'S ALL IT REALLY MEANS YOU PUT A BUNCH OF THOSE TOGETHER YOU HAVE A POLLY PEPTITE YOU PUT A BUNH OF THOSE TOGETHER AND WE NOW HAVE APPROACHING SO ANY PROTAN I WANT A MAKE ITS GOING TO GO TO THE EXACT SAME SYSTEM TEXACT SAME STEPS IT DOESN'T MATTER F THAT PROTINE IS GOING TO BE A RED BLOOD SELL IT DOESN'T MATER THAT'S GOING TO BE A HERFOLICAL DOESN'T MATTER IS GING TO BE SKELLITA MUSCLE THAT'S BASICLY PROACHING SYNTSIS SO WHEN WE TEND TO THINK OF PROACHING SYNTHESIS WE WE JUST PAINT THIS PICTURE OF GROWING MORE MUSCLE AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY THING AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF HAVING HIGH QUALITY MUSCLEES BEING THIS PLACE THAT'S GOON TO REGULATE MOST OF YOUR PROACHING SYNTHESIS WE TEND TO LOSE SOME PEOPLE CAUSE HE'R THINKING I DON'T NEED TO GAIN MUSCLE AND THAT'S NOT WE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REGULATING EMEN SYSTEM A REGULAR WERE T ALCKNG ABOUT REGULATING ANY PROTINE TURN OVER SO ANY PROTINE THAT'S DEGRADATED OR NEEDS TO BE BROKEN DOWN IN YOUR IN YOUR SYSTEM AT ALL A TOPHAGY THIS IS THE INLIKE THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT BUZZWORD THAT'S JUST PROTINE BREAK DOWN OF OF AN UNNEEDED ORUR DAMAGE PROTINERE THAT WHOLE THING IS GOING TO GO THROUGH PROTINE SYNTHESIS TO BE ABLE TO COME BACK IN REPLACE  THINGS THE ONLY REASON YOU GO THROUGH A TOPHOGYS SO YOUCAN CLEAN THAT GARBAGE OUT AND THEN COME BACK AND BUILD AN A MORE PROPERLY FUNCTIONIN PROTY SO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT GROWING MORE MUSCLE MASSIS WHY YOU WANT THESE SYSTEMS TO BE OPERATING WELL SO THE PROTINE INGESTION IS GOING TO DISACTUATE THAT CASCAKE IS IS PASECAS SAYING O HEY LOOK WE HAVE AN ABUNDANCE OF SUPPLY HERE WHY DON'T WE MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF IT BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW THE NECT TIME THIS THING'S GOING TO BE ROUNT  CARBAHYDRASE IN FAT OR VERY EASY TO STORE PROTINE IS VERY CHALLENGING IT'S MORE TRANSIEN AND SO YOU CAN STORE SOM OF IT AND KEEP IT AROUND BUT MOST OF IT YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE AND SO WHEN IT'S AVAILABLE YOUR YOUR BODY WANTS TO ACT VERY QUICKLY IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY CARE IF YOU AV ECTURE FAT FLOWING AROUND YOUR SYSTEM ANS ARE IT LESSUS PACKAGE UPAN STOWERD WE CAN EASILY BRING THIS BACK OUT BUT IF YOU GOT PROTINE AROUND YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO USE IT AND SO THAT'S WHY IT ALONE WILL ACTIVATE AND INCREASE PROTINE SYNTHESIS AM INDEPENDENT OF EXERCISE SO THOSE EFFECTS ARE ADDATIVE LIKE A SAID BECAUSE THA SIGNALLING PROCES IS INDEPENDENT AND ONCE YOU HID A RATE LIMITING PHASE THAN IT YOU ARE YOU ARE THERE I BETTET IT'S ONSED THOSE THINGS WILL WORK INDEPENDENTLY OH  SO THAT BEING SAID WHAT IS SKELLED A MUSCLE HYPERTROPHY IN GENERAL WE THINK ABOUT IT AS THIS INCREASE IN CONTRACTALL PROTINE SOSE MYASAN ENACTAN EFFECT EFFECTUALLY GET THICKER AY NOW WHAT HAPPENS IS SINCE THEY ARE THICKER AND AS I TALKED ABOUT A SECOND AGO THAT INFLUENCES AND ACTUALLY HURTS THE LATTIST SPACING AND SO AT YOUR BODY DOES AS RESULT TO SAY HEY LET'S INCREASE THE DIAMETER OF THE ENTIRE CELL SO THAT WE CAN MAINTAIN OUR SPACING BETWEEN THESE THINGS RIGHT IT'S EFFECTLY LIKE IF IF YOU ON THE TWO OF US WERE SITTINGIN THIS ROOM AND YOU DOUBLED IN SIZE AND I WAS LIE WO YOU'RE MY PERSONAL SPACE LIKE I DOUBLE NESIZE NOW RN EACH OTHER SPACE THE AT SOME POINT WE JUST HAVE TO MAKE THE ROOM LARGER AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE CELL AND SO AS YOU CAN CONTINUE TO INCREASED MUSCLES SINE YOU CAN NAK AN AA MUSCLE MILE FOBTHER A ACRETIAN YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE MUSCLE FIBRO SIZE FOR YEARS THERE WAS THIS OTHER COMMET ABOUT AM NONFUNCTIONAL HYPERTROPHY AND THIS WIS OFTEN CALLD SARCO PLASMIC HIPERTROBY  THIS IS NOT SARCOPOSIC PERTICULUMS IS THE FANCY WAY OF SAYING MY MUSCLE IS LARGER BUT IT HAS NO FUNCTION AND THE QUESTION WOULD BE WILD THE HUSE UT POSSIBLE IF I HAVE MORE CONTRACTIL UNITS AND I CAN MAKE MORE THESE CROSS BRIDGIS PERFORM MORE OF THESE POWER STROKES IS WHAT THES CONTRACTIONS AR GOLL HOW COULD I POSSIBLY BE BE LOSING FUNCTION WELL IT THAT WAS CHALLENGE FOR THAT WAS PROCINS FOR A VERY VERY LONG TIME IN FACT WORE IT REALLY CAME DOWN TO AS ARE THERE DIFFERENT TYPES OF HYPERTRY TRAINING SOME THAT INDUCE CONTRACTILL PROTINE HIPERTROBY AND SOME THA INDUCE SAYS SARCOPUSM CYPERTROY AND THAT WAS THE SIGNIFILY CHALLENGE AND TELL REASONLY MIKE ROBERTS DID AT ARBERGE A SERIES OF WONDERFUL STUDIES A SHOWED QUITE CLEARLY THAT SARCOPOSMIC I PERCHAVEIS PROBABLY HAPPENING AND IN FACT THORE'S PROBABLY A PRETTY EASY EXPLANATION IN GENERAL WHAT HAPPENS IS IT IS IT IS A INCREASING FLUID IN THE MUSCLE FIBR AND SO THIS WOULD ALLOW FOR THE DIAME TO BE LARGER BUT SINCE THEREIS NO ADDITION OF CONTRACT IL UNITS NO MORE FORCE PRODUCTION HAPPENS AND SO HE ACTUA AS A WONDERFUL REVIEW PAPER I BELIEVE ITS OPEN ACCESS WE YOU CAN GO LOOK ANY CRATER O A WONDERFUL GRAPH I THIN TES SIN WHA IN MY HYPERTIVIDIOS ON UTIP AS WELL AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THAT IT'S LIKELY HAPPENING IN PHASIC CHANGES THROUGHOUT YOUR TRAINING EXPERIENCE SO AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR TRAINING BUT AS AS THE YEARS AND YEAR WEEKS RATHER MONTHS AND THEN EVENTUALLY YEARS GOBYING YOUR TRAINING WE HAVE A CHANGE IN THE HYPERTRAPY THAT'S COMING FROM A CONTRACT O UNITS VERSES SARCOPLAIC SO I THINK THAT IT IS AN IMPORTANT NOTE BECAUSE TE GAN PEOPLE WONDEING LIKE HOW THE HELL IS IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO GET LARGER MUSCLE AND SOMEHOW I'M NOT STRONGER WELL IF IT CAME FROM SIMPLY FLUID RETENSION AND THIS IS NOT BLOWING THIS IS NOT THERE'S OWN'T NEGATIVE REALLY TO THIS IT IS SIMPLY AM HOLDING OF A MORE HYDRATION IN THE CELL THE AMIGOUS LARGER AND THE EVERYTHING WORKS THAT WAY WHET YOU JUST DESCRIBE CALLS TO MIND SOMETHING SIMILAR IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM WHICH IS NEROW PLASTICITY ITERCOURSE SYS THE NERVOUS SYSTEMS ABILITY TO CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO LEARNING IND EXPERIENCE AND DAMAGE FOR THAT MATTER YET AND WE THINK ABOUT IT AS ONE TERM BUT THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT FORMS OF NARROW PLASTICITY YA AT DISCUSSION THAT WE DON'T NEED TO GET INTO NOW WIT THEIR SPIKE TIMING DEPENDENT PLACASY UNNELT P IND LONTERN DEPRESSION WHICH HAS NOTHING INTO WAT PSYCHOLOGICAL DEPRESS YO AND ON AND PAR PULSE FACILITATION AND ON AND ON AND ON IN SHORT TURNE PLASTICITY AND SO WHAT I'M STARTING TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT THERE ARE MANY PATHS TO WHAT WE CALL STRENGTH INCREASE AND THERE MANY PATHS TO WHAT WE THINK OF AS HYPERTROPHY MANY OF THESE ARE GOING TO OPERATE IN PARALLEL IT'S GOING TO BE RARE THAT ANY ONE OF THEM IS GOING TO BE ACTIVE ALONE YET IN ORDER TO CREATE HYPERTRAPHY OUR STRAIN CHANGES AND THAT CERTAIN FORMS OF EXERCISE AND CERTAIN WAYS OF DOING EXERCISES IN TERMS OF SETS AND REPETITION SCHEMES AND REST INTERVALS BETWEEN SETS AND BETWEEN TRAINING SESSIONS ARE GOING TO TAPP IN TO DIFFERENT MECHANISMS BUT ALSO OVERLAPPING SETS OF MECHANISMS WHICH IS WHY IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY YOU MENTION AT THE BEGINNING THAT OFTEN NOT ALWAYS BUT OFTEN STRENGTH INCREASES ARE ASSOCIATE WITH SOME HYPERTROPHE CHANGES AND HYPERTROPHY INCREASES ARE OFTEN NOT ALWAYS ASSOCIATE WITH STRENGTH INCREASES TO HAVE THAT RIGHT CORRECT AND THE BEAUTY OF THIS WHOLE THING IS WHILE WE DON'T YET KNOW THE MECHANISM SPECIFICALLY AND AS A LOT OF CONFUSION THIS A LOT O CHANGES THAT HAPPENED THERE'S A WE ACTUALLY JUST SUBMITTED A PAPER A FEW DAYS AGO IM MYSELF A JIMMY BAGLEY AT SANCISCO AND CEVAMERIC AT THEONES HAS A WONDERFUL MUSCLE PHYSIOLOGY LAB IT ARCANSON AND WE WE WE ACTUALLY ITIS B ARY LAY ARTICLE ACTUALLY IT'S INCREDIBLY ESIN READ  WE DESCRIBE THE THE ROLE OF MY NUCLIATION IN A MUSCLI PERTRY AND THIS IS ACTUALLY LOT O ENTE SUPTING ET INTO THERE BUT WERE WE'RE LEARNING MORE AND MORE ABOUT IT AS A QUICK EXAMPLE SO SKELL IN MUSCLE IS UNIQUE IN THE FACT THAT IT IS SO LARGE IN DIAMETER IT'S ALL SO UNIQUE IN THE FACT THAT TO MULTI NUCLIATED WHAT THAT MEANS IS ATYPICALLY IN BIOLOGY YOU SEE LIKE A CELL HOUSE ONE NEUCLIOUS THAT'S THE PLACE THAT HOUSES AND HOLD TO DENAND IT'S THE CONTROL CENTR THELLS IT TO GROW SHRINK DI REPAIR THAT WHOLE THING WELL SKELLIN MUSCLE IN HUMAN AS OSSON BECAUSE IT HAS THOUSANDS IF NOT MORE THS NEUCLY I WHICH GIVES IT THAT PLASTICITY AND SO A NORMAL CELL HAS ONE PLACE THIT HAS TO GO TO FOR ANY TIME AT ONCE TO UPREGULATE DOWN REGULATE DO WHATEVER THE THING IS YOURN MUSCLE FIBRES HAVE THESE LITAL CONTROL CENTERS ALL THROUGHOUT THEM AND FOR YEARS WE WERE LIKE OC GRAY THE AMOUNT OF HYPERTROPHE THE YOU CAN EXPERIENCE IS PROBABLY LIMITED BY THE AMOUNT OF NUCLY I YOU HAVE BECAUSE YOU'R NOT GOING TO EXSEED A CERTAIN SIZE OF MUSCLE FIBRE IF THAT'S GOING TO MEAN YOU LOOSE CONTROL AND SO WE'RE LIKE O CAKE GREAT WE FOUND AND IDENTIFYIND A LIMITING FACT OR TO WHAT WILL DETERMINE HOW MUCH I MUSCLE CAN ACTUALLY GROW AND THEN THE NEXT QUESTION WAS AN THEN WEAR THESE SINCE COMING FROM AND THIS IS WERE SADLE IT SELLES CAME IN AND SO IS VERY CLEAR A SIDLIKE SELL THAT SLYING DORMENT SORT UPON THE OUTSIDE THE PERFERY OF THE FIBER WELL THEN GO IN IM INTO THE INTO THE FIBRA Y WI'LL TURN INTO AAMOUNT NEUCLA AND THEN IT CAN ACTUALLY NOW INCREASED YOUR DAMITER LIKE THAT AND SO THEN ACTUALLY IT WAS LIKE HAY YOUR CTUALY LIMITED BY THE AMOUNT OF THESE SIDLI SELLS YOU CAN GET IN INTER A NEWCLAN AND THEN THE EVIDENCE CAME OUT THO SHOWED HAY WHAT IF YOU DE TRAIN SOWHT UP I USED TO LIFT AWEIGHTS LIKE A LONG TIME AGO AND I GOT BIG BUT NOW LOST LOT OF MY MUSCLE IF I TRAIN AGAIN YOU ACTUALLY GET THAT MUSCLE BACK FASTER THEN IT TOOK YOU THE VERY FIRST TIME TO BUILD IT T THAT'S WHAT WE CALL MUSCLE MEMORY LIKE AN ARFEL NOW ON YOUR SIDE EQUASION MUSCLE MEMORYES SOMETHING DIFFER ITS IN RI WHENER YOU MINS IE ABOUT MUSCLE MEMORY  LIKE THE ABILITYARIDE TO BICYCLE AFTER SO MANY YEARS OF NOT HAVING I'VE TRIED TO RIDE ONE THAT'S I SUALLY LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE MUSCLE HAS SOMEBOTHY TO DO WITHTHES OSE AL THE INDEPENDED IT ITS IT'S BASICALLY A NERVOUS SYSTEM PHENOMENON NOT A PRERSENT A MUSCLE MEMORY HAS BEEN COOPTED BY DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES TO MEAN DIFFERENT THINGS YET EL AM ON OUR SIDE MUSCLE MEMORY IS GOING TO MEAN THAT ABILITY TO REMEMBER THAT MUSCLE SIZE RIHT THAT HYPERTRY BECAUSE AD YOU EXPLAINED THE MOTOR CONTROL THINGS THAT IT'S A TOTALLY A NERVE AS THE ONE I'LL GIVE YOU THIS ONE YOU GETS THE NERVE PEOPLE CAN HAVE THIS ONE WELL IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE ARE A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF PARALLELS BETWEEN STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHE CHANGES AND NERROW PLASTESY THIS IS COMING UP AGAIN AND AGAIN IN THIS CONVERSATION AM BECAUSE WE KNOW FOR INSTANCE THAT IF YOU ARE EXPOSED TO A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT LANGUAGES EARLY ON IN LIFE YOUWILL LEARN ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT LANGUAGES FAR MORE EASILY LATER IN LIFE OF COURSE THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S SOME CROSS OVER BETWEEN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES BUT OUR LATIN BASE LANGUAGES THAT 'L LA ALS FOR THAT THERE'S A SUB STRAIGHT FOR IT IT'S SIMILAR TO THE THE ABILITY TO LI ON A BICYCLE AGAIN PHENOMENON OR PLAYIN INSTRUMENT PHENOMENON BUT IT'S BROADER THAN THAT AND AGAIN I THINK THIS SPEAKS TO THE HUGE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ADAPTOR CHANGES THAT OCCURRING IN THE CELLS AND NERS THAT ENERATE THESE CELLS WHEN ONE EXPERIENCES INCREASES IN STRENGTH TE IBERTROPHY SO TO TO ROUND THAT OUT IM IN TA GO BACK TO OURSANTE WHAT WERE ACTUALLY LEARNING NOW IS THAT NEUCLEATION THING AND BY TH WAY THIS ENTIRE TRAJECTORY STORY IS PROBABLY OVER THE LAST LIKE EIGHT YEARS THIS IS HOW FAST WE'VE CHANGED OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW MUSCLE GROWS  THE SARCOPOSAN WERE TIKIN AM THING FIVE YEARS AGO IS WAS BRO SINES NOW IT'S ITS PREYWELLESTABLISH THE MONUCLATION THING AS AINT TO TEN YEARS AGO IT'S CHANGING EVERY WEEK THIS PAPER WE JUST SUBMITTED THIS WEEK SHOWED ACTUALLY IWHY WE HAD GENERALLY THOUGHT A FEW YEARS AGO IN FACT YOU CAN FIND ME ON PODCASTS AND PROBABLY IN SOME OF MIVIDIOS TALKING ABOUT THIS AND I'M N I TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THOSE THINGS ARE WRONG LIKE WE'VE JUST HAD NEW THINGS COME OUT IS OSCOA YEARS WHERE THAT DETRAINING OF FACT WE THOUGHT WAS A REASON OF WHEL WHAT HAPPENS IS IF YOU HAD THE MUSCLE BEFORE AND YOU'VE BROUGHT IN THESE NEUCLEI ANDTHY DIFFERENTIATED AND TURNING TO INTOENUCLEN AND THEN THE MUSCLE GOT SMALL AGAIN YOU PRESERVE THOSE NEUCLEI AND THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU GOT A TRAIN AGAIN THEY WERE ALREADY AROUND SO THE MUSCLE GROWS FASTER THE SECOND TIME THAT DID THE FIRST WHELE NOW THIT LOOKS LIKE THAT'SACTIOLY NOT THE CASE IN FACT IT'S ACTUALLY PROBABLY HAP WAS HAPPENING IS IT'S A IT'S A EPIGENETIC CHANGE IIN THE NECLEASABILITY TO ACTESS THE DEAN A NEEDED TO GROW MUSCLE IT'S EFFECTIVELY THE ANALOGY WE USED IT'S THE NEUCLI IRE REMEMBERING HOW TO WRITE A BITE SO IT'S QUITE FUNNY TAT YOU SAID THAT BECAUSE IT'S NOT REALLY NECESSARILY THAT THE'RE BEING PRESERVED OFR TIME THERE THEY HAVE LEARNED THE SEQUENCE IT TAKES TO GROW APPROACHING THERE AND IT GOES IT HAPPENS FASTER THE SECOND TIME AND WE'VE ALSO LEARNED THAT THERE ARE SPECIFIC NEUCLA WE'VE KNON THIS FORACTORY A WHILE WEVE FOUND US OUR LAB AR WE DN'T DISCOVER IT WE JUSTWE SAW THIS AND AND OUR SOME OFR IVERS BUT THERE ARE DIFFERENT SHAPES THE NECLI SOME ARE MORE OVAL SOME OR MORE LONGATED AND THE SHAPE DETERMINES THE LOT OF THE FUNCTION SOME OF EM ARE HANGING OUT MORE TOWARDS A PERFERY IN SOME OF EM ERE HANGING OUT RIGHT AROUND THE NEUCLEAS WELL IT LOOKS LIKE THES ACTUALLY PROBABLY DIFFERENT TYPES OF NEUCLEI I'MA LOT OF EM THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO THE MATTEL CONDRIA I'M FACT YOU TO SEE TAKE ON SOME OF THE IMAGING WE HAVE WE JUST LIKE THE'RE JUST PACKED AROUND THE THE MA THE MITAL CONDRY AND THERERE SOME THAT ARE PROABLY SPECIFIC TO INJURY REPAIR AND SO THIS IS PROBABLY EXPLAINING A LOTTY THE INDIVIDUAL VARIATION I MANE I KNOW YOUH YOU SAID PREVIOUSLY TIKE YOU'RE JUST A VERY YOU'RE VERY SLOW IT RECOVERIN THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT GOIN TO THAT AND I WOULD I WOULD LOVE TO WALK THROUGH SORT OF ALL THE BUCKETS IWE MAYBE LATER AN INTO RECOVERY BUT ONE OF THE INHERENT GENETIC VARIATIONS IS COULD BE SIMPLY THAT YOU MAY BE HAVE MORE ORE LESS THE NEUCLA RESPONSIBLE FOR TISSU REPAIR I THAT' SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING THE LAST LIKE HANDFUL OF MONTHS THAT'S BEEN COMING OUT WE'LL SEE IF THAT HOLDS UP IS TRUE OR NOT I'M SO AS WE'RE LEARNING MORE AND MORE ALMOST EVERY DAY ABOUT MUSCLE PHYSIOLOGY WHAT'S SUPERFON AND INTERESTING AND I THNT THE MOST EXCITING WHAT TO DO AND DURANCE AN TURNS OF LIKE HAT OF TRAIN AND HOW TO EAT AND HOW TO DO RTHING ELSE TAKE GET THESE ADOPTATIONS HAS BEEN PRETTY WELL ESTABLISHED FOR A LONG LONG LONG TIME WE'RE JUST FIGURING OUT HOW LIKE WHAT'S HAPPING IN THE MUSCLE NOW BUT WE KNOW WHAT TO DO SO FROM A PRACTICAL STAND POINT PRETTY TOGETHER PROTOCALLS FOR ANY OUTCOME THAT YOU WANT OR DON'T WANT FOR ANY MOTALITY YOU DON'T HAVE A GIEM YOU HAVE WAIT YOU HAVE DUMBELLS ONLY YOU ONLY HAVE CUTTLE BELLS YOU DON'T WANT O IT YOU ONLY USE BODYWAY WE CAN YOU ONLY AVE THREE DAYS WEEK YOU HAVE SEVENDAYS A WEEK YOU WANT A MAXIMIS MUSCLE GROWTH YOU WANT TO GET A LITTLE BIT STRONGER ANY THESE VARIABLES YOU WANT THROUGHOUT ME WE HAVE A LARGE EVIDENCE BASE FOR EXACTLY HW TO GET THOSE ADAPTATIONS AND NOT OTHERS SO WHILE WE HAVE A LOT TO LEARN ABOUT THE MECHANISMS AN THE PHYSIOLOGY WE HAVE PRETTYGOOD LEGS TO STAND ON TERMS O WANT TO DO TO GET WHATEVER ADAPTATIONS YOU WANT SO WHAT ARE THE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF AN EFFECTIVE STRENGTH AND HYPERTRIPHY PROTOCAL OH  SO WHAT EVER LIKE TO ACTUALLY DO IS IS WALKING THROUGH BOTH OF THOSE BECAUSE AS WE MENTION BEFORE THEY OVERLAP BUT THE TRAINING NEEDS TO BE DIFFERENTIATED SO THAT YOU CAN OPTIMIZE EITHER STRENGTH HY PERTRIPHE OR IF YOU ACTUALY WANT YOU AN GET ACCOMMINATION OBOTH THIS A LOWS YOU TO THEN GET THE ADIPTATION YOU WANT AVOID ONCES YOU DON'T WANT AND THEN GET EVEN ACCOMBINATION IF THAT'S THE PREFERENCE SO YOU' LOT OF PEOPLE TO TALK ABOUT I WANT TO GET A LITTLE STRONGER I ON ADDS SOME MUSCLE THAT'S A DIFFERENT ANSWER THAN SOMEONEWHO WANTS THE TRULY MAXIMISE MUSCLE WHICH IS A DIFFERENT ANSWER FROM SOMEBODY WIN MAXIMISE'S ONCEE MAX MY STRENGTH WHICH IS A DIFFERENT ANSWER FROM SOMEBODY WANCE SO MAX MY STRENGTH BUT NOT ACTUAGAIN MUSCLES SO WE HAVE ALL THESE COMBINATIONS WHAT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND BEFORE WE GET INTO TOE DETAILS IS A COUPLE OF THINGS NUMBER ONE WE WEVE BEEN TEASING THIS CONCEPT SO FAR ATHE CONCEPTS ARE FEW BUT THE METHODS ARE MANY AND SO I WANT TO HIT THOSE CONCEPTS ARIGHT NOW THESE ARE AS YOU AS YOU SAY TESE ARE THE NON NEGOTIABLES THAT HALF TO HAPPEN IN ANY TRAINING PROGRAM AND AND I'M A REFERRING THESE IN THE STRENGTH AN I BRTO BE CONVERSATION BUT THESE ARE TRUE OF POWER DEVELOPMENTS BE DEVELOPMENT MUST GT ENDURENCE ENDURANCE ANY OTHER THING THESE ARE THINGS ARE JUST HALF TO HAPPEN FOR ANY TRAINING PROGRAME TO WORK I MENTIONED ONE AA LITTLE BITERLY WHICH WAS ADHERENTS AND SO THE MY FREQUENT COLLABRATOR DAN GARNER WILL CONSTANTLY SAY CONSISTENCY BEATS INTENSITY AGAIN IN FACT THE LITERATURE WILL SHOW YOU VERY CLEARLY INHERENCE IT IS A NUMBER IN PREDICTOR OF PHYSICAL FITNESS OUTCOME SO WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING THAT YOU WILL ENGAGE IN WILL YOU'LL PUT EFFORT INTO N YOU'LL B ABLE TO REPEAT TISSISSINLOVERYTIME SO THAT'S NUBER ONE THE SECOND ONE IS AND THIS IS A MAJOR REASON THAT PEOPLE DON'T HIT THEIR FITNESS CALS IN FACT I WOULD ARGUE OUTSIDE OF NOT DOING IT THE NUMBER ONE MISTAKE THEY MAKE IS PROGRESSIVE OVERLOOKED SO MIN TO WALK YOU THROUGH EXACTLY HOW MUCH YOU SHOULD BE INCREASING YOURESEPTS AND RA PS IN WAIT ET CETERA A PERWEEK PERMONTH I LATER BUT THAT'S THE BIGGEST THING YOU HAVE GOT TO HAVE SOME SORT OF OVERLOAD THE BODY WORKS AS AN ADAPTATION MECHANISM RANG SO IN FACT WE TALKED PREVIOUSLY ABOUT THE HARVOR FATIGLAB AND ONE OF THINGS ACTUALLY PEOPLE TOT REALIZE IS THE CONCEPT OF HOME OSTACES IS ACTUALLY COMES FROM RESEARCH OF THE HARBOR FATIGLAB IT WAS A WORK THAT THEY DID ON AN ENDURANCE RUNNER I FORGET HIS NAME AND THET SORT OF REALIZE THAT AFTER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME WORKING OUM  THIS IS AN ACU EXERCISE ABOUT THE BODY ACTUALLY COMES BACK TO SOME STABLE PLACE DESPITE THE FACT HE WAS CONTINUE TO WORK AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT BORE THE PHRASE STEADY STATE AND THAT ACTUALLY THEN THEY LAUNCH OFFICE A WHILE THERE'S THE STATE THAT THE BODY ONCES TO BEIN AND WE'LL CALL THIS HOMEO STACIS SO THAT WILL THOSE ALL CONSCEPT CAME OUT OF EXCESS PHYSIOLOGY WHICH IS REALLY REALLY COOL RIGHT  WE DON'T GET A LOT OF LOVE LOT OF SIME SCIENTIFICALLY BUT THAT'S A GOOD ONE THAT WE TOK SO WIVE OUT ALL MATTERS IS WE HAVE GOT TO ACHIEVE SOME SORT OF OVERLOAD WITHOUT A GOING EXCESS SO WE'LL COVER THAT LATER OF EXACTLY WHAT TO DO ANDGEPPETENTUALLY GETTING OVERTRAINING AND MONNERING AND MATTERING THINGS LIKE THAT BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF CONSISTENT PREDICTABLE OVERLOAD THAT'S WHAT'S GON TO CAUSE ADAPTATION INTO CONTINUE T COSTRASS IF YOU DON'T DO THAT YOU CAN STILL DO THINGS LIKE BURN CALORIES YOU CAN STILL GET SOME OFTHE OTHER BENEFITS OF EXERCISE LIKE IMPROVED MOOD COGNAI FUNCTIONN ITS SCETERA SET AFLEXIBILITY INCREASE IS ALL THOSE CAN HAPPEN WITHOUT A PROGRESSIVE OVERLOW BUT IF YOU WANT TO SEE THESE GAINS AN STRENGTH AND I PERTROPHY YOU REALLY NEED TO IM PROGRSSIVE OVERLOOW THAT'S CONSEPTNEMVER TO A THE THIRD ONE HERE IT IS GOING TO BE INDIVIDUALIZATION AND THIS IS GOING MAKING GET INTO THINGS LIKE PERSONAL PREFERENCE IN EQUIPMENT OVAILABILITY YOU HAVE KETTLEBELLS OR DUMBELLS R YOU ONLY HAVE BANDS WE HAVE NONE THAT ITHESE ARE ALL SMALLER DETAILS BUT THAT'S AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT A TO IT THE LAST ONE I REALLY WANT TO GET INTO IS PICKING THE APPROPRIATE TARGET AND WE WENT THROUGH THIS WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT THE FITNESS PROTOCAL AND IF YOU RUN THROUGH SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND YOU RUN SOME TESTING IN FIGURE OUT WHERE YOUR BIGGEST LIMITATIONS ARE THAT'S GON O HELP YOU IDENTIFYING WHERE YOU NEED TO GO IM SO IF YOU CAN DO ALL THOSE THINGS YOURE GOING TO BE INTO GOOD SPOT TO BALANCE SPECIFICITY AND VARIATION RIGHT SO IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU GROW YOUR BICEPS YOU BETTER MAKE SURE YOUR BICEPS ARE WORKING HAVING SAID THAT IF YOU OVER RELY ON SPECIFICITY YOU'RE GOING TO INCREASE THE LIKELIHOD OF OVER U CENJURIES WHICH IS GOING TO COME BACK AND ACTUALLY HAMPER CONSSISTENCY OVER TIME ALL RIGHT SO THIS IS WHEN HEDGING TOWARD SPECIFICITIES IMPORTANT BUT TOO MUCH CAN CAUSE A PROB IF YOU GO THE OTHER DIRECTION AND YOU GO TOO MUCH VARIATION SO IMAGING YOU'E A SORT OF DOING ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT EXERCISES EVERY TIME YOU YOU WORK OUT THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT ENOUGH STIMULYING DIRECTLY ON THE MUSCLE OR MUSCLE GROUPS OR MOVEMENT PATTERN IF YOU'RE WANTING TO LEARN A NEW MOVEMENT TO GET YOU VERY FAR AND SO THIS IS A CLASSIC PROBLEM OF I'M DOING A LOT OF WORK BUT I DON'T H AVE A VERY CLEAR DIRECTION I LACK SPECIFICITY SO I'M WORKING BUT I'M NOT SEEING A LOT OF IMPROVEMENTS AND THIS IS LIKE IN THE BUSINESS WORLDS ECETERA THIS IS LIKE DOING A WHOLE ONT TO DIFFEREN THINGS MEAN YOU GET NOTHING REALLY DONE SO THAT'S THE GAME OR TO PLAYHERE RIGHT HOW DO WE OVERLOAD THE STUFF HOW DO WE MAKE SURE BALANCING SPECIFICITY AND VARIATION HOWDO WE MAKE SURE I WANT TO DO THIS AND THEN HOW DO I INDIVIDUALIZE IT FROM MY NEEDS AND CIRCUMSTANCES AND AND MOVEMENT RESTRICTIONS AND TIME OFILABILITY AND MY CALENDAR AND DESIRES IN ALL THESE THINGS SO THOSE THE CONSEPTS WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO HIT THE METHODS THAT WE CHOOSE RUN ACROSS A HANDFUL OF VARIABLES AND WE CALL THESE THINGS MODIFIABLE VARIABLES BECAUSE AS YOU MODIFY THEM OR YOU MAKE DIFFERENT CHOICES WITHIN THESE VARIABLES YOU GET DIFFERENT OUTCOMES ARE ADAPTATIONS THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT DETERMINES THE NIN ADAPTATIONS S WE THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SO THE WAY THAT I LIKE TO SAY THIS IS EXERCISES DO NOT DETERMINE ADAPTATION SO YOU CAN'T SIMPLY GO I WANT TO GET STRONGER THEREFORE I'M GOING TO CHOOSE THESE EXERCISES THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS WHAT DETERMINES THADAPTATION IS THE EXECUTION OF THE EXERCISES SO A DEADLIFT IS MY FAVORITE EXAMPLE A DEADLIFT IS A COMMON A EXAMPLE THAT PEOPLE THINK OF WHEN THEY WANT TO CHOOSE A LOWER BODY STRENGTH EXERCISE BUT A DEADLIFT WILL NOT INCREASE YOUR STRENGTH UNLESS YOU'RE EXECUTING IT IN THE PROPER FASHION A NONLY TALKING ABOUT TECHNIQUERE I'M TALKING ABOUT THESE MODIFIABLE VARIABLES THE SAME THING FOR POWER EXERCISES WE'LL COMMONLYSE THEE MISTAKES OF DOING A ACTIVITIES LIKE A BOXJUMP WHICH IS GREAT PEOPLE THINK OH I MON TO GET IMPROVE MY POWER WHICH WE KNOW IS EXTREMELY HIGHLY CORRELATED TO A ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING AND PARTICULARLY LIVING UNASSISTED AS YOU AGE RIGHT IIS REDUCTION O POWER SO THEY'LL DO IN ACT TIVEY LIKE A BOXJUM WHAT THEYRE FAILING TO REALIZES UNLESS YOU DO IT POWERFULLY YOU WON'T ACTUALLY INCREASE POWER IF YOU DON'T MOVE FAST YOU WON'T GET FASTER SO THE THE THE WAY THAT WE MANIPULATE THESE VARIABLES IS EVERYTHING TO DETERMINING THE ADAPTATION YOU GET OR AGAIN DON'T GET SO WITH THAT FOUNDATION I THINK WE CAN CINDTO RUN RIGHT INTO THESE THINGS AND WE CAN START OFF WITH PERHAPS BEEDEN POWER AND WHAT O WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS WALK YOU THROUGH ALL THOSE MODIFIABLE VARIABLES WHAT TO DO WITH THEM AND THEN HIT YOU WITH AS MANY DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES AS AS WE REALLY HAVE TIME FOR AND THEN WE MOVE ON TO STRENGTH AND I PERTROPE AND COT AROUND THE ENTIRE THING OUT AND THEN MAY BE AT THE END WE CAN TALK SOME OTHER VARIABLES LIKE WHAT HAPPENS IF A I HAVE A TRAINING PROTO CALL AND I'M HALF WAY THROGH IT I CAN'T FINISH MY WORK OUT WHAT SHOULD I DO REDUCE MY WEIGHT OR PRODUCE MY DURATION OR THINGS LIKE THAT SO THERE'S LOTS OF WOOD IF SENARIALS WE CAN GO THROUGH THE PETENTIALLY A A LOT OF PEOPLE LISTENING HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT SO SOND LIKE A PLAN SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN I LIKE TO TAKE A BRIEF BRATE TO ACKNOWLEDGE OURESPONSER INSIDE TRACKER INSIDE TRACKER IS A PERSONALIZED NUTRUTIAN PLATFORM THAT ANALIZES DATA FROM YOUR BLOOD INDIAN AY TO HELP YOU BETTER UNDERSTAND YOUR BODY AND HELP YOU REACH YOUR HEALTH GOALS I'VE LONG BEEN A BELIEVER IN GETTING REGULAR BLOOD WORK DONE FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT MANY OF THE FACTORS THAT IMPACT YOUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM HEALTH AND WELL BEING CAN ONLY BE ANALYZED FROM A QUALITY BLOOD TEST ONE ISSUE WITH A LOT OF BLOOD TASTANTY ANATES US OUT THERE HOWEVER IS THAT YOU GET INFORMATION BACK ABOUT VARIOUS LEVELS OF LIPIDS AND HORMONES AN METABOLIC FACTORS ET CETERA BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THAT INFORMATION INSIDE TRACKOR MAKES KNOWING WHAT TO DO WITH ALL THAT INFORMATION EXCEEDINGLY EASY THEY HAVE A PERSONALIZED PLATFORM THAT LETS YOU SEE WHAT YOUR SIPISS IC NUMBERS ARE OF COURSE BUT THEN ALSO WHAT SORTS OF BEHAVIOUR OLD DUES AND DONTES WHAT SORTS OF NUTRITIONAL CHANGES WHAT SORTS OF SUPPLEMENTATION WOULD ALLOW YOU TO BRING THOSE LEVELS INTO THE RANGES THAT ARE OPTIMOL FOR YOU IF YOU LIKE TO TRY INSIDE TRACOR YOU CAN VISIT INSIDE TRACOR DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET TWENTY PER SCENT OFF ANY OF INSIDE TRACTORS PLANS AGAIN THAT'S INSIDE TRACKOR DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET TWENTY PER CENT OFF SO JUST INTERRUPT BRIEFLY AND MAKE SURE THAT I AND EVERYBODY ELSE HAVE IN MIND THE PROPER NINE ADAPTATIONS THAT WE'V BEEN REFERRING TO IN THAT WE'RE DISCUSSED IN DETAIL IN EPISODE ONE I HAVE LISTED NUMBER ONE SKILL IN TECHNIQUE NUMBER TO SPEED NUMBER THREE POWER WHICH IS SPEED TIMES FORCE NUER FOUR STRENGTH NUMBER FIVE HYPERTROPHY NUMBER SIX MUSCULAR ENDURANCE NUMBER SEVEN AN AROIC CAPACITY NUMBER EIGHT MAXIMAL EROBIC CAPACITY AN NUBER NINE LONG DERATION STEADY STATE EXERCISE YET YOU NAIL THO THANK YOU FOR FOR THAT IS PROBABLY IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION FOR EVERYBODY ISO THAT BEING SAID LET TUS JUMP RIGHT IN TO TO SPEED AND POWER NOW ALL DO THESE A LITTLE BIT SIMULTANEOUSLY THEY ARE DIFFERENT IF YOUARE A HIGH PERFORMANCE ATLY YOU REALLY NEED TO SEPARATE THESE TWO THINGS FORTHE MOST PEOPLE THOUGH WE CAN PROBABLY THINK ABOUT THEM IS IS THE SAME THING THERE'S NOT A LOT OF PURE SPEED TRAINING THAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC IS IS SINTERES TED IN  IF YOU ON ACTUALLY FORTHER BREAK DOWN SWE THEIRE MULTIPLE COMPONENTS THERE'S EXCELERATION THERE'S TOPIN VELOCITY THERE'S CHANGE OF DIRECTION OR AGILITING THINGS LIKE THAT SO WI'LL DIS KIND OF CALL F ALL THAT SPEED AND POWER OR NOW NOW AT THE ONSET THERE'S THIS THREE TO FIVE CONSEPT THATTHAT WE TALKE ABOUT MANY TIMES WHERE THIS IS REALLY FAIRLY TRUE FOR SPEED POWER OR STRENGTH NOW I I DIDN'T DEVELOP THE THREE TO FIVE IS JUST AN EASY WAY TO HELP YOU REMEMBER ONE CONSEPT THAT WILL RUN TRUE ACROSS ALL THESE SANG SO THREE TO FIVE IT REFERS TO THREE TO FIVE DAYS PER WEEK I PICK THREE TO FIVE EXERCISES AND YOU'RE GING TO DO THREE TO FIVE REPETITIONS PER SET YOU'LL DO THREE TO FIVE SETS AND YOU'LL REST THREE TO FIVE MINUTES BETWEEN EACH SET IF YOU DO THAT AND YOU EXECUTE ANY OF THE EXERCISES YOU CUSE AT A HIGH IN TENT AND THAT PART IS CRITICAL YOU DON'T GET FASTER BY MOVING KIND OF FAST YOU CAN'T IMPROVE POWER BY MOVING LIKE AND POWERFULLY YOU HAVE TO BE TRYING REGARDLESS OF WHEATHER ACTION MOVING FASTER OR NOT ANY TIME YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SPEED OR POWER YOU'RE BY DEFINITION USING SUB MAXIMAL WEIGHTS SO YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO LIFT IT THAT'S NOT THE QUESTION THE QUESTION IS HOW FAST CAN YOU LIFT THAT IMPLEMENT AND SO INTENTION IS INCREDIBLE IMPORTANT SO IF YOU DO THAT THE SAME FOR STRENGTH BY THE WAY SO IF YOU LAND ON THAT THAT ALLOWS YOU TO RUN THE GAMIT FROM AS LITTLE AS THREE DAYS A WEEK YOU'RE DOING A THREE EXERCISES YOU DO THREE SETS OF THREE WHICH IS A VERY VERY LOW VOLUME IT'S A A VERY LOW AMOUNT OF DAYS EASY TO HANDLE ALL THE WAY TO FIVE SET O FIVE OF FIVE EXERCISES FIVE DAYS WEK SO IT I IT'S AGAIN AS IT JUST ONE SAMPLE THAT'S SOMETHING EASY TO REMEMBER AND IS QUITE EFFECTIVE FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND THIS HAS BEEN TET'S TO QUITE EXTENSIBELY AND IN BOTH THE COACHING ROUNDS AS WELL AS THE SCIENTIFIC ROUNDS TO BE I'M QUITE PRODUCTIVE AND AND EASY TO FOLLOW AND GRASP IF YOU DO THAT ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS SLIGHTLY INCREASE THE LOAD OR THE VOLUME BUT MOSTLY THE LOAD OVER TIME AND THE NUMBER WE WANT TO LOOK FOR THERE IS SOMETHING LIKE A THREE TO FIVE PER CENT INCREASE PER WEEK SO THAN EXAMPLE WOULD BE IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO AN EXERCISE AT A HUNDRED POUNDS YOU CAN'T NECESSARILY JUST ADD FIVE POUNDS EVERY WEEK THAT'S GON CONTEFT YOU PRETTY QUICKLY AND SO YOU MAY HAVE TO RUN SOME A SMALLER INCREMENT IF YOURE DOING LIKE A LOWER BODY EXERCISE WHERE YOU MIGHT HAVE A COUPLE OF HUNDRED POUNDS ON THE WEIGHT YOU CAN PROBABLY GET AWAY WITH OUTING FIVE POUNDS COULD STILL LAY A LOWL PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL LOAD SO THAT'S ROUGHLY THE GUIDE THAT WE WANT TO GET TO FOR SPEED POWER AND STRENGTH SO THAT SOUNDS INCREDIBLY SIMPLE AND EFFECTIVE YET I HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS R FIRST ALL IF SOMEBODY IS USING THE THREE TO FIVE APPROACH DOES THAT MEAN THEY SHOULD NOT BE DOING ANY OTHER WEIGHT TRAINING OF ANY KIND IN THOSE WORK OUTS OR AT ALL NO YOU YOU CAN CERTAINLY DO THAT INCOMBINATION WITH ANYTHING ELSE YOU WOULD LIKE ESPECIALLY IF YOU THINK ABOUT SPEED IN POWER THOSE ARE VERY NON FATIGUING AND SO IF YOU COULND IMAGINE A YOU'R GOING TO GO TO THE BEACH AND YOU'RE TO TAKE A TEN POUND TO TWENTY POUND MEDICINE BALL WITH YOU AND YOURE GING TO DO I FOUR DIFFERENT EXERCISES WERE YOU'RE THROWING THE MEDICINE BALL AS HIGH AS YOU CAN IN THE AIR FOUR TIMES IN ROW TAKING A BREAK AND YOU TWO OR THREE THAT'S THAT YOU DO MAY BE THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT TYPES OF THROWS THAT'S VERY GOOD FOR IMPROVING POWER EXTREMELY GOOD BUT IT'S NOT VERY FATIGUING SEE YOU COULD CERTAINLY FINISH THAT WORK OUT IN TWENTY MINUTES AND THEN RUN ON AND THEN DO ANY NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS S EYOU COULD DOE M SOME HIGH INTENSITY AND A ROBE A CAPACITY WORK YOU CUL DO STEADY STAYESOF YOU COULD YOU COUND EVEN DO HYPERTROPHY ON TOP WOF THAT SO THRE'S M THERE'S A TWO MADE YOUR CATEGORIES OF WHAT WE CALL PUARTIZATION THERE'S THERE'S MANY MANY MANY OF THEM BUT THE TWO THAT HAVE THE MOST SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE ARE WHAT'S CALL LINEAR PERITIZATION AND ANOTHER IS CALLED UNDULATING AR OFTEN DAILY UNDULATING PERTERSATIO AND I'M FLAGGING THESE TO AGAIN DESPITE THE FACT THE ARE MANY MANY MENY MORE BECAUSE THEY REPRESENT TWO DIFFERENT CONCEPTS WHEN YOU' D ACTURY TIS TOUCH UPON IT SO LINEARPARTIZATION AS A HALL MARKED BY BASIY SAYING WE'RE GOING TO TRAIN ONE ADAPTATION AT A TIME SO IMAGINE GOING SIX SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS AND YOU'R ONLY DOING STRENGTH OR YOU'RE ONLY DOING HYPERTROPY YOR INDURNS FOR THAT MATTER SO IN THAT PARTICULAR CAYS YOU YOU WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING ELSE IN COMMIDATION IF YOU CONTRAST THAT TO UNDULATING PEARTIZATION YOU WOULD ACTUALLY BE DOING MULTIPL DIFFERENT STYLES OF TRAINING EVE WUL EITHER WITHIN THE SAME DAY OR JUST DIFFERENT DAYS SO COULD BE MONDAY'S POWER WEDNESDAYIS STRENGTH FRIDAYIS HYPERTROPHY WHATEVER OR COULD BE A LITTLE BIT OF STRENGTH EVERY SINGLE DAY A LITTLE BUT I PERTURE EVERYDAY LITTLE BIT OF POWER EVERY DAY AND YOU WOULD JUST CHANGE THE AMOUNT OF EACH THAT YOU DO WITHIN THE DAY TO ALTER THE EMPHASIS RIGHT NOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE STUDIES AN THERE HAVE BEEN MANY A ARCEETIS ON US THE RESULT OF BOTH OF THESE TRAING PROGRAMS IS GENERALLY BASICLY THE SAME THING THEY ARE EQUALLY EFFECTIVE HERE IS THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE THOUGH ONE IF YOURE GOAL IS VERY SPECIFIC TO ONE OUTCOME YOU WANT A HEADE TOWARD SPECIFICITY SO IF YOU'RE LIKE HA I'M TRYING TO MAX A MINES THE AMOUNT OF MOSS LIKE CAN BUILD IN THE NEXT SAIGHT WEEKS THEN YOU DON'T REALLY ANYTHING ELSE BESIDES THAT IS JUST DISTRACTION AND POTENTIAL INTERFERENCE DOES IT REALLY MATTER OR NOT DE MATTER BUT IT'S NOT HELPING ANYTHING ELSE SO LINEAR PEARTIZATION IS IS FUNDAMENTAL AN PROVIDING FOCUS AND THEREFORE THE THE ADAPTATIONS TEN TO BEE A OFTEN TIMES LARGER INAT SPECIFIC ARET THAT DOWNSIDE IS YOU NOW GO SIX TO EIGHT THE TEN WEEKS OF DOING NOTHING ELSE AND SO YOU WERE LOSING THOSE OTHER ADAPTATIONS AT A GREAT AT A FASTOR RATE AND YOU CAN IMAGINE DOING SOMETHING LIKE SPEED WORK ONLY AGAIN SPEED WORK BY DEFINITION IS NON FATIGUING SO WHEN OFTEN TIMES WE DHING A SPEED WORK IS LIKE ALL I DID LATTER DRILLS AND I DID NALL THESE THINGS AN LIKE I THREW UP AT THE END DUT THAT'S NOT SPEED WORK YOU JUST DID A DIFFERENT TYPE OF ANDURANCE TRAINI IT WHICH IS GREAT AN IMPORTANT SO TRUE SPEED WORK IS VERY HIGH REST VERY LOW FATIGUE AND ACTUALLY TRULY TRYING TO REACH A NEW LEVEL OF SPEED OR VELOCITY SO NON FATIGUING IF YOU DID THAT EXCLUSIVELY FOR TEN WEEKS YOU WOULD BE PRETTY UNFIT BY THE END OF IT COULD YOU DID YOU WOULD ALSO LOSE THESE SANMONOMUSCELE MASS NOT BECAUSE THERE'S AN INTERFERENCE EFFECT BUT SIMPLY BECASE THE FACT YOU HAVE NOT SIMULATED MUSCLE GROWTH FOR EIGHT O TEN WEEKS AND SO NEITHER ONE OF THESE IS BETTER THEN THE OTHER WEREN'N'T SEE THIS CLASSICALLY ACROSS ALL A PROGRAME DESIGN OR PEARTIZATION STRATEGIES IS IT'S JUST A IT TO GIVE AND TAKE THERE ARE TONS OF DIFFERENT SYSTEMS AND AND PERHAPS AT THE END WE CAN TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE MORE ADVANCE PRATIZATION STYLES ON THESE ONES ARE ARE AR BOTH EFFACTIVE A YOU COUL DO THESE WITH BEGINNERS YOU COULD DO THESE WITH ADVANCED ATLETES YOUCULD DO THEM AN INSPECTOR BUT THE'R THER SOME OF THE MORE WELL DOCUMENT OF ONE IT'S JUST A PRO AN CONGAME WRATS IT'S WHAT YOU WILLING TO GIVE UP THE WAYTHY YOU SOLVED THAT PROBLEM IS GOING BACK TO THAT FITNESS O SESSMAN AND YOU'RE ANALYSIS AND REALLY TRULY UNDER STANDING WHAT YOUR GOALD IS IS YOU'R GOALD TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF STRENGTH THAN A LITTLE ABOUT AT OKA GRAT MAYBE UNDULATED PERTIZATION IS IN APPROACH IF YOU'R GOALD IS REALLY TO MAX  MY STRENGTH AND MAYBE YOU CAN WAIT ON PUTTING SOME AS SOME MASS ON MAYBE LINEAR PEARIZATION IS A BETTER A PORCH OR ANOTHER STYLE APPEARSATION THAT'S OPPL FOR STRAINTING SO IT'S SIMPLY ABOUT ADDRESSING YOU THINGS ONEOF THE MAJOR PROBLEMS FOLKS HAVE IN ADDITION TO LOCKING PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD S THEY DON'T HAVE ANY FORESIGHT PAST THE NEXT DAY OF THE TRAINING AND SO IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU SET OFF BLOCKS THAT ARE ANYWHERE BETWEEN SIX TO TWELVE WEEKS LONG WER YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THE SPECIFIC PLAN IDEALLY YOU HAVE AN IDEA FOR THE WHOLE YEAR I ACTUALLY HAVE LIKE A A DE STRUCTURACT LOCKY THROUGH A FOR THAT BUT EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT REALLY THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT THEN NEXT WELVE WEEKS AND THEN MAYBE NEXT TWELVE WEKS AFTER THAT AND THAT'S GOINGTO GIV YOU LOT OF GUIDANCE ABOUT WHAT TO DO AND WHAT TO FOCUS ON TERRIFIC WHAT ABOUT WARMING UP I WAS TAUGHT THAT ONE SHOULD DO HIGHER REPETITION MOVEMENTS WITH LIGHTER WEIGHTS IN ORDER TO WARM UP AND THEN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DID MAKE A BIG POSITIVE DIFFERENCE FOR ME IN TERMS OF STRENGTH AND HYPERTO RETRAINING WAS TO DO A A MODERATE REPETITION WARM UP WITH A FAIRLY LIGHT WEIGHT BUT THEN TO ACTUALLY KEEP THE NUMBER OF WARM UP REPETITIONS FAIRLY LOW AND WORK PROGRESSIVELY TOWARD THE FIRST SO CALLD WORK SET WHEN YOU SAY THREE TO FIVE THAT'S THREE TO FIVE WORK SETS CORRECT YET AR YOU ALSO CAN TELL ME THREE TO FIVE WARM UPS NO I YOU ALSO CAN TELL ME THIT HAS TO BE DONE BETWEEN THREE AND FIVE F M ASO I TERMS OEVRYDOIS FRIENDS IN ALL SERIOUSNESS A WHAT DOES I A GOOD WARM UP LOOK LIKE YE AND I REALIZE THIS WILL VERY DEPENDING ON HOW COOL YOUR TRAINING ENVIRONMENT IS TIME OF DAY ET CETERA BUT AS IT GOT OF UMBRELLA FOR A GOOD WARM UP O GE WHAT SHOULD PEOPLE DO THE YOU'VE ALREADY SORT TO JUMPE THE GUN WITH  MY ANSWER IT  IS HONESTLY VERY DEPENDENT UPON THE PERSON SO SOME FOLKS RESPOND VERY WELL TO A MENIMA WAR UP OTHERS I'VE HAD LOSS OF ACTUALLY O PROFESSIONAL FIGHTERS IAVE WORKED MITH WHERE THE ACTUALY HAE A AJORELY BASEMALT PLAYER RIGHT NOW HE'S ONE O THE BEST PICTURE O PICTURES IN THE GAME PROBABLY THE BEST AND THE LONGER WE WARM UP THE BETTER HIS NUMBERSGET WE ACTUALY TO A VIRTICAL JUMP TESSHE'S GETTO KILL ME CAUSE HE GET SO MAD I WANTED TO SEE HOW LONG IT SORT OF TOOK HIM TO REACH A PEAQUE VERTICAL JUMP AND MOST TIMES THIS TAKES PEOPLE SOMETHING LIKE FIVE TO TEN SORT OF REPS AND I SAID TAKE IT UP ALL THE WAY TO A MAXIM OF VIRTICAL JUMP AND THEN WHAT WANT YOU TO IS CONTINUE TO JUMPING AND TELL YOU HAVE THREE CONSECUTIVE JUMS OR YOU'RE DOWN LOWER THA NINETY PER SENT AND SO I WWHAT WE WERE TRYING TO LOOK AT HIS SORT OF WIN IS HE GEN A BRAK CAUSE IN BASEBALL HE'S NOT THROW LIKE A HUNDRED PICTURES O SO OR TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WIN IS HIS PEAQUE VELOCITY ON IS FAST MALKIN TA DROP AND SORT OF BASIS CONDITIONING ON THAT T'S A DIFFRENT STYLE OF C DITION GET'S POWER ENDURANCE IS REALY WHAT T IS A HE CALLED ME IN THE MIDDLE OF IT O LIE O DONE WHATEVER NES IS LIKE NO LIKE HOW MANY THESE MESS WAS TO DO AND ALS TE QUEYTOCAMES LIKE I'MONREP A HUNDRED AND THIRTY OR SOMETHING AND I WAS LIKE WHAT  WHAT REPT DID YOU PEIK ON HE PIKED ON RUP SEVENTY SOMETHING LIKE THAT SIXTY NINE I THINK TECHNICALLY IS HE SCOOFY A SO HE'S A CLASS EXAMPLE OV WORK IN FOR MANY MANY YEARS WE HAVE A TON OF DATA ON HIM A TON OF BIOLOGICAL DATA A TON OF A NERLMOSCULARSEF  LIKE ALL KINDS OF STUFF AND IT JUST THE MORE HE WARMS UP AN ABSURD AMOUNT OF WARM UP THE BETTER HE GETS AND THE BETTER HE GETS IN POWER PRODUCTION AND THE BETTER GETS IN SPEED AND VELOCITY SO HIS WARM UP PRIOR TO GAMES IS IT'S TOTALLY ABSURD AND JUST THE MORE VOLUME WE THROW AT HIM THE ETTER HE DOES I HAVE OTHER FOLKS YOU GET PAST LIKE TWO OR THREE REPS AND FATIGUES ARE SO SET IN AND NOW HERE ACTUALLY LIKE PRODUCING POWER PRODUCTION SO THERE IS A TON OF VARIATION THAT GOES IN THA I CAN GIVE YOU SOME GUIDELINES THEM YOU NEED TO DIFFERENTIATE IF YOUR TRAINING FOR SPEED POWER STRENGTH OR I PERCHFY HERE'S WHAT IF WE UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BUT ABOUT WHAT'S CAUSING THE ADAPTATION THAT'S GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO DO OR AVOID FOR EXAMPLE VOLUME IS THE PRIMARY DRIVER IN HYPERTROPHY AN TENSITY IS THE PRIMARY DRIVER IND SPEED POWER AND STRAIN  WHICH WHAT THAT MEANS IS YOU NEED TO PRESERVE INTENSITY FOR THE FIRST THREE YOU NEED PRESERVE VOLUME AND THE SECONE AT MOST SO IF YOU'RE WARM UP IS SO EXCENT EXTENSIVE IN THE HYPERTRY TRAINING THAT IT COMPROMISES YOUR TRAINING VOLUME BECAUSE OF FATIGUE EVEN IF IT COMPROMISES THE LAST SET OF THE LAST EXERCISE THEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY PROBABLY WALKING YOURSELF BACKWARDS BY DOING THAT EXCENSIVE YOU'DAV BEEN BETTER OFF STARTING YOUR FIRST WORKING SET SLIGHTLY SU OP TEM I CAUSE IT'S NOT YOU'RE JUST PRYING OUR CRUE VOLUME AT THAT POINT STRENGTH AND POWERS THE OPPOSITE AND TELL YOU'R MOVING VERY VERY FAST OR POWERFULLY YOU'RE NOT REALLY CAUSING THE ADAPTATION SO THERE'S NO PONY STARTING YOUR WORKING SET UNTIL YOUR REALLY BASICALLY AT A HUNDRED PER ET SO THE WARM UP SHOULD BE AS LONG AS IT TAKES YOU TO GET TO WHERE YOUR MOBILITIES IN THE RIGHT SPOT LIKE YOUR JOINS FEEL GOOD YOU FEEL FRESH YOU FEL ACTIVATED AND YOU REALLY FEEL PIQUE POWER ANYTHING BEFORE THAT IS A WARM UPSET IND THE SPORT OF OLYMPIC WAY LIFTING A A LOT OF TIMES THE COACHES WILL MEASURE BARBA VELOCITY TRAVES MASH HAS DONE A FANTASTIC JOB WITH THIS HE'S GOT A LOT OF DAT ON WAS CALLED VELOCITY BASE TRAINING A BRYING MAN AT MISSOURIAN AND MYAMI TONS A WORK HERE AND GENERALLY THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE NOT GOING TO COUNT ANY RE PETITION AS A WORKING SET AND TELL YOU EXCEED SEVENTY PER SENT OF YOUR WONDER AT MAX WHERE THAT'S CHANGE BECAUSE OF AA LOT OF PEOPLE DOING THE VELOCITY STUFF IS NOW THEY'RE BASIN THAT SIMPLY ON AND ACHIEVED VELOCITY AND SO REALLY THE WARM UP IS IRRELEVANT THEY DON'T EVEN IT'S SORT OF JUS LIKE DO WHIT EVER YOU WANT AND WORDER TO MEASURE THE BARBELL AND TILL YOU ACTUALLY ID AN OUTCOME AND NOW YOU'RE WHAT A WORKING SET A SO DIFFERENT WAYS TO THINK ABOUT IT A DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU'RE TRAINING FOR THAT'L GIVE YOU LITTLE BIT OF A GUIDELINE IF YOU'RE TRAINING FOR ANYTHING PASSD I PERTRIVE THEN REALLY AND SPECIALLY EVEN I PERT IT JUST COMES DOWN TO ARE YOU FEELING A READY TO WORK ARE YOU COLD ARE YOU MOVING THOUGH CORRECT POSITIONS AND IF ALL THOSE THINGS ARE FINE I DON'T CARE IF YOU START A LITTLE BUT EARLY IN SAVE SOME GAS THE INEVESPECIALLY FOR YOUR PERSON LIKE YOU WHO MAY BE A BIT MORE INCLINE TO FATIGUE AQUICKLY A RELATIVE TO TREVER OS JUST HAVE NO RESPONSE TO TIG WHATSOEVER IS IT USEFUL TO DO MORE WARM UP AT THE BEGINNING OF A WORK OUT SAY BEFORE THE FIRST EXERCISE AND THEN ONCE ONE HAS ACHIEVED BOTH LOCAL AND SYSTEMAC YET WARM UP IN EIR GROTS A THEN PERHAPS ON THE SECOND OR THIRD EXERCISE FORTH EXERCISE ET CETERA WON OR MAYBE TE ZERO WARM UPS YET FAIR POINT WE GENERALLY THINK ABOUT WARM UPS IN A COUPLE OF WAYS THIS IS A REALY ACTUALLY THIS  VERY CLEVER QUESTION YOU WANT TO HAVE SOME SORT OF GENERAL GLOBAL WARM UP SCHEME AWE TEN TO PREFER DYNAMIC WARM UPS SO THIS IS WHOLE BODY MOVEMENTS RATHER THAN LIKE SITTING AND STRETCHIG A STATIC STRETCHING THINGS LIKE THE SO SOMETHING THAT INVOLVES MOMENTUM YOU AT MOMENTUM OR MOVEMENT RIGHT SO THIS IS LIKE A THINK ABOUT THIS AND LIKE OLD GIM CLASS LIKE YOUR HIGH NEESE AND YOURE IND YOU'RE BUT KICKERS AND JUST DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THAT WE ARE MOVING A DIFFERENT PLANES M YOU'RE MOVING JOINTS THROUGH TONS ARANGE O MOTION YOU'RE YOU'REGETTING A LOT OF MOVEMENT THERE SO YOU'R GETTING THE LOCAL WARM UP YOU'RE ALSO GETTING THE THE TOTAL OSTOMACH ACTIVATION EVERYTHING ELSE IS GOING ON THERE SO THAT ISWHA WLL BE CONSIDER BE A GENERAL WARM UP FIVE MINUTES IT IS A VERY  SUFFICIENT NUMBER PERHAPS TEN IF YOU'RE A SLOW GOER ACHY AND SOMETHINGS LIKE THAT AND YOU REALLY GOT TO GET THE ANKLE WARMED UP IF YOUR DOING LOWER BODY STOFF REALLY MAKES SURETHAT THAT'S MOVING CORRECTLY THE HIPSINIES WILL FOLLOW A UPPER BODY STOF REALLY GET THE TOLLER PLADES IN THE ACT LIKE MAKING SURE YOU'R GOING THERE AND  THE ELBOWS WILL FOLLOW AFTER THAT A SO FIVE TO SEVEN MINUTES OF A GENERAL WARM UP A LOT OF TIMES LIKE CLASSIC EXERCISE SCIENCE IT WILL EVEN JUST PUT YOU ON A BIKE CYCLING FOR FIVE MINUTES I DON'T LIKE THAT PERSONALLY A DYNAMIC MOVEMENT IS MORE PRFERRED IF YOU REALLY JUST MOVE BY DISON MENUTE YOU'LL BE FINE THERE NOW SPECIIFICITY WITHIN EACH MOVEMENT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOUR FIRST EXERCISE OF THE DAYS GENERALLY THE THING YOU'VE PRIOR TIES THAT'S OFTEN TIMES THE MOST IMPORTAN YOU'RE GOING TO DO F IT OFTEN TIMES IS ALSO THE MOST COMPLEX AND THE MOST MOVING PARTS SO IT TENDS TO BE MULTIE JOIN I TENDS THEREFORE YOU NEED TO HAVE A MOVEMENT PRECISION IN SKILLED DIL T YOU DON'T TYPICALLY STRARTE YOUR WORK OUTS OFF WITH THE FOREARM CURL IGHT LIKE THIS YU DON'T NEED A TREMENDOUS AMOUT A WARM UP TO GET GOING ON THAT YOU'RE GUST START OFF WITH MEDICINE BALTHROS OR A SNATCH OR SOME AGILITY WORK YOU YOU NEED TO HAVE THE WHOLE SYSTEM GOING BECAUSE MULTIPLE JOINTS ORE MOVING POSITION MATTERS TECHNIQUETHERE JUST A LOT OF SKILL REQUIREMENT ET CETERA SO THE INDIVIDUALIZED WORK OUT A ORTHE SPECIFIC WORK OUT A SPECIFIC MOVEMENT FOR THAT VERY FIRST ONE MY GENERAL RULE THUMB IS LIKE WHATEVER IT TAKES TO MOVE PERFECT IN THAT FIRST EXERCISE PASS THAT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY NEED TO O INDIVIDUALIZE WARM UP FOR YOUR NEXT MOVEMENTS UNLESS IT IS A MOVEMENT YOU'RE TRYING TO LEARN OR DOEST EVEN GET ALIABIT BETTER AT I DROP THE LOAD A LITTLE BIT WORK ON SOME ACCRUING SOME PRACTICE RAPS FANTASTIC OR IT'S ANOTHER DISSIMILAR COMPLEX MOVEMENT SO LET'S SAY YOUR FIRST EXERCISE WAS  A FRONT SQUAT YU GOT LOATER FOR THAT ANALGON O MOVE INTO A PULL UP BUT YOUR MECHANICS AREN'T THE BEST THERE UNSO YOU REALLY NEED A CHANGE AND DOSOM MAY BE MORE SPECIFIC ACTIVATION ALORMUPS FOR THAT OR SOMETHING  ORSE RUNNING OR R SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT SO YET YOU DON'T KNOND O REWARM UP FOR EVERY SINGLE EXERCISE AS YOU GO GENTLY ONCE YOUR GOOD TO GO THE SAME MUSCLES THAT YOURE GOING TO USE IN THE NEXT EXERCISE ARE WARM SAME JOINTS THEN YOU'RE GOD TO GO YOU TALKED ABOUT INTENT WITHIN THE MOVEMENT WHAT ABOUT SPECIFIC CADENCEIS FOR REPETITIONS YE I WAS TAUGHT THAT ONE SHOULD LOWER THE WEIGHT SLOWLY THE WI'LL ALL THE ECENTRIC PORTION OF THE MOVEMENT AND THEN TO TRY AND EXPLODE THE WEIGHT THROUGH THE CONCENTRIC PASE AND THEN ALSO MAKE SURE THAT ONE IS USING FUL RANGE OF MOTION AND PERFECT FORM YE AS IT WERE NOW OF COURSE THAT IS ONE TINY SLICE OF THE POSSIBLE REPCADENCEIS YE AND WAYS TO APPROACH RESISTANCE TRAINING ALTHOUGH I THINK IT'S A PRETTY GOOD ONE YE WHAT ARE THE GENERAL PRAMETER THATS THAT ONE NEEDS TO CONSIDER YOU COULD IMAGINE LIFTING WITH YOU FOR SECONDS CONCENTRIC LIE FOR ONE PAUSE FOR TWO E CENTRY I REALIZ TE'S AN INFINITE NUMBER OF VARIATIONS HERE YE BUT IS THERE WAY TO USE REPCADENCE REPETITION CADENCE THAT IS AS A WAY TO WORK THROUGH WEAK POINTS A AND TO BE STRONG IN EVERY POSITION OF THE MOVEMENT YE A LOVELY QUESTION I THINK THE THE WAY I WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER THIS IS MAY BE GOING BACK JUST A TOUCH TO GET DIRECTLY TO THAT SO I THINK IF WE WALK THROUGH POWER STRANGTH AN APERTROPHE AND I HIT YOU WITH THE CONCEPTS AT ARE SPECIFIC TO EACH ONE THAT'S GOING TO LAY OUT YOUR ANSWER BECAUSE THE MOST TRUE ANSWER THERE IS IT DEPENDS ON THE GUAL THE ANSWER FOR WHAT IS OPTAMLE FOR STRENGTH IS DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED FOR PETENSI WITS OPTIMIZE FI PERTROVY THE SAME EXACT THING CAN BE SAID FOR MOMENTU SO WE'VE CLASS THEY HEARD THINGS LIKE THIS I MEAN O DON'T BALANCE AT THE BOTTOM I'M YOU'RE CHEATING SO IF YOU'RE DOING A LAP PULL DOWN OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW YOU DON'T YOU DON'T BOUANCE SOME REBOUND YOU DON'T YOU STOP AT THE BOTTOM SLOW DOWN ALL THESE THINGS ARE THOUGHT TO BE TRUISMS OF STRENGTH CONDITIONING BUT GUESS WHAT THOSE ARE ALL TRUISMS ASSUMING WE'RE TRYING TO GROW MUSCLE AND THAT'S THAT ACTIALY GOES BACK TO OUR CONVERSATION AND AND EPISODE ONE ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS WE THINK ARE IS FUNDAMENTAL TRUCE ABOUT STRENGTH TRAINING ARE JUST FUNDAMENTAL TRUCE THAT CAME FROM THE BODY BELDING WORLD ANDTHEY'RE NOT WRONG THER GOOD IDEAS BUT THERE ARE THER ADAPTATIONS ONE NEEDS TO GET FROM STRENGTH TRAINING THAT ARE NOT JUST MAXIMASING MOSCEGROP SO WHAT AWILL LAY OUT TO YOU AS A CASE FOR WHICH YOU SHOULD BALANCE A CASE FOR WHEN YOU SHOULD GO FAST AS CAPSE FOR WHEN YOU SHOULD BE UNDER CONTROL  ALL THESE THINGS ARE OR DIFFERENT VARIABLES WE CAN MODIFY AND GET DIFFERENT ADAPTATIONS FOR IS HER WAY THAT YOU COULD LAY OUT FOR US OPTIMLE REPETITION CADENCES FOR STRENGTH SPECIFICALLY VERSES HYPERTOPHY SPECIFICALLY JUST A SORT OF BOOK END THE CONVERSATION AND THEN MIGRATE TOWARD THE MIDDLE IN TERMS OF REPCADENCES THAT WOULD CATISFY THE DESIRE TO HAVE A BIT OF BOTH WE CAN GET PRETTY CLOSE YET SO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT STRENGTH VERSES I PERTRIP YOU REMEMBER STRENGTH IS MOVEMENT HI PERTRIPHY IS MUSCLE SIZE THAT'S THAT'S THE THETHE KEY TO YOUR ANSWER HERE SO WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO GET STRONGER WHAT YOU'RE EFFECTIVELY TRYING TO DO IS GET BETTER AT PRODUCING A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF HORCE TORY MOVEMENT  NOW FORCE IS MAST TIME'S ACCELERATION SO WHAT'S THE MASS IN THE BAR MULTIPLIED BY HOW WELL I CAN ACCELERTEIT INTENTIONALLY GOING SLOWER IS ONLY REDUCING ACCELERATION RIGHT SO IT'S HARD TO ARGUE THAT GOING SLOWER I'S GOING TO IMPROVE STRENGTH CUT YURE' SIMPLY REDUCING ACCELRATION SO YOU NEED DO PRACTICE LIFTING HEAVIER AT A FASTER RATE NOW DOES THAT MEAN IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET STRONGER THERE ARE NO PHASES OF YOUR TRAINING IN WHICH YOU'LL SLOW DOWN AR BU NO OF COURSE NOT THERE ARE CERTAIN RULES AND DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS ORE YOU HAVE TO PAUSE THE BOTTOM F A LECT THERE'S THERE'S ALL KINDS OF LITTLE THINGS LIKE THERE BUT IN GENERAL WE WANT A THING ABOUT WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DO HERE WE'RE TRYING TO GET BETTER AT MOVING A HEAVIER MASS AT A FASTERATIOE ACCELERATION THAT IS MORE FOURCE THAT IS MORE STRENGTH I PERTROPHY IS NOT THAT THE GOAL HERE IS NOT A FUNCTIONAL OUTCOME IT IS WHAT IS NEEDED TO CAUSE THE MOST AMOUNT OF HYPERTROPHY AND WHEN YOU GET TYPERTRY THEN YOU'RE OPTIMAL CADENCE IS UP TO YOU YOU CAN DO ANY COMBINATION IN FACT YOU COULD DO IT THE SAME EXACT CADENS THAT YOU DID YOUR STRAINGTH TRAINING WIST AND GET THE SAME ADAPTATIONS AS I PERTRY IF YOU MODIFY THE OTHER VARIABLES APPROPRIATELY OR YOU COULD GO SLOWER OR YOU COULD DO PAUSES OR YOU COULD DO A THING THAT IS A CALLED TRIPHASIC TRAINING WERE YOU SPEND THE FIRST PHASE SEVERAL WEEKS OF YOUR TRAINING WERE YOU DO ECENTRICC ONLY S YOUE JUST LOWERING THE BAR N YOUR BASEY STOPPING YOU CAN THEN DO THE NEXT PHASE OF YOUR TRAINING WHICH IS ISOMETRICS WEO' JUST HOLDING AT THAT BOTTOM POSITION AND IN THE NEXT PHASE YOU'RE TRAINING YOUR FOCUSSING ON THE CONCENTRIC PORTION OF A RI TRYPHASE AC ONE TO THREE ECENTRIC ISOMMENTRIC ONCENTRIC SO THAT'S A FANTASTIC WAY O OF DEVELOPING ACTUALLY STRENGTH LITTLE BIT OF HYPERTROPHE BUT TOURE MANIPULATING THE VARIABLES AND TERMS OF HIW YOU'V EXECUTE THE REPETITIONARY YOU CAN ACTUALLY INDUCE A LOT OF HYPERTROPHY MOVING THE WAIY FAST AS YOU MENTION EVEN DOWN SO IN TO CONTROL NOW ONE THING ONE WILL NEVER ADVOCATE IS MOVING ANY SORT OF WAIGHT OR LOAD UN CONTROLLED THE ASSUMPTION HERE WHEN I'M SAYINGLE FAST IS YOU'RE ALWAYS IN CONTROL I NEVER WANT YOU BOUNCING AND CRUSHING YOUR STERNUM WITH THE BARBLE AF YOUR DEST BUT YOU YOU CAN MOVE AT A A LOTA RATE YOU CAN A THE IOMENTRIC I MENTION BECAUSE THIS IS WHEN THINGS LIKE BODYWEIGHT TRAINING COME IN TO PLAY YOU ABSOLUTELY YOU CAN GAIN STRENGTH AND EVEN A LITTLE BIT O HYPERTROPHY ESPECIALLY THE UPPER BODY DOING ISOMETRICS IS MUCH HARDER TO DO THIS BUT THE LOWER BODY I'M YU  YOU YOU OUTRUN THAT COVERAGE REALLY QUICKLY YOU NEED LOAD BUT THERE'S A LOT OWAYS THIS IS ALSO PROBABLY WHY PEOPLE HAVE DONE THINGS LIKE GON DE YOGA ONLY OR POLODIES OR SOME OF THESE THINGS THAT ARE BODYWEIGHT BASE AND THERE'S NO ECTURNAL LOAD AND THY'VE ACTUALLY INCREASE MUSCLE CISE S ON GETTNG THE PICTURE THERE ARE A TUN OF OPTIONS AND AM THE REPCADENCES HOWEVER CAN WE SAY THAT ONE SHOULD PICK A GIVEN REPCADENCE WITHIN AN EXERCISE RATHER THAN CHANGING IT FROM SET TO SET WITHIN AN EXCISE OR THAT ONE SHOULD PERHAPS EVEN PICK AT CERTAIN REPCADENCE FOR AN ENTIRE WORK OUT I'M SUSPECTING THAT YOUR ANSWER IS GOING TO BE IT DEPENDS YE IT IS BUT IF YOU KNOW I'M NECKIN THEY USE THAT IF YOU HAD A GUNDER YOUR HEAD CU SITUATION BUT IF YOU HAD A GUND YOUR HEAD WHAT WOULD BE THE REP CADENCE THAT YOU WOULD PESCRIBE YET FOR STRICTLY STRENGTH OR AS MUCH STRENGTH WITH AS LITTLE HYPROTRIPHY AS POSSIBLE AND IN PICKING THAT RAPCADENCE THEN IT THEREFORE HAS TO THREAD THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE YET EXERCISE BOUT SO YOU'RE ACTUALLY RIGHT YOU CAN BECAUSE OF THAT UNDULATING PERISATIONSELF I TALKED ABOUT YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO THIS AN A LOT AWAYS SO YOU COULD DO ONE EXERCISE AT THE BEGINNING WHERE YOU HAVE A SET CADENCE SAY A THREE ONE ONE IT IS LIKE A VERY ONE SO THAT'S CON SO THAT'S LIFTING FOR THREE PAUSE FOR ONE LOWER FOR ONE I BE GENTLY THE OPPISE O CASE TO THE FIRST NUMBER IS ALWAYS THE ECENTRIC GENERALLY O CASE O LELOWER NIXS I LOWERING THE THE WEIGHT FOR ACCOUNT OF THREE YE AUSE FOR ONE IT' TOLY DO HAS AN EXERCISE LIKE A DEAD LIFF STARTS CONCENTRIC AND FINISHD THES ECENTRIC BUT A BENCH PRESSTART HOTOGAS IT ELSET ART TO FINISH START TO FINISH IS THE BETERW Y T THINK ABOUT T YET SO IN IT I'LL CLARIFY ACTUALLY WHEN WE SAY THREE WHEN ONE WERE GENTLLY TALKING ABOUT ALMOST ALWAYS THE ECENTRIC IS A SLOWER PORTION REGARDLESS IF IT'S THE FIRST OF THE LAST RIGHT SO WETHER YOU'RE DOING A BENCH PRESS WHER THE ECENTRIC IS LOWERING THE BAR TO YOUR CHEST THAT'S THE FIRST PART OF THE MOVEMENT ONE TO THREE PAUSE ONE ONE UP WHICH MEANS EXCELERATE AS HARD AS YOU CAN THE WAY UP THAT'S WEOU DESCRIBED I AS SUPPOSED TO SAY A ROW A ROW WHICH IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE STARTING OFF CONCENTRIC SO YOU'RE TO BE PULLING THAT THING YOUR CHEST AS FAST AS YOU CAN UNDER CONTROL NOT SLIMMING OFF YOUR JEST HOLDING FOR ONE S ECONDAND IN TAKING THREE SECONDS TO LOWER BACK ON THE RACK OR ON THE GROUND OR WHATEVER SO THE REASON WE DO THAT IT IS SOMEWHAT IN TO IT IV BUT IT IS AGAIN TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT ADVANCINGS A BORE OR AN IMPLEMENT ON TO YOUR PHYSICAL BODY ADEN EXTREMELY FASTERATE THAT THAT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO TO DEAL WITH SO I THREE ONE WANT US A VERY STANDARD STRENGTH PROTO CALL THAT IT IS SOMETHING YOU COULD JUST RUN WITH IF THAT THAT'S ALL YU EVER WANTED TO DO OULD BE ABSOLUTELY FINE LOWER THE BAR FOR A COUNT WIT THREE A TAC TIANS A BEING APPROXIMATELY THREE IS YOU SUPER HARDLY ANYBODY IS COUNTING OFF NETHEENS PRECISELY  IT'S ISUPPOSE IT'S DUABLE BUT THEN PAUSING BRIEFLY YET AND THAT BRIEF IS ALMOST O THAT PAUSE IS ALMOST A UNMEASURABLE IT IS SIMPLY ARE YOU ON DER CONTROL BEFORE YOU TRANSITION FROM THESE CENTRE TO CONCENTRIC OR CONSACTIN EUCI ITS JUST A SAFETYTHING SO WON'T YOU FEEL DOWN YOU'VE REACHED COMPLETE RANGE A MOTION AUR RAGE TRANSITION THAN JUST GO YOU DON'T REALLY NEED TO GO LIKE THOUSAND ONE ANDTHEN GO UP I'S JUST MAKING SURE AGAIN WE DON'T SLAM WEIGHTS OFF BODY PARTS AND THAT FINAL ONE IN THE THREE ONE ONE IIS REALLY FAST THE EXECUTION OF THE USUALLY CONCENTRIC PORTION OF THE EXERCISE YET IT IS FASTAG YOU BOSS WE CAN NO GES TO THAT WOULD BE FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE OUTCOME BEING STRENGTH YET AND OF COURSE WE SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE AGAIN THERE ARE TEN OF VARIATIONS THAT ONE COULD IMPLEMENT THERE BUT THA THAT WOULD BE GOD STARING PLACE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S MAINLY INTERESTED HYPERTROPHY  WHAT WOULD BE THE RAP CADENCE THAT A IF YOU HAD A GUNDER YOUR HEAD THAT YOU WOULD PRESCRIBE I WOULD PROBABLY DO THE EXACT SAME THING BUT I WOULD LIKE IT WOULD MAKE THE LAST NUMBER TWO SO THREE ONE TO YOU GET ALSO JUST KEEP THREE WONT ON IT IS STILL VERY FINE  EVEN EXPLODING ON THE CONTRACT IS STILL A FAT HIGHLY EFECTIVE FOR TRAINING HA PRETRY SO IF YOU WNHT TO KEEP A SUPER SIMPLE AND JUST MAKE REP CADENCE NOT A VARYABLE THAT YOU PLAY WITH CAUSD YOU HVE OTHER ONES TO MOVE THAT'S GREAT IF YOU WANT TO ADD A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO THE CONCENTRIC PHASE FINE IT'S NOT GOING TO DO IT'S NOT GOING TO MAKE ENOUGH OF A DIFFERENCE FOR MOST PEOPLE FOR YOUTA REALLY WORRY ABOUT I GUESS ITS THAT SORT OF THE POINT OF REALLY ONE MAY THIS IS WORE CLASSIC ITIS THE CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF WORE DEEP INTO A METHOD RIGHT IF YOU LONG AS YOU AT THE CONCEPTS I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER WHETHER YOU WANT TO DO THREE ONE ONE THREE TWO THREE THREE THR THREE TRIPHASIT AIN'T I THINGS THIS IS JUST A METHOD CHOICE IT DOESNIT MEAN THER IUR RELEVANT THEY ARE THERE ARE SUBTLE CHANGES WITHIN THEM IT'S JUST EIGHTY TWENTY ERLL RIGHT SO EIGHTY PER CENT OE BENEFIT IS GOING TO BE FROM THE CONCEPT TWENTY PER CENT IS THIS SMALL THING IF YOU'R SUPERINTO THIS FIELD ORE YOU ACTULLY WNT A WORK OF QUALIFIED A CERTIFIED COACH OR SOMETHING THEY EAT THERE'S LOTS OF REASONS TO PLAY WITH THIS IF YOU'RE JUST ON YOUR OWN HERE AND RUN IN THIS THING THREE ONE ONE IS FINE THREE ONE TO TOTALLY FIND ANYTHING LIKE THAT I YOU REALLY JUST ANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IN THE STRENGTH SIDE O THE EQUATION YOU'R UNDER CONTROL AND YOU CAN ADD ENOUGH LOAD TO STIMULATE STRENGTH AND NOT GET HERT WITH AN ACUTE TROMA RIGT ON MY PERTRY SIDE YOU JUST WANTING TO LOAD ENOUGH TO WHERE YOU CAN GET VOLUME I YOU GOT A PUT A LOT HONOUR SO IF YOU WANT TO GO LIGHTER IF YOU WANT TO GO SLOWER FINE YOU IF YOU GO SLOWER IN YOUR RE PETITION SO MAYBE EVEN LIKE A FIVE SET SECOND E CENTRIC A TWO SECOND PAUSE A THREE SECOND RISE THAT'S GREAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY THEN STIMULATE THE SAME AMONT OF HYPERCHIPY AND EITHER DO IT WITH LESS WEIGHT OR DO IT WITH LESS REPETITIONS SO IT'S A VARIABLE YOU CAN PLAY WITH IF YOU'RE LIKE HAY I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH WAITS AT MY HOUSE O ONLY HAVE A KETTLE BELLER A DUNBELL HOW AM I GOING TO STIMULATE HYPERCROPHY E YOUR ONLY OPTION IS REALLY DOING MOR RAPS WELL EVENTUALLY THAT THAT TRAIN RUNS PRETTY SHALLOW OKE HERE'S THE THING YOU CAN'T PLAY WITH MAYBE JUST AD TIME UNDERTENSION OR CALLING RAM IM JUST YOU DO SLOWER RE PETITIONS GO LONGER ONES AND HOLD IT SO IT'S A VARIABLE THAT WE USE TO INDIVIDUALIZED PROGRAMS RATHER THAN SOMETHING THAT YOU SHOULD REALLY BE FOLCUS ON US LIKE A COR ASPECT THAT'S GOINGTO BE DRIVING WHETHER NOT YOUR PROGRAM WORKS IT'S US A TOOL WE CAN PLAY WITH IN THE WHAT IF CENARIOS IM I WILL USE THIS STUFF A LOT WHEN I'M TRAVELING YOU CAN DO A TREMENDOUS WORK OUT IN YOUR HOTEL ROOM JUST DOING LIKE A TEN SECOND ESTCENTRIC A TEN SECOND HOLD A TEN CENTRIC CONCENTRIC YOUI'VE HAD SOME DECENT HOTEL ROOM WORK OUTS THEY'RE NOT MY PREFERENCE BUT A BY SIMPLY DOING THINGS LIKE AM TEN SECOND LOWERING A HAND STAND PUSH UP AGAINST THE DOOR TOTA A OBVIOUSLY ASSISTED FOR ME I DON'T I CAN'T DO FREE HANDS IN PUSH UP YAM I BUT JUST DON'T HAVE THE SKILL ORTHE STRENGTH ARE BOTH AM YOU CAN DO SOME SORT OF CONFIGURED DIPS BETWEEN THE BEDS OR CHAIRS AND THIS KIND OF THING AM REALLTHAT IS PUT SQUATS OR GREAT TO DO IN HOTELS BUT YOURE BACK FOOT UP ON A ON A BED GET AN AMAZING SPUT SQUAT WORK OUT NONE YE LUGLOOBRIDGE IS LOTS OF SOMETHING YE WITH A JUMPROPE IF YOU'VE EVER HEARD SOE ONE JUMPING IN THE MORNING A WO YE AM  MAY R MAY NOT BEN ME COUD BE ANY NUMBER OF THINGS BUT I NOWN TO SKIPPER OPEN A IN HOTEL RUMS A NOT TO GET OVERLE DETAIL BUT I THINK THERE ARE GOING TO BE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WONDERING ABOUT HOW TO BREATHE DURING REPETITIONS AND HOW TO BREATHE IN BETWEEN SETS SO I'D LIKE TO JUST BRIEFLY TOUCH ON THIS AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO RETURN TO AGAIN WHEN WE HAVE OUR DISCUSSION ABOUT RECOVERY YET BUT IS THERE A GENERAL RULE OF THUM FOR HOW TO BREATHE DURING REPETITIONS DURING WORK YET FOR STRENGTH MAYBE VEN STRENGTH VERSES HYPERTROPHY IN IN A WAY THAT MAXIMRISES OXYGEN AND PUT TO THE SYSTEM HE KEEPS YOU A ALERT N  CONSCIOUS BUT THIT ALSO PROTECTS THE BODY BY CREATING SOME RIGIDITY IN THE SYSTEM MIGHT BE A CERTAINLY BEING DEEF AWITH ALL YOURR EXILED THE BODY IS A VERY DIFFERENT BEAST IN TERMS OF STABILITY THEN WITH THE BODY FULL OF AIR PERSIS YOU DON'T BREATHING DURING THE REPETITION MOVEMENT THERE'S A  MANEUVER THAT IS LONG BEEN A LA BLET THE VOSALVA TECHNIQUE SO WHAT THAT REALLY MEANS IS YOU'RE TRYING TO USE ERROR TO CREATE INTERADOMINAL PRESSURE AN WHAT YOU'REREALLY TRYING TO DO IS CREATE A CYLINDER AROUND YOUR SPINE ITHE REAL ISSUE YOU HAVE TO TO PLAY HERE IS REGULATION OF BLOOD PRESSURE AND SPINAL STABILITY NOW YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO BREATHE IAN BRACE HAT I MEAN BY THAT IS YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO CRATE TOTAL INTERDOMINAL PRESSURE REGULATE A SPINE CONTROL LALL BREATHING IT'S JUST VERY HARD FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE TO DO IT'S IT'S A SKILL YOU SHOULD ABSOLUTELY WORK ON I'M YOU CAN ACTUALLY YOU CAN DO THIS AND YOU CAN GO AROUND LIKE I DO THIS DRICKEN GLASS AND SOONS CAN COMEIN LIKE CAN PUSH ANY PART I'M OF MY ENTIRE ABDOMEN IT IS SUPERTITE ANDI CAN TALK OW IT'S GOINGTO BE LITTLEBUT LABOR YOU CAN HEAR A LTTLE BIT OF DIFFERENCE BUT YOU SHOULD BEABLE TO DO THAT IF YOU HAVE TO LIKE HUNCH DOWN AND YOU CAN'T EVEN MUSTER BREATH AND IT TAKES THAT TO CREAT PRESSURE YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY A YOU DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE ADOMINABLE CONTROL NECESSARY TO CORATE THAT'S STABILITY SO STEPNABLE WANT IS THAT'S THEGULL NOW WITH THE BLOOD PRESSURE THING WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE A STANDARD BLOOD PRESSURE A IDEALLY IF WE SAT AROUND RIGHT NOW IT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING LIKE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY OVER EIGHTY STOLIC BIRST IS ISTOLIC THAT'S A NORMAL NUMBER I I BLOOD PRESSURE IS SOMETHING OVER THAT WELL WITH AN ACUTE ABOUT OF EXERCISE YOU CAN SEE THAT NUMBER REACH IS HIGHS LIKE FOUR FIFTY OVER THREE FIFTY WHIT'S THE FECTUALLY MEANS YOU HAVE TOTAL BLOOD INCLUSION RIGHT YOU'RE BOOD PRSSURE SO HIGH BLOOD IS NOT MOVING ANYWHERE AND SO THE MIDDLE OF A VERY HEAVY SAT ESPECIALLY COMPLEX MOVEMENTS ESPECIALY WHN THEY'RE LOADED ON YOUR BODY I'M THIS CAN BE AND OVERHEAD PRESS IR R SQUAT VARIATIONS AN LIKE THAT I' BLOOD PRESSURES CAN BE PROBLEM AND REASON WHY THAT MATTERS IS THAT'S AT GONETO MAKE YOU PASS OUT IT'S NOT THE FACT THATYOU RAN OUT O OXYGEN IN THREE SECONDS IT'S THE FACT THA LOOD PRESSURE GOT SO HIGH YOU BLOCKED DOUTAN'S SO WE WANT TO HAVE HAVE TO PLAY THIS GAME OF RELEASING A LITTLE O THE PRESSURE SO WE CAN ACTUALLY GET BLOOD TO MOVE A LITTLE BIT MAKING SURE THAT WE DON'T LOSE SPINAL STABILITY I'M SO LE CAN FINISH OR WORK UT THAT'S REALLY THE QUESTION YOU ASKED R I HADE I PLAY THIS GAME OF OH I HAVE SEVERAL HUNDRED POUNDS ON MY BACK OR MY CHEST AND I DON'T WANT O EX HAIL RIGHT SO THAT DON'T LOOSE SPINAL STABILITY BUT AT THE SAME TIME I DON'T WANT TO PASS OUT I WHICH IS A WHICH IS A PROBLEM SO A CON OF A COUBLE OF RULES O THUM IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING SOMETHING IN WHICH YOU CAN COMPLETE THE ENTIRE EXERCISE WITHOUT A BREATH AND IT IS OF A MAXIMAL OR CLOSE TO LOAD THAT'S PROBABLY YOUR BESSTRATEGY SO THAT PARTICULAR CASE YOU'LL SEE A LOT OF BREATHING TECHNIQUES IM WHERE YO'REGNGTO TAKE A VERY LARGE AND HAIL IDEALLY THIS IS DONE THROUGH THE ABDMEN NOT THE SHOULDERS SO WE SHOULDN'T SEEN CLABICALS RISING DURING THE SANG  YOULL SEE COMMON MISTAKE OF OF THE BARS ON THEIR BACK ANDYOU SEE PEOPLE DO THIS LIKE BIG INHAL THING AN ALL THEY DO IS ELEVANT THEIR CLOPENS TAT'S NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO INCREASE PRESSURE THROUGH THE ABLIMENTS WHICH IS LOICH YOUR LOOKING FOR SO YOU WANT TO BE THINKING ABOUT BELLY MOVING OUT IN ALL FOUR AREAS IN FRONT OF YOU TO YOU'RE LEFT IN RIGHT AND TO YOUR BACK THAT'S THAT QUADRENT SORT OF IDEA OF STABLIZING YOUR SPINE YOU CAN DO THAT INDEPENDENT OF YOUR CLAPICALS MOVING YOUR SHOULDERS DON'T NEED TO RISE FOR THAT YOU DON'T REALLY NEED THE OXYGEN FOR I METABOLIC PR PASES YOU'RE JUST USING THE AIR FOR A BRACE THAT'S REALLY ALL YOU'RE AFTER TOU TRYING TO VISUALIZE YOUR TOR SO AS MORE R LESS A CYLINDER YET AND YOU'RE TRYING TO FILL IT WITH AIR THE LOGIC BEING THAT IF I WERE TO PUSH DOWN ON TO A SAY OF A FULL UNOPEN CAN OF SODA YET WATER FOR ALL YOU SUGAR FOBS IE UNDERWATER A AND THEN PUSH AS HARD AS I COULD IT'S GOING TO BE HARD FOR ME TO CRUSH THAT CAN BUT IF THE CAN WERE EMPTY OR IF IT WERE LITLE BIT KINKED IN THE MIDDLE CORRECT THEN I COULD LIKELY CRUSH THAT CAN YET WHAT YOUR REALLY DOING IS YOU HAVE YOUR SPINAL RECORS IN THE BACK AND THEN A WHOLE SERIES OF ADOMINAL ETERCISES AND YOU ACTUALLY HAVE SOME NURRAL CONTROL SYSTLEMATIC CONTROL OF CONTRACTING THUS BUT THE YOU DON'T HAVE MUSCLES ON THE INSIDE O SO YOU'RE BASTELY BRINGING IN AIR IN SAYING I'LL USE AIR TO PUSH FROM THE INSIDE OUT N I' USE MUSCLES PUSH FROM THE OUTSIDE AND TO CRATE THIS BRACE AND I DON'T WANT OVER COMPRESSION WITH THE MUSCLES THIS IS A I CUPD YOU IF YOU SEE PEOPLE THAT HAVE JUST ENORMOUS SPINAL RECTORS SOME TIMES THAT'S AN NINDICATOR OF AF ACTUALLY A POOR BREATHING ARE BRACING STRATEGY BECAUSE YOU'RE USING SPINAL RECTORS CRATE ALLTHE COMPRESSION AND NOT ACTUALY USING THE INSIDE ENOUGH IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE BUT SORE LIKE A THING TO THINK ABOUT SO OVER COMPRESSION THROUGH THESPINAL RECTORS IS NOT NECESSARY IDEAL IM YOU IF YOU WANTED THE THE BEST CENAREO IS A LITTLE BIT OF A BRACE OF BOTH SO USE SOME AIR TO PUSH THIS SIDEASE SOM MUSTCOT TURE TO PRESS THAT WAY AND T EN THAT THAT SPYINE IS IS NICELY HELD IN POSITION IM AGAIN NOT IN A POSITION WHERE I'VE LOCKD DOWN MY DIAPHRAN WHEN I CAN'T GET ANY AIR OUT I SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THAT BRACE PATTER IM IN THE BEABLISPIC AFFACTLICT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW AND YOU'LL SEE LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF EF IF YOUR REALLY PAYING ATTENTIONTO MY VOICE YOU CAN HEAR LITTLE BIT OF A SUBTLE DIFFERENCE BUT I SHOULD BEABL TO THIS FOR QUITE A LONG TIME RIGHT LIGHT I I WOLDI COULD TAKE A MAXIMAL REPRI HERE IN THIS POSITION WHETHER I'M OVER AT PRESSING DOING SOME SORT OF ROW LIKE ANYTHING AND FEEL FAIRY BRACED IN AN ENTIRE QUADRON THIS IS VERY HELPFUL I I'M GOING TO WORK ON IT BUT CAN WE SAY THAT A AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO START OFF IN TERMS OF BREATHING TURING REPETITIONS WOULD BE TO TAKE A GULP OF AIR DURING THE LOWERING PHASE THE ECENTRIC FASE AND THEN TO EXHAL DURING THE YET CONCENTRIC EXERTION FASE I ASK THAT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING FOR A WHILE AND MAFOR ME FEEL SAFE I DON'T KNOW IF I AM AND IT ALLOWS ME TO EXHAL AS I EXERT THE THE A HARDEST PORTION OF THE EXERCISE YET AND PERHAPS I ALSO BORROWED THAT FROM MARSHALARDS WHERE ONE TENDS MOST OFTEN IS TRAINE TO EXHAL ON THE ON THE STRIKE YET IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING AGAIN THE NUMBER OF RE PETITIONS CAN BE COMPLETED WITHOUT A BREATH A LOT OF TIMES YOU'RE BETTER OFF SAVING THAT EXCLANATION INTO  COMPLETE WELL BUT IF YOUDON'T AF TO BUT FOR A REASONABLY HAVY SAID OF HACK SQUATS OR EVEN LEG EXTENSIONS AND GIVEN TA ALREADY CAN'T LEE LIKE EXTENSION MY BOISHON WAY MAYBE  STAUISE I MAY TIS IS WHY IM YTHE ID E OF HOLDING MY BREATH FOR AN TIRE COMPOUND SET SO AGAT I'M CLAIN LOIN TO MINE IUM YOU KNOW LIKE WEARS MY INSURANCE CARD WHO'S GOIN TO DRIVE ME TO THE HOSPITAL THIS KIND OF THING UM IN ALL SERIOUSNESS WHAT IF I WANT TO BREATHE DURING THE SET YET SO I'LL CLARIFY I'M GENERALLY MEANING IF YOU DOING LIKE A ONE RAT MAX OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OCAM SO THE TURN LI COULD HOLD MY BREATH FOR A ONE REPETITION MAXIM THAT  MAY BE LIKE A DOUBLE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU'R DOING MIKE MABE A TRIPLE I BENCH PREAST YOU CAN PROBABLY DO THREE AND GET A WIF IT ESQUAT TO GETS HARDER THAT LIF SO IT COME I TO ENS AN EXERCISE IM YOU WANT TO TAKE THAT BEATH BREATH THE PRIOR TO THE ECENTRIC PORTIONNON DURING SO  VHERY LOWER BREATHE IN WACK OR SET AND NOW START OUR MOVEMENT PATEN WHEREVER'S CINTO BE IMEXHAILING ON THE CONCENT PROPORTION DURING IT IS FINE IT IS NO PROBLEM M ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE NOT EXTREMELY HEAVY AND YOU'RE UC YOUR IWAERE YOUR THOUGHTS ON GRUNTING AND SCREAMING YES FINE I DON'T CARE I DON'T TEND TO DO THAT IM OCCASIALLY KNOWN TO SQUEAL OR WHIMPER  BUT I N BE NA BATT YOUR PERSON I DOIT VERY QUIETLY I THINK OF YOVEN I THINK SQUEAL WEMPER ABSOLUTELY THINKS IM IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING MULTIER RE PETITIONS I WHAT WE ACTUALLY DO FOR HE ANIF A COMBINE AS WE TEAH THEM A VERY SPECIFIC EXCELLSTRATETY SE LERS ONE TEST THAT THEY DO IWHICH IS THEY BENCH PRUSS TWON AN TWENTY FIVE POUNDS FOR AS MANY REPTS AS POSSIBLE A LOT OFTHESE PEOPLE WILL GET TWENTY FIVE TO FORTY REPETITIONS SO WE HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC READING PATTER IT WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE IF WE THINK THAT THEY'RE GING TO DO AROUND TWENTY FIVE RAPS SAY THAT'S LIKE OUR GOAL WE MIGHT SALE CA DO THE FIRST TEN WITH OUT OF BREATH IN AN EXHALE WE SET AND IN DO FIVE BREATH AND YOU MIGHT DO FIVE BREATH THREE BREATH TWO BREATH AND N ONE BREATH PER RAP UNTIL WE CAN'T GET I MORE IM SO WE'LL HAVE VERY SPECIFIC STRATEGIES FOR THEM IM SO WHAT I WOULD SAY IS IS THINK ABOUT HOW MANY YOU'RE GOING TO COMPLETE AND AND THEN BREATHE A CORDING SO THT AND IT TENDS TO INCREASE IN FREQUENCY AS THE NUMBER GETS CLOSER TO FAIL YOUR CATURE ON TO WANT THAT THAT AIR A LET ABIT BUET YO JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN YOUR REE WHEN YOU'RE BREATHING BACK IN YOU'RE IN A SAFE SPOT SO YOU DON'T WANT TO BE CATCHING THAT LIKE RE BREATH WHEN THE WEIGHTS ON YOU YOU ANT TO BE IN A LOCKED OUT POSITION OR AWAY FROM YOU WHEN YOU'RE STANDING I'M SO TENDS TO BE LIKE AT THE END OF THE EXERCISE NOT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT I WHICH S IT IS GOING TO BE RECIE PR PROBLEMS IF YOU TAKE YOUR BREATH THET ONE OF THE REASONS I'M SO HAPPY TO HAVE YOU HERE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION IS WE CAN REALLY GET INTO THE WEEDS BUT ALSO HIT A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS THAT I HEAR A LOT YET HOW DOES ONE CONTEND WITH THE FIRST ATTEMPT AT THE LIFT NOT WORKING OUT IS IT TOO HEAVY SOMETHING GOES WRONG HOFULLY NOT INJURY PROMOTING WRONG BUT SOMETHING GOES WRONG DO YOU COUNT THAT YOU RESET THE WORK OUT AND THEN THE COUNTER PART TO THAT QUESTION IS WOULD YOU DO IF IT'S TOO EASY WHEN WRONG BECAUSE YOU CAN PUT ENOUGH WEIGHT ON THE BAR DAN'T PICK UP A HEAVY ENOUGH SET OF DUMBELLS DO YOU ABANDON THE SET AND AND REPLACE IT WITH ANOTHER I GUESS IS REALLY A QUESTION OF HOW MUCH MARGIN FOR ERROR IS THERE IN VOLUME YET WHEN DOING THIS THREE BY FIVE PROGRAMM SUR A TWO THINGS THAT ELECTOSTARWHAT NEMBER ONE IS I TALKS ABOUT LENIG AFPUDIZATION AN UNDULANTING PERISATION THERE'S ACTUALLY IN NEW MODEL NEW ISH MODEL CALLED AUTO REGULATION WHICH BASELY SAYS YOURE NA GOIN TO DAY AND DEPENDING ON ANY NUMBER OF BILE MARKERS PERFORMANCE MARKERS OR YOUR PERFORMANCE YOU WILL ADJUST YOUR TRAINING BASED ON HOW YOU'R FEELING THAT DAY AND SO SEVENTY PER CENT AS THAT MAY BE FOR EXAMPLE NOT NECESSARILY SEVENY PER CENT OF YOUR WONER EPETITION MAX HIGHEST EVER IT SEVENTY PER CENT WHAT YOU CAACCANE DO THAT DAY AND SO IT ACTUALLY LOWS YOU TO AUTOR REGULATE YOUR TRAINING BASED ON ACTUALLY WIT'S HAPPENING AND SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE AS MUCH LONG TURN PLANNING IN YOUR PROGRAM DESIGN A BECAUSE IT'LL SORT OF FIGURE ITSELF OUT AS YOU'RE GOING YOU CAN USE VELOCITY DETERMINE THIS OUT O REGULATION YOU CAN USE ACTUALLY AS LIKE TAKING IT OUT TO CLOSE TO A MAX FOR THE DAY AND THEN BASING ON YOUR PERCENTAGES ON THAT DAILY MAX OR A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS SO THAT IS ACTUAL ONE OF VERY EFFECT OF STRATEGY AND TERE'S A LOD OF RESEARCH COMING OUT ON OUT O REGULATION THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO IT SO THAT'S ONE THING TO SAY ANOTHER THING TO SAY IS THIS THREATO FIVE OKT A IT DEPENDS ON IT FOR GOING FOR SPEED POWER OR STRENGTH BECAUSE WHILE ALL THOSE OTHER VARIABLES ARE THE SAME FOR THREE TO FIVE THE COR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHETHER THAT IS A POWER WORK OUT OR A STRENGTH WORK OUT IS THE LOAD RIGHT SO IF YOU ARE AT A MODERATE LOAD SAY THIRTY PERCENT OF YOUR ONE RE PETITION MAX UP TO ABOUT SEVENTY PER CENT THAT'S GOING TO BE A POWER BASED ADAPTATION ASSUMING YOU'RE  GOING WITH HIGH INTENT YOU EEDIT I CHAR I I HAVE TO INTERRUPT MAYBE JUST CLEARIFY WHAT INTENT IS YET YOU'RE ATTEMPTING TO MOVE THE IMPLEMENT OR GO THROUGH THE MOVEMENT PATTERN AS FAST AS YOU CANT GREAT THANK YOU IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GO FOR STRENGTH AND YOU'RE BELOW SEVENTY PER CENT YOU'RE NOT REALLY GOING TO BE IMPROVING STRENGTH BECAUSE THE TOTAL MASS IS NOT HEAVY ENOUGH AND SO REALLY WHEN WE SAY STRENGTH WERE ASSUMING YOU'RE AT AT LEAST GENERALLY SEVENTY PER CENT OR HIRE INOW IF YOURE NEW TO TRAINING TONALLY DIFFENT THING I BUT IF YOU'RE MODERATLY TRAIN TO HIGHLY TRAIN YOU'R YOU'RE ENTOBE WAILE NORTH TOF SEVENY PER CENT SO NAME BELOW THAT WE DO'T RETHE COUNT ANYWAYS I THAT'S THOSE ARE WARM UPSET BASICALLY  SO ONE THING TO ACTUALLY GIVE YOU SOME VERY SPECIFIC NUMBERS HERE AND I DON'T HAVE ALL OF THESE MEMORIZE CAN PERHAPS  PROVIDE A CHART LATER SEND OUT SOMETHING TO THEM BUT HERE'S A CHART THAT YOU CAN LOOK UP CALLED A PRILIPAN CHART HOW D STROTER A P ARE I LL I P I N PRELEPANT AND THERE'S ACTUALY BEEN A FEW STUDIES ON IT IT SAY IT'S O IT'S IT'S BEEN OLD IT'S BEEN ON FOR VERY LONG TIME IT'S SORT OF IN THE COACHING ROUND THAT A HANDFUL OF STUDIES OUT A NEW ZEALAND CAME OUT VERIFYING IN INVALIDATING A LOT OF IT BUT WHAT A DEFECTLY DOES TAS AS IF STRENGTH IS THE GULL AND THIS COMES FROM THE THE POWER LIFTING WAIT LIFTING SIRTECMINTITS SORT OPTIMIZIN FOR STRENGTH THEN HOW MUCH TIME DO I NEED TO SPEND AT EACH INTENSITY RANGE SO SEVENTY PER CENT EIGHTY PER CENT NIGHTY PER CENT ET CETERA BECAUSE SPECIFICITY IS GOING TO SAY THIS IF YOU WANT TO GET BETTER NO'RE A MUSCULAR GUY ATS SHOOTING A BASKEBALL THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU COULD EVER DO AS SOUE TO BASCABALL UNDER THE EXACT CIRCUMSTANCES THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT RIGHT SPECIFICITY ALWAYS WENTS IF YOU WANT TO GET BETTER AT STRENGTH THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU NEED TO DO IS THAT EXACT MOVEMENT AT THAT LOAD IN IN THIS CASE IF YOU WANTER TO GET BETTER AT YOU'R BENCH PRESS LIFTING AT ONE HUNDRED PER CENT OF YOUR MAX ON A BENCH PRESS IS THE MOST SPECIFIC THING YOU COULD EVERY DO THE MORE YOU CAN DO THAT THE FASTER YOU WILL INCREASE YOUR BENCH PRESS MAX HOWEVER THAT'S A VERY HARD TO DO WITHOUT KITTING HURT IT'S ALSO NOT ADDRESSING WHAT I CALL YOUR DEFENDER SO IF THE REASON YOU CAN'T BENCH PRESS HIGHER THAN WHEREVER YOU'RE BENCHING NOW IT MAY NOT BE YOUR PURE STRENGTH AT MAY BE ANY NUMBER OF THINGS LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MOSSEUL OR TECHNEIQRE HE SAI O GET GREAT SO SPECIFICITY OVER HERE IM VARIATION ON THE OTHER SIDE SO WE'RE PLAYING THIS GAME WE'VE TALKED ABOUT OF OF HOW DO I MAKE SURE THAT I CAN HAVE ENOUGH SPECIFICITY N MY TRAINING WITHOUT LEADING TO A OVER YOU SENTRY ALL HOW DO I MAXIMIZE OR HOW DO I REDUCED MY CHANCE OF INJURY WHILE GETTING ENOUGH SPECIFICITY AND SO WE HAVE A CLASS OF PARADIM HOVERER  ONE ACTUALLY TRAINING PROTOCAL YOU CAN LOOK UP AS CALLE A BULGARIAN METHOD AND THE BULGARIANS WERE AN AMAZING I'M AT THE SPORT OF LIQUITING A PROBABLY A FACT A THE A THE THE PATRIARCH OF THIS ENTIRE THING RECENTLY PASSED AWAY I'VE BEN O BAT I'B AJEVE A NEM SULEMONAGLU POCKET HERCULES WHEN THE GREATEST WAY THEFTERS OF ALL TIME CAME OUT OF THE SYSTEM AND THEY DO A LOT OF THINGS BUT ONE EXAMPLE IN THE BULGARIUM SYSTEM IS YOU'RE GOING TO DO A ONE REPETITION MAXIMUMSTATCH YOU' TAKE A LITTLEBIT OF RET YOU'LL DO ONE REPETITION MAXIMUM CLEAN A DERK TAKE A LITLE BIT OF BREAT DO ONE REPETITION MAXIM UN FRONT SQUAT TAKE ALITTLE BIT OF BARAK AND YOU CAN REPEAT THAT TWO TOR THREE TIMES A DAY EVERY DAY THAT SPECIFICITY RIGHT THOSE PEOPLE GET EXTRAORDINARILY STRONG OW THEYDON'T DO THAT ALL YOU'RE ROUND THEY DON'T DOTH ALL THEIR LIFTERS BUT THIS IS WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO PEAQUE FOR A MAJOR COMPETITION LIKE THE OLYMPICS WE ARE GOING SO FAR INTO SPECIFICITY AND THAT WAS VERY COUNTER TO THE RUSSIAN SYSTEM AT THE TIME WHICH IS MUCH MORE OF OUR CLASSIC PEERTIZATION SORT OF ABROATH OK A SPECIFICITIES IS TREMENDOUS BUT IN DOING THAT THE BULGARIANS DISPRUTALIZE A LOT ATHLES RIGHT IS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO HANDLE SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU CAN'T REALLY DO THAT THAT LONG WITHOUT GETTING RECT AND THERE'S THE GOAL IS TO WIN METALS THE GOLLS  WITH IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT THING THAN LONGGEVITY I HERE WRIGHT LIKE WE'RE TRYING TO PUSH THE BOUNDARIES OF CORSTHETIC CHANGES UNLESS SOME ONE HAS A NATURALLY BALANCED PHYSIQUE TO IN GENERAL IF PEOPLE DO ONE SORT OF MOVMENT I FIND THAT THEY TEND TO RESEMBLE THE EQUIPMENT THAT THEY DID THET AND  THAT THAT TIM RE THAT'S A JOKE AGAINST KETTLE BELLS COURSE OF COURSE OF COURSE I GOT IT SO WE KNOW SPESTIBICITIES TACHNETLY OPTAMAL BUT IT'S NOT REALISTIC NOT FOR THAT KIND OF IT YOUEXTREME SITUATION SO HOW DO WE BALANCE THESE THINGS WELL HIT TURNS OUT THI'S PRILIP AN CHART GIVES YOU GUIDE LINES FOR HOW MUCH TIME AND BY TIME I MEAN HOW MANY REPETITIONS TO STAND I IN EACH OF THESE REP RANGES SO THAT YOU GET OUT OF THE BEST OF THIS WORLD YOU'RE GING AO FINED THE SAME THING BY THE WAY WHEN WE GET IN IN DURANCESTRAINING THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH TRAINING YOU CAN DO AT NINETY FIVE PER CENT OF YOUR HEARTRIGHT BEFORE STARTS BECOME A QUITE DETRIMENTAL YOU NEED T ACT YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME AT THOSE LOWER INTENSITIES SO THE PRILIPANT CHART WALKS YOU THROUGH HOW MANY SETS AND IT GIVES YOUR RANGE LIKE OU LIKE TA I THINK THAT THE BOTTOM OF IT IS LIKE HOW MUCH TIME YOU SPEND AT LIKE SIXTY TO SEVENTY PER CENT EOVERY ONE R A MAX AND IT SAYS LIKEING A MINIMUM OF THIS SET TO MAXIM OVOF THIS CET BUT THE IDEAL NUMBER OF REPS PER CENT PER WEEK IS LIKE EIGHTEEN AND THE 'L WALKS YOU THROUGH AND SO THERE'S THERE'S FOUR CRITERIA ON IT I THIN ITS FIFTY FIVE TO SIXTY FIVE PER CENT AGEN HOW MANY REPS THERES IS LIKE THREE TO SIX REPS PER CET IM EIGHTEEN TO THIRTY REPS TOTAL DI THINK THE IDEAL RE RANGES LIKE TWENTY FOUR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO IT GIVES TAKES YOU FIFTY FIVE OR SIXTY FIVE SEVENTY TO EIGHTY EIGHTY NINETY IN THE NINETY PLUSS PER CENT BUT YOU'LL SEE IS THE NINHTY PLUSS PER CENT NUMBER IT'S MORE LIKE ONE TO TWO REPS PER CET FOR TOTAL OF ABOUT SEVEN TOTAL REPETITIONS IF YOU START CRUISING PAST THAT I OTHER BAD THINGS SARCH CREEP UP IN THERE SO THAT'S A REALLY EFFECTIVE CHART WHAT IT REALLY HIGHLIGHTS THOUGH IS EVEN SOMEBODY WAS TRYING TO MAX MY STRAIN YOU'RE GOING TO SPEND SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY FIVE OR SO PER CENT OF YOUR TRAINING TIME BETWEEN THIS LIKE FIFTY FIVE TO SIXTY FIVE PER CENT RANGE SO YOU'RE ASKING ER LIKE WELL DO IKE EVEN COUNT THAT ONE THE AUNT THE ANSWER IS YA YOU IN THAT RANGE IF IT'S BEL FIFTY FIVE SIXTY PER CENT YOU PROBABLY DON'T COUNT IT NOW I GAN SOME COACHES DON'T COUNT ON US SITS EVEN AMOST SEVENTY FINE IT'S NOT A MADE YOUR DISTINCTION BUT YOU'RE GIN A SPEND THE BULK OF YOUR TIME YOW ACCUMULATING SOME SOME TECHNIC BASY AND SKILL AND TISSUE TOLERANCE VERY IMPORTAN  THE NEXT STEP UP IS LIKE TWENTY EIGHT PER CENT I THINK IS IS SORT OF TH THE CUT OFF OF HOW MUCH TIME YOU SPENT  BETWEEN SEVENTY ANDEIGHTY PER CENT EVERY ONE AT MAX AND THEN IT JUMPS DOWN LIKE TWENTY THREE PER CENT AND THEN ALL THE WAY TO TO SEVENTY PER CENTS SO YOU CAN WALK YOURSELF THROUGH THAT AND THAT GIVES YOU AN EXTREMELY GOOD GUIDE LINE AND YOU'LL NOTICE ALL OF THESE ARE STILL IN THREE TO FIVE RANGE IT'S JUST REALLY YOU'RE MANIPULATING AT BY TOTAL CETS OR TO ELEXORCISES SO THAT CAN GIVE YOU SOME STRUCTURE PLATE WITH WE'LL PROVIDE A LINK TO THE PRILIPIN SHART YET IN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS TRAINING TO FAILURE WHEN THE GOAL IS STRANGH YET SHOULD ONE DO IT SHOULD ONE AVOID IT WHERE DOES IT DEPEND WELL YET IT ALWAYS DEPENDS A THE WAY THAT ALL GENERALY SAY IT IS BECAUSE OF WHAT WE JUST OUTLINE T IN THE BRILIP IN CHART YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO FILYOUR SEE STRINTH AINS ESPECIALLY EARLY OR EVEN MODERATE AND I'M TALKING MAY BE FIVE PLUS YEARS IN YOU'RE LIFTING CAREER WOULD YOU UNCALL BEGINNER ZERO TO FIVE YEARS OF TRAINING INTERIMMEDIATE FIVE TO TWENTY YEARS OF TRIN YE SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND THEN ADVANCE WOULD BE PEOPLE THAT REALLY PUT THE TIME IND ENERGY INTO FINE TUNING THEIR PROGRAM THE VAST MAJORITY PEOPLE WHO THINK THEIR ADVANCE OR ARE REALLY WHAT WE CALL IT ERMEDIATE IN ALL THE REMAINS OF LIFE FER IT EVEN AS A SCIENTIST I YEAN QUITE RARE TO REACH THAT NUMBER OF ADVANCE SO I ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE ANY PRODEM GOING TO FAILURE QUITE OFTEN I'M ALSO FINAL OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO GO ALTHE WAY THERE YOU CAN GET MOST OF WHAT YOU NEED GETTING WILL BE CALL TECHTICAL FAILURE SO THIS IS LIKE O K THAT WAS REALLY CHALLENGING A BOY YOU STARTER O HAVE SOME BREAK DOWNS A TECHNIQUE WORE GON TO CALL THAT GOOD THE ONLY EXCEPTION HERE I I WANT TO POINT OUT IS PEOPLE WHO ARE EITHER NOVICE OR BEGINNERS THEY REALLY HAVE NO CONCEPT OF WHAT ONE HUNDRED PER CENT MEANS AND SO I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY VERY FRUITFUL TO TAKE THEM TO ONE  HUNDER PER CENT JUST TO GIVE THEM A GUIDLINE OF WHERE IT'S THAT NOW OF COURSE DO THIS ON EXERCISES THAT THEY ARE COMFARTABLE WITH OR CLOSE AND YOU MAYBEBE MABE THIS IS ON A MACHINE MAYBE THIS IS A SINGLE JOINT MOVEMENTS OR WHATEVER IT TAKES FOR THEM TO HAVE CONFIDENCE BUT I ACTUALLY I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD BE SCARED OF THES THET THEY'RE NOT REALLY AM THAT MUCH MORE DANGEROUS THAN AYTHING ELSE THERE'S AND WE THINK ABOUT IT IF YOU'E GON O DO A FRONT SQUAT THE'RE ANY EXERCISE AND YOU'RE ONE RO MAXES TWO UNDR POUNDS IS IT REALLY THAT MUCH MORE DANGEROUS TO DO ONE TRY AT TWO UNDRED FIVE POUNDS THEN IT IS TO DO FIVE TRIES AT A HUNDRED NINETY POUNDS IS ITE REALLY THAT MUCHMERNT NO LIKE IT'S NOT SO YOU CAN DO LIKE WE TALKD ABOUT IN THE THE FIRST EPISODE YOU CAN DO A REPETITION MAX ESTIMENT WILL YOU GET THE LIKE EIGHTY FIVE TO NINETY FIVE PER CENT WILL YOU THINK YOU ARE AND INSTEAD OF ADDING LOAD YOU JUST DOAS MANY REPTIONS YOU CAN GO GL THAT NUMBER AND THAT'LL TELL YOU THE CONVERSION ESTIMATEOF WHAT YOU'RE ON O MAXES THAT'S FINE BUT ALSO IAVE ABSELLY NO ISSUE IN FACT I GENERALLY ENCOURAGE IT TO TAKE PEOPLE UP TO THAT LEVEL CERTAINLY NOT DAY ONE OR ANYWERE CLOSE TO THAT BUT AT SOME POINT WET ELS SEE WHAT YOU ACTUALLY GOT I'M JUST I'M MUST CON A CUTIT OFF EARLY WHET I'M IN AT CONSIDER TO BE ONERA MAX ANYTHING MORE THAN MINE OR TECHNICAL BREAK DOWN IS IS FOR THAT CREW WERE IN A STOP AND CAN CALL THAT GOOD AN I DEALLY WITH A SPOTTER SPECIALLY AM IN A BENCH PRESSING DON'T BENCH PREST ALONE IN YOUR BASEMENT KIND OF THING A FEW PEOPLE DIE EACH YEARE FROM BENTRESSING ALONE IN THEIR BASEMENT YE WERE USE DUMBELLS IF YOU'REGONG TO DO THAT YEA HARD HEARTED TO DIE TE USING DON GET ELSE I SUPPOSE YOU COULD IM DROP THEM ON YOUR HEAD OR SOMETHING BUT NOT GET STUCK UNDER THEM U EXERCISE SELECTION AND FREQUENCY OF EXERCISE IMPLEMENTATION ACROSS THE WEEK SO I CAN IMAGINE WITH THIS THREE BY FIVE ROUTINE DONE THREE TO FIVE TIMES PER WEEK YOU CAN IMAGINE CHANGING UP THE EXERCISES EVERY WORK OUT ALTHOUGH  CONCERNING MOST OF THESE THREE BY FIVE ROUTINES ARE GOING TO BE DONE WITH COMPOUND MOVEMENTS GENERALLY THE SOONER OR LATER ONE RUNS OUT OF MOVEMENTS IF THE GOAL IS TO IT MAJOR ALL THE MAJOR MUSCLE GROUPS YET HOWEVER LETME GIVE AN EXAMPLE AND ASK IF IT'S OKY TO FOR INSTANCE DO THE THREE BY FIVE ROUTINE WER ONE OF THE EXERCISES FOR BACK AS TAY A BENT OVER ROW  YOU DO THOT MONDAY WEDNESDAY AND FRIDAY I YOU KNOW I CAN IMAGINE ONE COULD DO THAT AND STILL RECOVER AND IMPROVE OVER TIME BUT FIVE DAYS A WEEK BENDEVEROS FIVE DAYS A WEEK IS THAT OQET MEAN CAN ONE STILL PROGRESS AND AND THERE I COULD IMAGINE IT'S A STRONG ANSWER OF DEPENDS BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE RECOVER MORE SLOWLY EN OTHERS AM VERY COMFORTABLE DOING PITTYG MUSCLE GROUPS ONCE DIRECTLY PER WEEK AND ONCE INDIRECTLY THAT'S WORKE FOR ME FAR BETTER THAN TWO OR THREE TIMES PER WEEK YOU N I GET YOU KNOW LOOKS OF SYMPATHY WHEN WHEN I SAY THIS BUTS ISHY IS JUST HOW MY PHYSIOLOGY WORKS AN KIND OF YE WELL IT MAY BE I'M NOT OPTIMIZING A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FEATURES BUT YET THE POINT BEING THAT SOME PEOPLE REALLY DO SEEM TO BE ABLE TO TRAIN AT A MUSCLE EVERY DAY AND STILL MAKE PROGRESS OTHER PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE TROUBLE WHEN THEY TRAIN A MUSCLE EVERY DAY SO HOW DOES ONE ESTABLISH EXERCISE SELECTION WHEN THE GOAL IS TO MAKE PROGRESS AND AND THIS BRINGS UP SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT AND WEREIN TO HAV IN WHOLE EPISODE ABOUT THIS BUT LOCAVER SY SYSTEMIC RECOVERY YET YOU KNOW IS THE WHOLE NERVOUS SYSTEM BECOMING FATIGUED AND IS THE MUSCLE GROUP AND THE RELATED MUSCULAR SKELLTIL SYSTEMS BECOMING FATIGUE WEE RE GON TO GO BACK TO THINKING ABOUT WHEN WHEN YOU MAKE THESE COMMENTS ABOUT I TAKES YOU THREE TO FIVE DAYS AND YOU'VE GOT BETTER RESULTS THERE THE ASSUMPTION THAT YOU'RE PROBABLY RUNNING UNDER IS YOUR TRAINING STYLE IS MORE REFLECTING THAT RECOVERY TIME THAN IT IS YOUR PHYSIOLOGY IT'S NOT YOU ITIT'S HI YOUR TRAINING SO IF YOU LOOK AT AGAIN ALL THE ELEMPIC WAY LEFTORS IM THET AE COMPETING THEY'RE GIN TO BE SQUATTING OR SOME VERIATION OF SQUATTING EVERY DAY THAT THAT'S GON TO HAPPENED I LOT OTHE TIMES ARE RAINING MULTIPLE TIMES TODAY ADTHEY WILL BE DOING SOME BASEA BARBILL FULL SQUAT MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY EVERYDAY SIX DAYS A WEEK SOMETHING LIKE THAT THEY ARE THE BEST IN THE WORLD ARE ETTING POWERFULTHEY'RE TREMENDOUSLY GOOD A GETTING STRON YOU CAN DO IT RIGHT IT COMES DOWN A TO WHAT DOES YOUR VOLUME LOOK LIKE WHAT TYPE OF MOMENTS ARE YOU DOING AND WHAT REP RAINGE WHAT OVER ALL VOLUME ARE YOU HITTING NHOW ARE YOU DOING IT IF YOU LOOK AT ATHLETES THEY TRAIN THEIR LEGS EVERY DAY WHEN THEY'RE RUNNING AROUND THEIR DOING SPEED AGILITY TRAINING EVERY SINGLE DAY THEY DON'T NEED IN THREE DAYS TO RECOVERY CEEN IMAGINE AF BASCELL PLAYER TRY TO ASK OR LIKE THREE DAYS TO RECOVERY BETWEEN PRACTICE VET WELL TO BE FAIR AS YOU AS YOU CHUCKLE AT ME I'M DOING OTHER THINGS ON THE INTERVENING DAYS YES ALL TRAIN AT A MUSCLE GROUP MIKE LEGS AND THEN I'LL GIVE IT FOUR DAYS BEFORE I DO IN INDIRECT YAM EWHAT I CALL AN INDIRECT EXERCISE ORLIHTS WHICH FOR ME WOULD BE SPRINTING YET THEN AT GT TWO DAYS AND THEN I'M TRAINING THEM AGAIN BUT NONE THE LESS AND ATLEY HASE TO DO THAT EVERY DAY RIGHT RIGHT SO DEPTS A DANSWERS YOU ABSOLUTELY CAN TRAIN ANY THESE MUSCLES EVERY SINGLE DAY IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO VOLUME IN IT COMES DOWN TO MOVEMENT TYPE AND HOW ARE YOUGEATING SO WITH IN THE CASE OF OF WHALIFTERS AND AN ATLETES WOULD TEND TO SEE HAP AN IS THERE'S NOT A THERE'S TWO THINGS THERE IS A LONG PERIOD OF CONDITIONING AND I DON'T MEAN ENDURANCE WHAT I MEAN IS IS TISSUE TOLERANCE AND CONDITIONING SO Y THEY'RE NOT GOING TO START OFF THEIR CAREER AT THAT PAYS RIGHT THET ITHEIR CAREER MIGHT START OFF START OFF AT FIVE DAYS A WEEK BUT MAY BE EVERY OTHER OF THOSE DAYS IS A PV C PIPE ONLY ANDYUR JUST TRAINING THE MOVEMENT PATTERNS YOU'RE WORKING ON TICK AN ET CETERA THEN EVENTUALLY MAY BE AFTER SIX MONTHS OR YEAR THOSE PEEVIOU SEE PIPE DAYS TURN INTO BARBELE ONLY DAYS ANSTO NOW YOU WENT FROM NOW A POUND TO FORTY FIVE POUNDS THEN EVENTUALLY AS YOUR YEARS GO ON THAT THAT WRETCHIS UP SO IT DEPENDS ON THE STOLE IN GENERAL SPEED AND POWER STUFF IS SO LIGHT IT ALMOST REQUIRE BECAUSE ITS NON FATIGUING IT REQUIRES ALMOST KNOW ABOUT NO RECOVERY SO IF YOU WERE TRULY DOING SAY LIKE YOU KNOW YOU'LL WHEN YOU SAY YOUD IS FUNNY CAUSE WHEN YOU SAY I DO LEGS ON MONDAYS YOU DN'T EVEN REALIZE IT BUT AN ATLY DOES LEGS EVERY DAY BUT YOU'RE SAYING LEGS AND OU WAT YOU'RE REALLY SAYING AS I DO HIG PERCHAFY LEGS MONDAYS PRETTY MUCH THE I DONT WANT O GET INTO WHAT I DO SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE IT'S LESS IMPORTAN THAN WHAT OTHER PEOPLE CHOSE TO IMPLEMENT BUT THE REPETITION RANGES ANYWHERE FROM FOR TO TWELVE CORRECT SO AR SORA PRETTY E YOU'RE SMACK THAT IN THE PEAK SORNESS LONGEST RECOVERY RAIN VOLUME IS RELATIVELY LOW INTENSITY IS VERY VERY HIGH THEVVERECOUTS ARE VERY RY SO IF YOU WERE TO SWITCH THAT AND YOU WERE TO STAY UNDER FOUR REPETITIONS HIGHER QUALITY A HIGHER REST AND BETWEEN THEM I WOULD BE WILLING TO BET I LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY YOULD BE FINE THE NEXT DAY CERTAINLY FORTY HOURS AND IF YOU WERE O ACTUALLY GO WAYLOWER AND KEEP YO THREE TO FIVE KEEP IT VERY VERY LIGHT TRAIN FOR SPEED YOUWOULD HAVE ABSOLUTE NO ISSUE THE NEXT DAY SO IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO FUNCTION OF A TRAINING YOU'RE RIGHT IN THAT HYPERTRESON WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT YOU PROBABLY NEED FORTY HOURS AT MENIMUM TO RECOVER FROM BECAUSE WHAT YOU WON'T SEE AR BODY WILDERS TRAINING THE SAME MUSCELE GROUP ONMOULTIPLE DAYS LIKE VERY OFTEN AT MOST IT WOULD BE IN DIRECT BUT GENERALLY THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT EVERY SINGLE DAY FORTHE SAME REASON SO YOURE TRAINING IN THAT STYLE THAT'S WHAT IT'SGOING TO TAKE TO RECOVERY IF YOU TRAINED ANY DIFFERENT STYLE THEN IT WOULDN'T TAKE THAT LONG TO RECOVER SO FOR THE PERSONS STARTING OUT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND THEY PICK THREE TO FIVE EXERCISES AND STICK WITH THOSE  THAT THEY CAN GET THEIR SKILL AND MOVEMENT AND POSITIONING AND BREATHING ALL THAT REALLY DILED IN AND THEN START TO EXPERIMENT BY VERYING ONE OR TWO OF THOSE EXERCISES OVERTURN THAT'S GREAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE THE CONJUGAT MODEL SO THESE ARE THE THE STRONGEST POWER LIFTERS AS THE COLLECTIVE GROUP THAT EVER EXISTED UT BUT THEY'RE VERY GOOD AT US THEY KEEP ALMOST TH EXACTSING WEEKLY STRUCTURE BUT THEY MAKE A VERY SMALL CHANGE IN EXERCISE VARIATIONS SO FOR EXAMPLE SAY SAIN WEDNESDAY IS BENCH DAY RIGHT THEY'RE GOING TO ALWAYS BENCH ON WEDNESDAYS BUT MAYBE THIS WEEK THEY'R GET INTO CLOSE SCRIPT BEND AND THEN MAYBE NEXT WE COUTD SKON TO BE MAY BE A A AESPECIAL TYPE OF BARBELL THEN MAYBE THE WEEK AFTER THAT IT'S A YOU KNOW A MAYBE THE'LLCHANGE A RANGE O MOTION A LITTLE BIT SO IT'S ACTUALLY THE EXACT SAME EXERCISE WHER THE'RE MAKING A VERY SMALL VARIATION IN THAT CHANGE ALONE ALLOWS THEM TO DO ENOUGH SPECIFICITY BUT ALSO GIVES THEM ENOUGH VARIATION O WHEREIT'S NOT THE EXACT SAME STIMULI IN EXACT SAME SPOT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND THAT'S WHAT ALLOWS THAT GROUP PLUSS LOTS OF OTHER ASSISTANTS BUT IT'S WHAT ALLOWS THAT GROUP TO TRAIN VERY VERY VERY HEAVY VERY CONSISTENTLY NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT TOO MUCH PLANNING FOR PEARIZATION IN ANOTHER STUP LIKE THAT ATHEY GET THERE BACK OFF BY MAKING SMALL VARIATIONS AN EXERCISE I WILL SAY A MAJOR MISTAKE FOLKS DO MAKE IS THE CHANGE OUR EXERCISES ENTIRELY WAY TOO OFTEN M IF I WERE TO HAVE TO PICK ONE OR THE OTHER I WOULD SAY DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING IN YOUR EXERCISES FOR SIX WEEKS PROBABLY REALLYSIC MAYBE EVEN TEN THE TWELVE WEEKS AND THEN YOU CAN MAKE SOME CHANGES I YOU SHOULD NOT BE CHANGING EVERY SINGLE WEEK THE JURM UP YOU JUST YOUR NOT CO SEE PROGRESS IT'S CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT TO DO THAT SO IT'S GOING TO TAKE YOU THREE WEEKS GENERALLY TO FIGURE OUT THE GROUP OF THE EXERCISE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WELL YOU CAN LOAD IT WHAT'S TOO MUCH TO WHERE YOU WOKE UP UNBELIEVABLY SORE THAT WAS THE TRAIN WRECK IHOW MUCH DO I LOADED AT APPOSITION HLONGS TIS CONTIC IT'S CAN TAKE YOU THREE OR SO WEEKS AND THEN YOU CAN REALLY START PUSHING THERE SO CHANGING IT BEFORE THAT OR IN THAT TIME FRAME IS IS YOU'RE NOCK CAN BEABLE TO PROGRESSIVE LY OVERLOAD YOUUST KNOCK N NO EXACTLY WE ARE AT ON ALL THE EXERCISES SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO CREAT STANDARDIZATION WITHIN THEM AND THEN SEE SOME PROGRESS IN A MOVEMENT OR A MUSCLE GROUP WHATEVER YOU'RE GOING FOR AND THEN MAKE SOME CHANGES SO BEFORE WE DIVE INTO OURE DISCUSSION ABOUT HYPERTROPHY WE JUST GET A BRIEF RECAP OF THE GENERAL PRAMETERS FOR AN EXCELLENT POWER IN STRAINS STRAINING PROGRAM LOOK IT LET ME HIT YOU WIT THESE RAPID FIRE AND THKYING MAY BECOME ASKED QUESTIONS ALONG THAT REMEMBER THOSE MODIFIABLE VARIABLES I SO LET'S GO THO THEM AN ORDER AND WHAT THEY MEAN SPECIFICALLY FOR POWER FOR STRENGTH SO MODIFIABLE VARUABLE NUMBER ONE IS CALLED CHOICE SO WHICH EXERCISES DO I SELECT FOR STRENGTH IN GENAL FOR POWER OR SPEED OR STRENGTH WE WANT O SELECT COMPOUND MOVEMENTS YOU DON'T OFTEN SEE PEOPLE DOING MAXIM STRENGTH WORK FOR LIKE A TRYCEPT KICK BACK RIGHT IT'S TYPICALLY MOULTIPLE JOINT MOVEMENTS AND TYPICALLY COMPLEX I MOVEMENTS IN SELECTING THESE COMPOUND MOVEMENTS WE GENERALLY WANT ACTUALLY THING ABOUT EXRCISE SELECTION OF MOVEMENTS RATHER THAN MUSCLE GROUS THIS IS AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION BECAUSE WE' SEE THIS IS A DIFFERENT ANS WREN WE GET I PERCHAPY WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS WEN WE THINK ABOUT AGAIN STRENGTH TRANING WE TEND TO THINK ABOUT BODY BUILDING CONCEPTS WE GO TO THE GIM AND WE DO THINGS LIKE I GOT TO MAKE SURE I GET MY CHEST TO DAY AND I I I MAC STRAIN MY HAND STRINGS AND NOW YOU'R SELECTING EXERCISES BASED ON A MUSCLE YOU AN A WORK FOR STRENGTH DEVELOPMENT AND POWER WE WANT A THING ABOUT MOVEMENTS RATHER THAN INDIVIDUAL MUSCLE GROUP SO THERE SHOULD BE LIKE THINGS LIKE I NEED TO TRAIN EXPULSIVE HIPICTENSION WHICH IS LIKE A A A VERTICAL JUMP OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT II WANT A TRAIN PUSHING OR PULLING MOVEMENTS I WANT A TAIN ROAL TRICK I WANT A TRAIN ROTATION WHICH IS A WHOLE AREA WE HAVEN'T GOT INTO WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR ALL RAL HEALTH  WELL MIST LUNG EVITY SO WE WANT A SELECT BIG MOVEMENTS BY THE MUSCLE THE MOVEMENT PATTERNS TH WE WANT INTRODUCE AND WE JUST WANT SELECT A REASONABLE BALANCE BETWEEN THESE I DON'T CARE WHAT THE EXACT RATIO IS YOU JUST DON'T WANT TA GO IN ENTIRE SIX MONTHS WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING IN THIS ROTATIONAL AREA OR AN ENTIRE YO EIGHT TO TEN WEEKS WITHOUT DOING SOMETHING AM A WITH IT'S A LOWER BODY HINGE RIGHT SO ANY NUMBE OF EXAMPLES THERE SO JUST THINK ABOUT THE ROUGH MOVEMENT PATTERNS UPPER AND LOWER PUSH AND PULL AND THEN SOME SORT OF ROTATION THAT PUS YOUN A PRETTGOODSPOT IF YWERE USING THREE BY FIVE METHOD ANDYOU'RE GOING TO PICK AS LITTLE AS THREE EXERCISES JUST PICK ONE FROM EACH ONE OF THOSE GROUP PICK A ROTATION PICK A A PUSH A PICK APULL I CAN EASILY THINK OF A PUSHIN A PULL AM SO FOR EXAMPLEL A BENCH PRESSOR SHOULDER PRESS YOUR A ROW OR GIN FOR PULL AND THEN SQUAT OR DEAD LIT FOR A HINGE IT WHAT WOULD BE A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A QUALITY ROTATIONAL MOVEMENT YET SO ANY TIME A YOU CAN USE A CABLE MACHINEG LIKE GET THE GIM AND YOU CAN DO IT'S HOW A HAR TO DESCRIBE THIS EXERCISE BUT BASELY YO CAN TO STAND FACING ATHE CABLE AND YOU'RE GOING TO PULL IT TOWARD YOURSELF ANDTHEN ROTATE LIKE YOUR PIVITING LIKE ERE A EITHER SWINGING A GULF CLUB OR HITTING A BASEBALL BAT SO YOU'RE FACING ONE DIRECTION I'M FASING YOU RIGHT NOW I'M PULLING THE CABLE TOWARDS MYSELF AND THAT I'M IN A SPEN TO ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DEGREE PIVOT AND FACE EXACTLY AWAY FROM YOU WHAT I FINISH AND THEN RETURN IT BACK THAT SAME SPOT SO THAT'S A ROTATION WE ILL PROVIDE A LINK TO AN EXAMPLE OF THAT THEN YOU CONSIDER A QUALITY EXAMPLE I MEDICINE BALL THROW ANY NUMBER OF THINGS LIKE THIS  OUR GREAT ROTATIONAL EXERCISE RIGHT SO WE SELECTYOUR EXERCISES BASE ON THAT WE GENERALLY THEN ECATE BECAUSE THAT AS A CASE WE DON'T WORRY ABOUT THINGS LIKE ECENTRIC PURSES CONCENTRC BECASE YOU'RE GENALLY DOING A WHOLE BODY ATHLETIC MOVEMENT I WHICH THE ECENTRIC CONCENTIC PORTION IS GOING TO BE FOLDIT INTO THAT YOU REALLY CAN'T SEPARATE THEM OUT RIGHT SO THAT'S EXERCISE CHOICE OUR FIRST VERYBL THE NEXT ONE IS EXERCISE ORDER SO BECAUSE THAT EVERYTHING DRIVING POWER AND STRENGTH IS QUALITY BASED YOU WANT TO DO THESE AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR WORK OUT YOU WOULD NOT WANT TO DO ANYTHING FATIGUING BEFORE THIS SO NON PARTY OF ASCER TRAINING NO ATHER A RE PETITION TO FAIL YOUR STUFF IF YOU DO THOSE BEFORE AND NOW YOU'RE SLOWER ALL YOU'VE DONE IS PRACTICE GETTING SLOWER AND AND SO THESE NEED TO BE DONE WHEN YOU'RE FRESH YOU ALSO NEED TO DO THEM WHEN YOU'RE VERY FRESH BECAUSE THEY ARE THE MOST NEURLOGICALLY DEMANDING THEY'RE COMPLICATED THEY TEND TO HAVE MULTIPLE STEPS AND THE'RE OFTEN AND MULTIPLE PLANS AND COORDINATION IS A DIFFICULT THING AND IF YOU'RE TRYING TO DO ALL THAT A MAXIMUM SPEED YOU'RE NERVOUS EST AN EASY BE TREMEN SY FRESH  SO ANY AMOUN OF FATIGUE HERE IS ONLY GOING TO COMPROMISE RESULTS IM TO CINT A RECAP THAT ONEOF THE MAJOR MISTAKES WHEN TRAINING FOR STRENGTH AND ESPECIALLY POWER IS PEOPLE WERE WAY TOO MUCH ABOUT FATIGUE THOSE THINGS SHOULD NOT BE PART OF THE EQUATION IN FACT IF THEY ARE AT'S A VERY GOOD SIGN YOU'RE NT DOING THIS CORECT Y THESE ARE NON FATIGUING MOVEMENTS ESPECIALLY SPEED AND POWER SO CHOICE ORDER IS NEXT IM THE NEXT ONE AFTER THAT IS VOLUME AND WE SORT TO HIT VOLUME AND INTENSITY WHICH IS THE OTHER ONE IM WE T WE TALKED ABOUT THAT THE VOLUME IS BASELY IDENTICAL BETWEEN POWER AND STRENGTH  THE THE GENETLE NUMBER WERK TO LOOK OUT HERE IS SOMETHING LIKE THREE TO TWENTY SETS TOTAL PER WORK OUT BUR WORK OUT  BUT THAT WOULD BE LIKE TWENTY WOULD BE ABILITATIVE ESPECIAL CASE THREE TO FIVE S HN U TILL YOU EARLY EREGHTH I'M JUST SAYING LIKE SOMETIMES YOU CAN ACTUALLY GO QUITE HIGHER IN SCASEIS BUT THAT'S THE GENERAL RENGTH AND ONE SOMEBODY FINISHES THE THREE BY FIVE WORK OUT FOR POWER OR STRENGTH IF THEY DECIDE THEY WANT TO THROW IN SOME CAPRASES AND CURLS AND TOTALLY O FOREARM WORK OR A LITTLE BIT OF A JOGGY ON THE TREADMILL ER SOMETHING THAT'S O K ABSOLUTELY THAT THERE IS YOUR VERY LITTLE RISK OF INTERFERENCE FOR THINGS LIKE SPEED AND POWER STRENGTH YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF RISK ONLY BECAUSE NOW YOU'RE INTRODUCING FATIGUE WHICH IF YOURE REALLY PUSHING STRENGTH THAT MIGHT COMPROMISE RECOVERY AH I COULD IMAGINE DOING THE THREE TO FIVE ROUTINE FOR STRENGTH OR FOR POWER AND THEN SOMEBODY FINISHING UP WITH IM TEN OR FIFTEEN MINUTES OF HYPERTURE FORY ARM WORK AND THEN BEING VERY SERIOUSLY COMPROMISE IF THEY TRY ND COME IN TE NEXT DAY OR EVEN THE NEXT DAY CORRECT AND DO THOSE BIG COMPOUND MOVEMENTS FOR SPEED AND POWER THAT'S RI NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE SORE BUT THE MUSCLES MAY ACTUALLY STILL BE DAMAGE AND I KNOW LATER WERE IN TALK ABOUT AV THE IM SOMEWHAT TEN YOUOUS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SORENESS AND RECOVERY YET SO THAT THAT'S A HAT'S A REALLY NICE A HURISTIC  TO PAY ATTENTION TO IS YOU CAN BUT JUST BE CAREFUL ENERGY STARTS TA MATTER AT THAT POINT IM IF YOU'RE REALLY TRULY TRYING TO MAX MY STRNGTH YOU WOULD DO NOTHING AT ALL OUTSIDE THAT TRAIN I IF YOU JUST LIKE A KON OWON TO GET STRONGER AND SOME OTHER THINGS AND YOU'RE WILLING TO LOSE STRENGTH IN FIVE PERCENT OF YOUR STRENGTH GAINGS THEN YOU'RE YOU'RE TOTALLY FINE I'M THE SAME CAN BE SAID BY THE WAY FOR SUPERSETINGH SO SUPERSEDING IS AN IDEA THAT SAYS LIKE WAIT A MINUTE YOU'RE TELLING ME DO I GOT O TAKE FIVE MINUTES IN BETWEEN EACH SET THAT'S NOT SO MUCH A PROMNAT IS WITH PON OO YOS MARTPHONES BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE FILLING THEIR INTERSET INTERVALS WITH SOCIAL MEDIA IN TAXT IN CORRECT YOU YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE TO GO THAT LONG IN FACT THERE WAS ACTUALLY A STUDY THAT CAME OUT IN H LAST MONTH AT SHOWED YOUNO LIKE REALLY TWO MINUTES IS PROBABLY SUFFICIENT FOR MOST PEOPLE HAVING SAID THAT IF YOURE REALLY ARE TRYING TO PUSH MAXIMAL STRENGTH ADAPTATIONS LIKE THREE TO FIVE IS VERY VERY REASONABLE IM YOUR THOSE TRAIN SESSIONS ARE LONG CUD YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR SPENDING MORE TIME NOT DOING ANYTHING THEN YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING BUT YOU'RE TRYING TO MAXIMISS QUALITY SO THAT'S A SORT LIKE PART IN PARCEL IF YOU'RE NOT SUPERWORIED ABOUT IT YOU CAN ACTUAL DO SUPERSETTING WHICH IS LET'S IMAGING AGAIN YOU'REGOING TO DO SOME SOME LUNGES AND WHY YOUR LEGS ARE RESTING DOING THEIR THREE TO FIVE MINUTES YOU CAN GO OVER AND DO AN UPPER BODY ROW OR PULL WHEN YOUR UPPER BODY'S RESTING YOU'RE GOING BACK TO LEGS SO THAT REALLY CUTS YOUR TIME AND HALF IS IT IDEAL NO WE ACTUAY RAND A STUDY A MAY BE TEN YEARS AGO ON OUR LAP AND WE LOOK TO THAT SPECIFICALLY AND WE DID SEE A REDUCTION IN STRENGTH PERFORMANCE IN THE SUPERSCETTING GROUP RELATIVE TO THE GROUP WHO DO NOT SUPERSET THE QUESTION THEN IT BECOMES LIKE ISN'T ENOUGH FOR YOU TO CARE SO IF YOU ERE IF AR TO SAY HAY I CAN CUT AN HOUR OFF OF YOUR WORK OUT TIME BUT YOU WILL LOSE FIVE PERCENT OF YOUR STRENGTH GAIN ALMOST EVERY ONE WOULD TAKE THAT EXCHANGE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF PEOPLE WERE GEING CLOSE TO COMPETITION OR REALLY TRYING TO SET A NEW LIFETIME P OUR SOMETHINGTHEN YOU MIGHT SAY NO I DON'T WANT ANY INTERFERENCE THERE THAT LAST LITTLE MARGIN IS WHAT I CARE ABOUT GIVE ME THE EXTRA REST GRAT SO IT'S NOT A DOES IT WORK DOES AT NOUT WORK IT'S ALWAYS A WHAT YOU WILLING TO GIVE UP A PERS ISGAT THE PRACTICALITIES OF SUPERSEDIN YOUR STAGGERING PUSHPOL PUSHPOOL IN MY MIND ARE REAL BECAUSE YOU YOUHAVE TO TAKE OVER LARGE SAGMENTS OF THE GIM WHICH OFTEN TIMES LEADS YO A SITUATION WHERE YOUR REST TIMES ARE TOO LONG OR HIGHLY VARIABLE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE WORKING IN OR YOU CAN'T FINISH YOUR SET CUS SOUND SOME ONE JUMPED IN TO THE MACHINE RIGT TOTALS CREUSE THREE OR FIVE OF YOUR FRIENDS  BECAUSE IT'S OBNOXIOUS WHEN YOU'RE TAKING OVER ALL THE EQUIPMENT BUT IN ALL SERIOUSNESS I THINK M IT'S WONDERFUL IF YOU HAVE THE SPACE IN IN THE FORM AT TO DO IT BUT AT LEAST IN MY EXPERIENCE AND OBSERVATION OM THESE PEOPLE KNOW WHO THEY ARE IT'S NOT PRACTICAL TO DO ON A REGULAR BASIS IF YOU TRAIN IN OPEN COMMERCIAL GIM YET TUFT UPOL OP SO IM WE'VE COVERED CHOICE ORDER VOLUME AN INTENSITY TO A SUFFICIENT LEVEL THE LAST ONE IS FREQUENCY AND WE'VE ORTY SORT OF INDIRECTLY TALKED ABOUT THA WERE FREQUENCY CAN BE AS HIGH AS YOU LIKE IN THIS AREA IT REALLY DEPENDS ON YOUR RECOVERY IF YOU REALLY TRULY PUSHING MAXIMUM STRENGTH YOU PROBABLY DO NEED IF YOU DAYS TO RECOVER ALTHOUGH THAT'S DEPENDED UPON YOU BUT S BEEN POWER CAN BE DONE MULTIPLIMES AT AY ALMOST EVERY DAY BASICALLY ITHE ONE EXCEPTION WOULD BE MAXIMUL SPRINTING SPEED YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL THERE FOR THINGS LIKE HAM STRAIN I NEAN URY SPECIALLY FOUR PRETTY FAST SO YOU WANT TO BE LITTLE BET CAUTIOUS THAT BUT IF YOU DOING EASIER MOVEMENTS I'M LIKE MEDICINE BALL THROWS OR CANDABALL SWINGS OR SOMETHING YOU CAN DO THOSE QUITE OFTEN AS LONG AS THE VOLUME IS IS STANK PRETTY LOW LAST LITTLE PIECE HERE IS PROGRESSION HOW I PROGESS OVER TIME SO I MENTION THITS EARLIER BUT JUST WANT TO FILL THIS GAP RIGHT BACK AGAIN BEFORE WE HAD OVER TO IPARTRY WHICH IS THREE TO FIVE PER CENT INCREASE PER WEEK OF INTENSITY IN GENERAL AND YOU CAN DO UPWARDS OF ABOUT FIVE PER CENT INCREASIN VOLUME PER WEEK OVER TIME AND I GENERALLY RECOMMEND RUNNING THAT FOR AT LONGEST EIGHT WEEKS BUT PROBABLY MOST REALISTICALLY YOU WANT TO GO ABOUT FIVE WEEK OR SO AND THEN HAVE SOME SORT OF A DEELOAD OR BACK OFF WEEK IF YOU DO THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE GENTLLY GETTOG ME A PRETTY GOOD SPOT M SO THOSE ARE LIKE THE COR CONCEPTS NOWP THERE'S A WHOLE WANCH OF FON METHODS YOU CAN PLAY IT WITH WITHIN ALL THESE CATEGORIES AND AND I I WOULD LIKE TO ACTION COVER JUST COUPLE OF EM I IF WE'VE GOT A LITTLE MORE SPACE FOR THAT SURE I'D LEVE TO HERE ABOUT THOSE I'D LIKE TO ALSO JUST CUE UP ONE WHICH IS WELE I JOKED ABOUT PEOPLE TEXTING AND DOING SOCIAL MEDIA BETWEEN SETS I IT'S NOT A JOKE I WELL I CONFESS I STOP BRINGING MY PHONE INTO THE JIM IM BECAUSE OF THE URGE TO YOU N' TAKE MY MIND OFF OR THE WORK OUT AND I JUST STARTED EN JOYING MY WORK OUTS A LOT MORE YEAND THEY WORK OUTS GO FAR BETTER THAT WAY AND THEREN'T THERE JUST MUCH MORE EFFICIENT IT FOR ME I I REALIZE THAT SOME PEOPLE THEIR CAREERS TAKE PLACE IN THE GEMM AN SO FOR THE I DON'T UM LOOK DOWN UPON ANY ONE USING THEIR PHONE AT THE GIM BUT THAT REALLY TENDS TO HELP U ME BUT I DO WONDER WHETHER NOT THERE'S AN OPTIMOL BEHAV YOUR OR MIN SET IN BETWEEN SETS  IM I'VE HEARD BEFORE THAT PACING AROUND CAN ACTUALLY HELP DIFFUSE SOME OF THE LACK TAGUE AND OTHER METABOLIC A BY PRODUCTS OF OF WORK IN EXERTION YE THAT CAN LEAD TO BETTER PERFORMANCE I'VE ALSO HEARD THAT UM YOU KNOW SHAKING THE MUSCLES OUT AND THERE'S ALL SORTS OF GIM LORE UM ABOUT THIS BUT MAYBETHERE'S ALSO SOME DECENT SCIENCE SOME JUST CURIOUS A IF YOU HAVE ANY SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS THAT PEOPLE COULD PLAY WITH OR TRYIG YET SO FR FOR SPEED AND POWER I YOU WANT TO WALK THIS BALANCE OF STIFF AND BUT FRESH AND SO IF YOURE  LITERALLY FINISH OUR REPETITION SIT ON A BENCH FOR FIVE MINUTES YOU WOULD STAND UP AFTER THAT FAIRLY STIFF AND YOU WOULDN'T FEEL SO RISM THIS IS ALL SI THIS IS ALL NON SCIENCES IS ALL PRACT O APPLICATION RIGHT ANE CADATA ANECDAT GA STRENGTH IS LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BUT THI'S THE SAME CONCEPT YOU'RE WALKING THAT LINE I IN GENERAL A LOT OF THE TIMES IF YOU SEE POWER LIFTERS WE LIFTERS AND BETWEEN SETS THEYRE GOING TO SIT DOWN A NOT MOVE FOR I PRORCH IF YOU CAN' BE LITTLE A DIFFERENT BECAUSE YOU'RE ETTNG TOWARDS FATIGUE AND SO THE FACTORS YOU MENTION LIKE CLEARING LAC TEY WILL FIRST TO AL LACKTATE IS NOT ACTUALLY CAUSING FATIGUE THAT'S THAT'S A GIANT MYTHLL WHICH IS WHY I TEATED UP NOIJUS IM BUT IN THE CASE OF AGAINST MEN OWR YOU NOT GOING TO FATIGUE SO FATIGUE MENIGEMENTS ON A REALLY AN ISSUE YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE GETTING COMPLETE NOUR LOGICAL RECOVERY WHICH IS LITTLE BIT SLOWER THEN MUSCLE  ENERGETICALLY YOU'R NOT OUT OF ANY GAS WHATSOEVER RIGHT IM YOU ARE NOT A LACK OF FUEL YOU 'RE DOING THREE REPETITIONS OF A FERCLE JOHMP YE NO CLANYOF LIKE AGIN TOTALLY WHAT ABOUT STRETCHING BETWEEN SETS YET YOU PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO DO THAT EITHER I THERE ARE VERY CLEAR EXAMPLES OF PRE EXERCISE STRETCHING STATIC STRETCHING  BEEN QUITE DETRIMENTAL FOR MAXIMUM POWER PRODUCTION THE SAME THING FOR SPEED I AN STRENGTH AND THAT'S BEEN SHOWN ACTUALLY A NUMBER OF TIMES IN A NUMBER OF LABORATORIES WHICH IS LIKE A A CLASS IC HALL MARK ANY SCIENCTIS LOOKS FOR IF I REALLY JUMPING ON BOARD ITH AN IDEA IF I SHOWN NOT ONLY MULTIPLE TIMES BUT IN MULTIPLE LABORATORIES FROR MULTIPLE SCIENTISTS AND THEYRE ALL SEEING THE SAME THING YE STARE TO ET A LOT O CONFITDENCE THAT THAT'S REAL FINDING AND THAT'S BEEN SHOWN  WE'VE DONE THAT N AR SENT ER FOR SPORE PERFORMANCE NOT MYSELF BUT ONE OF MY COLEGUES HAS DONE ABOUT STRETCHING RESEARCHING HE SEEN THAT A LOT ON EVERYTHING FROM VERTICAL JOMP I'M TO ICCONETICTINAMOMETERS AND ENFORCE PVELOCITY CURVES AND THERE'S WE WE SEENG THIS IS PRINTING WE'VE SEEN THIS AN SPEED WE SEEN THIS AND LOADED STUFFSO I YO YOU DON'T WANT A SPEND A TON OF TIMES STRETCHING STATICALLY STRETCHING A MUSCLE PRIETRIC IF YOU DO THAT AN YOU HAVE O DO THAT SAY SAFE FOR EXAMPLE YOU FINISH TAT YOUE UST LIKE FEELING REALLY TIGHT YET GO HEAD TT YOU NEED TO GET THERIGHT POSITION ESPECIALLY FROR MOST PEOPLE WHERE ARE YOU WILLING TO SACRIFICE TEN PER CENT A POWER TO MAKE SRE YOUDON'T GET HURT YES THAT ANSWERIS ALMOST ALWAYS YES OUTSIDE OF SOME VERY SPECIFIC ATLES CENARIOS SO IF YOU'RE NOT IN THE RIGHT POSITION I ACTUALLY REMBER HAVING THIS CONVERSATION WITH KELLY  CALLI START A LONG TIME AGO ITS IS LIKE YET FINE I'LL LOSE FIVE PER CENT THAT MEANS I'M NOT GOING TO GET IN A BAD POSITION AND HURT MY BACK I AND I TOTALLY TOTALLY AGREE SO IF YOU GOT OPENG UP A HIP OR AN ANKLE OR SOMETHING TO GET THERE GET IN THE RIGHT POSITION NEVER ONE WE'LL LIVE WITH THE FIVE PER CENT REDUCTION AND POWER AND IF YOU DO JUST REACTIVATE SO BEFORE YOU O O YOUR WORKING SET GO DO SOMETHING FAST AGAIN A VERTICAL JUMP A SHORT SPRINT AN EXCELERATION AND SORT O GET THAT SYSTEM CLEARED BACK UP I'M IF YOU DIDN'T STRETCH IT FOR LONG ENOUGH YU DIDN'T HOLD A FRLONG ENOUGH YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE JUST FINE SO'WHEN IT COMES OI PERTUVE Y CAN REALY STRETCHAL WE WANT COURE NOT IT'S NOT DRIVEN BY INTENSITY OR OUTCOME ITS BEING DRIVEN BY AN INSULT INTO THE TISSUE AND SO IF YOU'RE PRE FATIGUE FOR I PERCHY IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE PRESTRETCHED THAT DOESN'T MATTER WE'RE NOT GOING FOR QUALITY OF OUTCOME ORE GOING FOR QUALITY OF INTERNAL SIGNAL WHICH IS NOT GOING TO BE AM CHANGED BY YOUR FORCE OUT BUT SO IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER YOU MENTION A FEW OTHER THINGS THAT ONE MIGHT CONSIDER YET AN IN LIGHT OF A THE ELIST THAT YOU PROVIDED OF CHOICE ORDER VOLUME FREQUENCY AND PROGRESSION RIGHT SO STARTING OFF WITH POWER JUST WANTE TA HAND THE THE LISTENERS SURE WITH A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT METHODS TO CO PLIGHT WITH SO'S LONG AS YOU GET THOSE CONCEPTS THE REPETITION RANGE FOR POWER THORTY TO SEVENTY PERCENT OF YOUR ONE OR PETITION MACTS DEPENDING ON THE EXERCISE AND YOUR TRAINING STATUS 'M YOU'RE YOU'RE ONGTO GET POWER LONG AS OU'R TEMPTING TO GO FAST IS IMIC GREY A LOT OF THINGS YOU CAN TRY CLI METRICS ARE OUR GREAT EXAMPLE IM OF THINGS THATER EFFECTIVE FOR IM FOR POWER DEVELOPMENT WEE'VE MENTIOND MEDICINE BALL THROWS A SHORT PRIENDS YOU CAN EVEN DO SPRIENDS UNLIKE AN AIR BIKE WHICH IS A GREAT SUPERSAFE ACTIVITY YOU CAN DO THEM FROM LIKE A ROLLING START WHER YOU CAN O I GET GOING A LITTLE BED AND THEN YOU EXPLODE FOR FIVE SECONDS TO SEE A FAST YOUN GET OR A DEAD START LIKE BOTH OF THOSE ARE VERY RACCEPTABLE I'M WAIHT LIFTING MOVEMENTS O SNATCHES IN CLINGING JERKS ARE TREMENDOUSLY EFFECT OF IN FACT THEY ARE POUND FOR POUND BY FAR THE MOST EFFECTIVE A EXERCISE CHOICE FOR POWER DEVELOPMENT WITHOUT QUESTION I'MSO THOSE ARE GOOD ONES CLAPPING PUSHUPS BEED SQUATS THESE THERE ALL WHOLE WHOST OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO FORSPEED AND POWER DEVELOPMENT I'M DEPENDING ON YOUR A KETTABELL SWINGS ANOTHER GREAT ONE I'M ALL THESE CAN BE DONE DEPENDING ON YOUR PREFERENCE EXERCISE OF ILLABILITY WHAT'S THAT YOUR GEM OR NOT GEM ANY THOSE THINGS IF SOMEBODY IS MORTROKEST ON STRENGTH AS OPPOSED TO POWER WHAT ARE THE ADDITIONAL VARIABLES THEY SHOULD CONSIDER AGAIN WITHIN THE CONTECT OF THIS OVERARCHING THEME OF CHOICE ORDER VOLUME FREQUENCY AN PROGRESSION ABSOLUTELY IT'S ALMOST IDENTICAL WITH A COUPLE OF SMALL EXCEPTIONS SUMBER ONE YOU PROBABLY CAN'T DO THERE'S MANY WORKING SETS PER WEEK FOR STRENGTH BECAUSE NOW YOUR INTRODUCING A HEAVIER LOAD AND ASK IN TO REPRESENT SOME SORT OF FATIGUE I LOAD ON THE TISSUE ALL THOSE THINGS SO YOU COULD PROBABLY GET AWAY WITH DOING TWENTY SETS OF TWO OF A VERTICAL JUMP FOUR FIVE TIMES A WEK YOU PROBABLY COULDN'T DO THAT AT A NINETY PER CENT ON SQUAT RIGHT SO THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF SETS IN THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF WEEKLY LOAD YOU CAN GET TO JUST NEEDS TO BE LOWER AND THEN THE INTENSITY RIGTS WE TALKED ABOUT THAT NEEDS TO BE GENERALLY HIGHER THAN SEVENTY PER CENT WITH NOW SOME PORTION OTHOUT BEING WORKING SETS OF SOME PORTI OF THAT REALLY TRULY BEING AT NINETY PER CENT PLUSS EVERTHING ELSE IT IS PRETTY IDENTICAL YOUVE STILL ONE EMPHASISE MAXIMUM SPEED DESPITE THE FACT YOU MAY ACTUALLY NOT BE MOVING FASTER BECAUSE YOU'VE INTRODUCE LOAD YOU STILL NEED TO BE ATTEMPTING THAT BUT YOU'RE GONGTO BE PICKING COMPLEX EXERCISES YOU'RE GENERALLY GOING TO BE HEDGING MORE TOARDS BARBELLS IN MACHINES SO THIS IS A CASE WHERE A BODY WEIGHT TRAINING CAN BE EFFECTIVE AGAIN PERTICULARY FOR THE UPPER BODY BUT AT SOME POINT YOU'RE REALLY GN A HAVE TO MOVE PASS THAT BECAUSE THERE'S JUST A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF LOAD YOU CAN'T PUT ON THE LOWER BODY WITH JUST YOUR BODYWAY YOU GET LIMITED BY HOW MUCH YOU WAY OR A THERE'S A COUPLE O THINGS YOU CAN DO BUT YOU'RE GET A RUN OUT PASS THAT PRETTY QUICKLY AND SO INSWHEN IT COMES TO STRAINT THEY TEND TO BE LESS ATHLETIC MOVEMENTS BECAUSE I MEAN WE HAVE TO HAVE A BARBELL ON US WE HAVE TO HAVE A WEFE TO BE ON A MACHINE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND SO THAT'S A SUBTLE DIFFERENCE AND EXERCISE CHOICE WE NEED TO ALSO BE CAREFUL ABOUT THE ECENTRIC PORTION AND THINGS LIKE THAT WE DON'T HAVE AS MUCH RISK IN AN THE COSPEDER POWER ONE SO I'M SOME O THE DIFERENTHINGS YOU CAN PLAY WITH THERE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT DOING THINGS LIKE PUSHES AND PULLS I ALSO LOVE CARRIES SO A FARMERS CARRY I PUSHING A SLED DRAGGING A SLED ALL KINDS TOT THING A YOLK LOCK ALL KINDS OF OF CARRY MODALITIES THAT ARE VERY VERY EFFECTIVE AT FOR STRENGTH IM THERE'S ECENTRIC OVERLOAD TRAINING WHICH WE REALLY HAVEN'T GOT INTO BUT IT'S REALLY ADVANCE TECHNIC WYOU CAN ACTUALLY LOAD AT GREATER THAN ONE HUNDRED PER CENT OF YOUR ONE REPETITION MAX BUT YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO DO THE ECENTRIC PORTION OF IT I'M SO PHYSIOLOGICALLY YOU ARE MUCH STRONGER ECENTRICALLY THAN YOUR CONCENTRICALLY I'M FOR A VARIETY OF OF A MUSCLE TISSUE REASONS ACTUALLY AND SO IMAGINE IF YOU CAN DO A BENCH PRESS AT TWO HUNDRED POUNDS I'M WHAT YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY DOS LOADIT TO TWO HUNDRED TWENTY AND YOU WOULD HAVE A SPOTTER AND AND MAYBE EVEN USE IT IN A RACK AND YOU WOULD LOWER IT DOWN UNDER CONTROL ALLTHEWAY TO THE BOTTOM AND THEN STOP YOUR FRIENDS WOULD LIFT O BACK UP THE TOP AND YOU JUST PRACTICE TAT EASCENTRIC PORTION YOU WOULD ACTUALLY GE O THE LOWER SAY TO IT OR TWENTY POUNDS EFFECTIVELY DESPITE THE FACT THAT YOU WOULDN'T AVE AIL TO LIFT TO BACK UP YOU DON'T NEED TO START THERE BUT THAT IS A VERY EFFECTIVE METHOD I FOR INCRET IN FACT ARGUE  ONE OF I A ON OF MY DOCTRIN SOON STRAINT NOW AS IS DOING A PROJECT ON THE SET YOU  SEE AND HE A LIKE ESE FOLKS IN DIRECTLY ON THI IN ITS IT IT'S QUITE CLEAR THIS OFTEN TIMES MORE EFFECTIVE ITSTRENGTH DEVELOPMENTHAN ANYTHING ELSE COUSD YOU CAN ACTUALLY JUST LIKE IN TH SPEED EXAMPLE WERE YOU WANT ACTUAL PRACTICE MOVING FASTER SO INSTEAD OF PRACTICING AN A HUNDRED PER CENT OF YOUR ON OR MACTRA STRAINGTH YOU ACT YOUR PRACTICE SET HIRE N A TO GET BETTER AT IT SO THAT'S THAT'S ANOTHER A MUCH MORE ADVANCE TO PLEASE DON'T LET ME GET SUED BY SAYING I FOLKS BE CAREFUL MAKE YOUR DOING THE PROPER EXERCISE IN YOUR POSITION AND AND I CAVYOT CAVYAT CAVYOT KE BUT OUTSIDE OF THAT IT CAN BE IS ITS TOLY FINE AND SAY YET WITH IT WHEN PEOBLE GET INJURED THEY CAN'T TRAIN OUCAN'T TRAIN YOU DON'T PREGRESS TO YOU LOSE PROGRESS SO A CERTAINLY THAT THAT'S WORTH I LETTIN SO TWO MORE A LITTLE MORE O VASTAC NEETS THAT THAT ONT THROUGHOUT THERE AND ONE OF TEM IS CALLED CLUSTER SETS SO CLUSTER SETS ARE THERE'S A BUNCH AWAYS TO DO IT BUT IMAGINE TAKING A MANY BRAK AND BETWEEN EVERY SINGLE REPETITION SO SAYOU CAN TO DO FIVE REPETITIONS OR INTERRUPT BUT YOU'RE ACTUONING TO DOS DO ONE REPETITION SET IT DOWN PAS FOR FIVE TO TEN SECONDS AND THEN DO THE NEXT ONE PAUS DO THE NEXT ONE PAUSPASPASSPASSPASS SE YOU CAN IMAGINE DOING LIKE A SQUAT AND YOUGHT A GO DOWN EXPLODE UP YOU'RE STANDING IT A RACK IT OUT YOU A CANNOT I SHAKE BACK OUT CAT YOUR BREATH WALK BACK AIN DO ANOTHER ONE RACK IT OUT ANDYOU' REPEAT THAT UNTILL YOU'VE EXECUTED YOUR THREE OR FOUR OR FIVE REPTITIONS AND THEN YOU TAKE YOUR THREE TO FIVE MIN A BREAK BEFORE YOUR NEXT SET THAT IS AN INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE WAY FOR BOTH STRENGTH POWER AND ACTUALLYEVEN HIGH PERTRIPY BECAUSE YOU CAN KEEP THE QUALITY THE FOURCE OUTPUT THE POWER OU BUT VERY VERY VERY HIGH CAUSE YOU'REGETTING THIS LITTLE MANY BREAKS AND YOU'RE NOT GETTING FATIGUE SETTING IN BY THE TIMEYOU YOUR SAY THIRD OR FOURTH OR FIFTH RE PETITION IN THAT SET MAFTER REPETITION ONE YOU STRART TO SEE VERY SMALL SUBTLE REDUCTIONS POWER OUP BUT BECAUE YOU START TO SEE A LITTLE BIN FATIGUE YOU YOU TAKE THOSE FIVE TO TEN SECONDS OFF EVEN UP TO TWENTY SECONDS YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO IT MYOU DON'T SEE ANY DROP AND AN FOURCE OUT PUT OVER THE COURSE OF THE FIVE AND SO WHAT YOU REALLY HAVE DONE IS YOU'VE GOT IN FIVE IN THIS EXAMPLE FIRST REPETITIONS WHICH IS THE WAYTHE WE CANNA SAYORA SO ALL FIVE OF THOSE HAD THE SAME QUALITY AS RAPTEMBERJUANT WHICH IS AGAIN AS WRE TALKING THAT'S THE DRIVER AN STRAINGTH AND SO THAT'S THE ONE WE WNT TO PRESERVE SO IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT LONGER FOR SOME EXERCISE ITS NOT VERY GOOD IT'S GRATE FOR LIKE A DEDLIFT CAN YOU SET ABACK DOWN CHAKE A BACK OUT REGRIP HARD TO DO WITH THE BENCH YOU GET A RERACK IT BACK IN THAN RE RACK A BACK OUT THAT'S IT'S A KIND OF A PANMEN THE ASS  SO THERE'S SOME EXERCISES IT DOESN'T WORK WELL WITH AND AND SONE THAT TO THAT SPET I CLUSTER SETS IAND THE LOT A RESEARCH ON THOSE I VERY FECTIVE WOULD YOU RECOMMEND THE SOMEBODY'S DOING CLUSTER SETS TA THEY DO THEM FOR EVERY SESSION WITHIN THAT WEAK OR JUS TISIS EM OCCASIONAL YOU CAN DO IT THE DE THIS COUL E YOUR TRAINING STRATEDY YE ABSOLUTELY SO YOU CAN REALLY TAKE IT THAT SERIOUS AM IN FACT LIKE IF YOU LOOK AT AGAIN THE WAYLIFTERS HEY WILL DO CLUSTER SETS BY DEFAULT NOT EVEN TRYING STILL SAY THEYLL DO LIKE A CLEAN AND THETHER DROP THE WAIY BACK OUT THERE' SUPOST TO BE DOING SAY A SET AF THREE BUT ALMOST ALWAYS THEY'RE GON LIKE SHAKE IT OUT REGRIP ANDTHE PULL IT AGAIN AND SOMETIMES THEYRE SET A THREE TAKES LIKE A MINUTE AND THEN IT'S LIKE YE HEARS FUN INK PSYKCE ILIC AND I SET A TRUT A TRIPLE PEAR OU LIKE NO YOU DID THREE SINGLES COULSIT IF IS Y DOING THREE SINGLES AN AS SAT AF THREE WHEN YOU TOOK A MINUTE BETWEEN THESE RAP IM ILOW THAT COMMUNITY SO YET A MAKE CAP YOUR TRATEGY LIKE IT COULD BE LIKE HAY FOR THIS FIVE WEEK BLOCK THIS IS ALL MY TRAINING ESPECIALY FOR YOUR COMPOUND MOVEMENTS IF YOUEGIG TO GO TO START DOING SOME THE SMALLER MOVEMENTS MAYBE YOU GIVE UP ON THAT IIT COULD ALSO JUST BE SOMETHING YOU DO FOR YOUR ONE PRIMARY EXERCISE FOR THE DAY SO DO THAT THING THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FIRST AND JUST DO IT FOR THAT ONE AND THE REST OF HEM YOU CAN CONDICHET IF YOU NEED TO SAVE LITTLE BY THAT TIME IIT COLD ALSO BE SOMETHING OU DO BY FEEL SO YOYOURE YOUR TWO REPS INYGO KILIC AM NOT FEELING LIKE COPY HERE LIKE RERACK IT CATCS A REST FOR QUICK SECOND AND DO IT SO DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ULTRA PLAN II GUESS WHAT I'M DOING IS IS I'M GIVING YOU AN EXCUSE TO MAKE SURE YOUR SUPERFRESH FOR EVERY REP IT MATTERS THE LAST ONE I WANT O TALK ABOUT HERE IS WHAT'S CALLED DYNAMIC VARIABLE RESISTANCE SO DYAMIC VARIABLE RESISTANCE IS I FIXING THE PROBLEM WE HAVE WITHAS CALLED THE HUMAN STRENGTH CURVE SO THE ARY OF CONSTRAINTS AGAIN YOUARE ONLY AS STRONG AS YOU AR IN YOUR WEAKEST POINT OF A MOVEMENT SO DEPENDING ON THE THE MOVEMENT YOU DO THIS HAPPENS AT A DIFFERENT RANGE OF MOTION WELL THE DEADLE DISEASIS EXAMPLE IMIT'S ALSO BECAUSE WE'VE DONE LIKE RESEARCH IN MY LAB USING THIS STUFF ON THE DEDLE SO I CAN SPEAK TO VERY DIRECTLY WHEN YOU GO TO PULL IT OFF THE GROUND SOME PEOPLE ARE IN A FAIL REGHT AT THE BOTTOM MEAN THEY WON'T GET THE WEIGHT OFFTHE GROUND D ALL SOME PEOPLE WI FELL JUST BELOW THE KNEESE THAT'S LYCHALLY CAN COME LIKE THE HARDEST TRANSITION PERIOD AND AT SOME PEOPLE WILL FILL RIGHT AT THE TOP JUST BEFORE THEY CAN LOCK OUT O KAT GRAGT SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS AT SOME POINT OF THAT LIFT YOU'RE GOING TO ONLY BE LIMITED BY YOUR STRENGTH IN THE WEAKEST AREA RIGHT SO IF YOU HAVE A CONSTANT LOAD ON THE BAR IN THOSE OTHER TWO PARTS THE RANGE OF MOTION WOR YOU ARE NOT THE WEAKEST THEY'RE NEVER TRULY BEING TESTED FOR THEIR MAXIM OF STRENGTH CAUS HE'RE ALWAYS BEING LIMITED BY THE PREVIOUSLY THIS IS THE SAME ARGUMENT THAT WE WOULD GET INTO IF PEOPLE ASK ABOUT SHOULD WHAT A WEYOU THINK ABOUT USINGE STRAPS RIGHT 'M ISSTRAPPING YUR HAND TO A BAR FOR DEADLES THINGS LIKE THAT THERE'S PROSEAN CONSER THERR TIMES WHEN YOU WANT TO USE THI STRAP AN THEIR TIMES WHEN IT'S A BAD IDEA SO WHAT DYNAMIC VARIABLE RESISTANCEES IS EITHER USING THINGS LIKE A HEAVY BAND OR A OR CHAINS ON THE BAR IFER SEE PEOPLE DO THAT I'M SO IN MY LAB WE ACTU HAVE A FORCE PLATE ON THE GROUND AND TH WE HAVE I BUILT IN A BISKELY HOOKS I'M THE FRONT THE BACK SO WE CAN ACTUALLY SET A A BARBELL ON TOP OF THE FORCE PLATE WHERE YOU STAND ON IT AND THEN RUN BANDS FROM THE BACK TO THE FRONT RUNNING OVER TOP OF THE WEIGHTS AND SO WHEN YOU STAND UP AS YOU'R GOING UP VERTICALLY THE BANDS ARE ETTING TIGHTER AND TIGHTER AND PULLING THE WEIGHT TOWARDS THE GROUND SO THE WEIGHT IS GETTING HEAVIER AND HEAVIER AS YOU STAND UP SO AS YOU START TO GAIN MECHANICAL ADVANTAGE AND YOUR POSITIONING YOU START TO INCREASE LOAD CAUSE THE BANDS ARE GTTING TIGHTER AND TIHTER AND TIGHTER SO'S A LOWS YOU TO TRAIN THAT FULL PART OF THE STRENGTH CURVE AND A CHALLENGE AM YOUR STRONGER AIRY IS WITH HAVE YOUR WEIGHT AND YOU'R WEAKER ARY IS WITH LOWER WEIGHT I'M YOU CAN DO THE SAME THING WITH A BENCH PRESS YOU CAN DO IT WITH A A SQUAT IN ANY OTHER EXERCISED VARIATION AND DIAM IC VARIABLE RESISTANCE I IS INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE FOR A NUMBER OF THINGS I'M YOURE GOING TO GIVE UP A LITTLE BIT I'M BECAUSE THE TOTAL LOAD YOU CAN PUT ON THE BAR BELL IS LOWER BECAUE YOUE CAN BE ADDING IN  LARGE CASES SEVERAL HUNDRED POUNDS OF BAND TENSION AND SO I PROSEN CONS IT SO EAS A GAME IT CHANGES THE CURVE BUT IT'S IT'S 'S A VERY GOOD TECHNIQUE I'M THAT THAT PEOPLE IT'S FERLY EASY IMPLEMENT IT'S FUN AN AFFECT IF YOU TRY THIS ON ON A BENCH OR SQUAT YOU CAN O O THE FIRST TIME YOU GIVE TO GO YOU C ALL MY GOT AS THE BANDS ARE PULLING YOU ALL OVER THE PLACE I'M SEE HAVE TO GET VERY STABLE VERY QUICK I'M BEEN SHOWIN A NUMBER OF TIMES A HAND FUL OF STUDIES AT A MANY LABORATORIES TO BE A VERY EFFECTIVE TRAINING TECHNIQUE A LITTLET MORE ADVANCED BUT I WNT TO THROW THAT IN THERE FUR THE FOLKS TET TER MAYBE JUST TIRED OF SORT OF DOING THE SAME BARBELLS A NUMBLES AND MACHINES AND AND YOU WANTA TRY SOME DIFFERENT A VERY EFFECTIVE TECHNIQUE TELL'S LIKE ONE YESS GREAT WITH YOUR PERMISSION I'M GOING TO READ BACK MY SUMMARY LIST OF TRAINING FOR POWER IN TRAINING FOR STRENGTH ACCORDING TO YOUR DESCRIPTION AND YOU CAN TELL ME WHERE I'M RIGHT IN WHERE I'M WRONG I'M GOING TO PICK THREE TO FIVE EXERCISES AND THESE SHOULD BE COMPOUND EXERCISES TO MULTIJOINT MOVEMENTS I'M GOING TO PERFORM THOSE EXERCISES FOR THREE TO FIVE REPETITIONS EACH I'M GOING TO DO THREE TO FIVE MOVEMENTS TOTAL PERWORK OUT AN'M I'M GOING TO REST THREE TO FIVE MINUTES BETWEEN SETS IIF I'M TRAINING FOR POWER THE WEIGHT LOADS ON THE WORK SETS O NOT THE WORM UP SETS BUT THE WORK SETS E'RE GOING TO FALL SOMEWHERE IN THE RANGE OF THIRTY TO SEVENTY PER CENT OF MY ONE REPETITION MAXIMUM YE AND THE LARGER THE MOVEMENT THE HIGHER THAT NUMBER GOS SO ON A SQUAT YOU'RE O K GETTING FIFTY OR SIXTY PERCENT ON A BENCH YOU WOULD NOT WANT TO GO THAT HIGH I YOU'D WANT O STAKE CLOSE ATHAT THIRTY TO FORTY PER CINTRING SO THE WAY YOU SKELLED ET UP AND DOWN AS DEPENDEDT UPON A THE DIFFICULTY THE MOMENT GREAT IF TRAINING FOR STRAIN I'M GOING TO HAVE MY WRK SETS BE SEVENTY PER CENT OR MORE OF MY ONE REPETITION MAXIMUM YE AND THE ONLY THING TO AB THERE IS IN TH A CASE A VER ACTUALLY ALL THEM A IT'S OCATICAL LESS THAN THREE REPTS PER SET SO A SINGLE OR A DOUBLE ONE OR TWO EENT IS ALSO FANTASTIC SO WE USE THREE TO FIVE AS THE CONCEPT BUT LESS IS OK GOING MORE THAN THAT IS GENERALLY NOT A GOOD IDEA SO LESS IS OC MORSE TELLY NOT AND THEN YOU LISTED OFF A NUMBER OF REALLY VALUABLE I DON'TLY WANT TO CALL THEM FINE POINTS BUT IMPORTANT POINTS TO KEEP IN MIND WITHIN EACH IN BOTH OF THESE PROGRAMMS ONE THAT REALLY STANDS OUT IN MY MIND IS THIS IDEA OF IF I PERFORM THIS THREE BY FIVE PROGRAMME BUT I'M ALSO INCLUDING SOME HYPERTROPHY WORK FOR ARMS OR CALVES OR MUSCLE GROUPS THAT MIGHT NOT BE HIT AS DIRECTLY AS ONE MIGHT LIKE DURING THE THREE BY FIVE COMPONENT THAT'S OK BUT DO THAT AFTER THE THREE BY FIVE TRAINING AND KEEP IN MIND THAT THAT ADDITIONAL WORK CAN POTENTIALLY COMPROMISE RECOVERY FOR THE THREE BY FIVE POWER PROMOTING OR STRENGTH PROMOTING PROGRAMM THE EXAMPLE BEING FOR INSTANCE IF ONE DOES ARM WORK ON THE FIRST WORK OUT OF THE WEEK OR EVEN THE YOU KNOW THE THIRD WORK OUT OF THE WEEK OR THE FIFTH WORK OUTHERWY AND THAT ARM WORK IS HIGHER REPETITION HYPERTROPY DIRECTED WORK IT'S REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT IT MIGHT IMPEDE SOME OF THE THREE BY FIVE POWER PROMOTING OR STRENGTH PROMOTING TRAINING IN THE SUBSEQUENT WORK OUT SUCH AS TO BE MINDFUL OF THAT AND PERHAPS TRARTLE BACK ON THE INTENSITY OR THE VOLUME OR IF MY GOAL IS STRICTLY POWER OR STRICTLYE STRAINTH PROBABLY BEST TO LEAVE OUT OTHER FORMS OF TRAINING YET LOV IT ONE LOST LITTLE THING I HON'T THINK WE DID JUSTICE IS INTENTION AND THE REAS I WON TO GO BACK TO THIS NOW IS BECAUSE WE'VE TALKED LOT ABOUT SPECIFIC LOADS YOU HAVE TO HET AN THAT'S GENERALLY THE CASE BUT IF INTENTION IS THERE YOU CAN FUDGE THOSE NUMBERS AND TERMS OF HOW MUCH LOAD GOES ON THE BARN FACT YOU CAN GET AS LOWAS NO LOAD ON THE BARK A GREAT EXAMPLE HERE IS LIKE A PLANK EXERCISE SO YOU CA DO A PLANK IN WHICH YOU GET IN POSITION AND YOU SIMPLY CONTRACT THE LEAST AMOUNT NECESSARY TO HOLD THE POSITION ALSO YOU CALD CONTRACT AS HARD AS POSSIBLE PULLING YOUR SCAP YOU LET DOWN ON BACK SQUEEZING YOUR CORE SQUEEZING YOUR QUADS SQUEEZING YOUR GLUVES THAT IS ACTUALLY GOING TO STILL HELP STRENGTH PRODUCTION BECAUSE YOURE ATTEMPTING TO CONTRACT VERY VERY HARD EVEN KNO QUOTEL QUOTE THE LOAD IS THE SAME THAT THING EXTENDS TO WEIGHT ON THE BAR SO YOU COULD THEORETICALLY TO LARGE IMPROVEMENTS IN STRANGTH AT FIFTY PER CENT OF YOUR WON AT MAX IF YOUR CONTRACTING AS HARD AS POSSIBLE AND SO THERE'S A LOTS LOS AND LOSTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN TRAIN FOR STRENGTH THAT OUR OUTSIDE OF THIS WEIGHT LIFTING WEIGHT TRAINING SPECTRUM AND IN EVY PEOPLE IF YOU HEAR THINGS LIKE THIS AND YOUR LIKE WELL I KNOW I READ THIS BOOK OR I SAW THIS OTHER COACH WHO YOU KNOW I IE HAD SO MUCH STRONGER THAT WAY WELL IF INTENTION IS THERE THOSE ARE ABSOLUTELY POSSIBLE THIS COULD BE ANYTHING FROM BODY WEIGHT STYLE OF TRAINING IT COULD BE VERY LOW LOWD IMPLEMENTSELF SO A KETTLE WELL A LIKE KETTLE BELL OR A BALL IT COULD BE SINGLE LEG TRAINING IS LIKE ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT METHODS THEY WILL ONLY WORK FOR STRENGTH OUGH WHEN YOU'RE PAST YOUR FIRST IN A HANDFUL OF MONTHS OF TRAINING IF INTENTION IS THERE AND IF IT IS THEN THESE SPECIFIC NUMBERS AND PROTOCALS DON'T MATTERAS MUCH SO DON'T GET TOO CAUGHT UP IN THEM IF YOU'RE NOT WORRYING ABOUT EXERCISE QUALITY AND THIS IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT HOW YOU STOP TAKING YOUR FONE INTO THE GIM WITH YOU ONE OF OUR FORMER STUDENTS A RAMSYN INGIM IS A THE HEADSTRENGTHENGION COACH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CANSAS AND HE MADE IT HE MADE A GREAT POST A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO OR HE YE GAVE SORT OF A TIP OF HOW DO I IMPROVE TRINING QUALITY AND ONE OF HIS TIPS IS SET YOUR PLAYLIST BEFORE YOU GO T THE GEM ANDTHE REASON IS PEOPLE SEND SPEND SO MUCH TIME AND BETWEEN STUTS JUST FINDING THE NEXT SONG IF THEY LIKE IT MAKES THEIRE WORK OUT SO LONG AND SO ON PRODUCTIVE SO THAT IS ONE STRATEGY OR DO ITH YOU DO WHICH IS DITCH THE MUSIC ENTIRELY WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE MUSIC OR A PHONE TO LOOK AT YOU ONLY HAVE ONE JOB YOU'LL HAVE ONE THING TO PAY ATTENTION TO AND WHAT YOU'LL FIND IS THE QUALITY OF THE TRAINING WE'LL GO UP EXPENENTIALLY YOU'LL FEEL KIND OF QONCL BOARD BUT THAT'S JUST MEAN YOU' GO BACK TO TRAINING AND YOU'LL GET A LOT MORE DENTAGE OF ONE THING TO POCUS ON SO YOU CAN GET A LOT MORE DONE WHEN YOU AVOID THOSE DISTRACTIONS AND WHEN YOU'RE DOING STRAINGH AND ESPECIALLY POWER WORK SINCE IT'S NOT FATIGUING A STRENGTH WILL BE A LITTLE BIT BUT POWER WONT BE PEOPLE THEN T GET VERY BORD THERE USED TO EITHER FEELING A A PUMP OR A BURN OR A SWEAT OR AND THAT'S THEIRE LIKE PERCEPTION OF MY QUALITY OF WORK OUT THESE EXERCISES WILL NOT HIT THAT FOR YOU SO THERE HAS TO BE ANOTHER METRIC YOU'RE LOOKING AT WHICH IS I'M GOING TO TRY TO MOVE AS WELL AS I CAN AS HARD AS I CAN THAT'S GOING TO PRODUCE YOUR RESULTS IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT YOU MISOLD IS NOT DTO THESE WORK OUTS GO DO SOMETHING ELSE YOU'RE JUST GOINGTO BE WASTING TIME YOU'RE GONG TO BE BURNING A VERY LOW AMOUNT O CALORIES YOU'LE WASTED AN HOUR AND YOU CAN GO RIGHT BACK TO THAT PLACE YOU ORE SO BE VERY INTENTIONAL THERE ARE ACTUALLY SOME SOME STUDY SHOWING THAT MUSIC CANNON HAN'S PERFORMANCE WE'VE DONE SOME OTHESE ARE LAP SO WHAT'S THAT MEAN ITS NOT ABOUT THE MUSIC PERSEADES ABOUT THE FOCUS AND INTENT AND DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO BE VERY FOCUS AND INTENT AND YOU CAN ACTUAY GET IN IN OUT VERY QUICKLY AND GET A LOT OF WORK DONE AND SAE LOT OF RESULTS LOF IT OH GET LET'S TALK ABOUT HYPERTROPHY ETOPIC THAT OCCUPIES THE MINDS OF SO MANY YOUTH YOUNG MEN BUT ALSO A LOT OF WOMEN ITHINK ONE OF THE REALLY INTERESTING PROGRESSIONS THAT'S TAKEN PLACE IN THE LAST DECATE OR SO IS THAT FAR MORE MEN AND WOMEN ARE USING RESISTANCE TRAINING IN ORDER TO EVOKE HYPERTROPHY GROWTH OF MUSCLES FOR AESTHETIC REASONS AND FOR ALL SORTS OF REASONS WHAT ARE THE WAYS THAT PEOPLE CAN INDUCE HYPERTROPHY SO NOT TO CORRECT YOU OR INSULTS YOU BUT PROBABLY A A BETTER WAY O THINK ABOUT THAT QUESTION IS REALLY WHAT STIMULI DO I NEED TO GIVE THE MUSCLE TO INDUCE HYPRTOPHY NOW THERE ARE A HORMORAL FACTORS ATARE IMPORTANT THERE ANATRITIONAL FACTORS BUT JUST TO STICK WITH THE CONTECTS OF TRAINING THIS IS REALLY G AT A FRAME A LOT OF OUR ANSWERS AND AS YOU'LL SEE IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I CALL HIPERTRE TRAINING KIND OF IDIOT PROOF INTERMS OF PROGRAM NOW THE WORK IS HARD DIFFICULT AND ALL THAT BUT THE PRECISION NEEDED IS A LOT LESS THAN WHAT WE SAW IN POWER AND STRINE AND SO IF YOU KNOW T THERE THAT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THA YOU DO IT IN THIS STYLE WITH THIS INTENT AND WITH WITH THESE WITHIN THESE FRAMETERS AND IF YOU OUTSITY FORAMER IS NOT OF YET I PERTHAFE HAS A VERY BROAD A RANGE A INTERMS OF YOUR ACTUAL APPLICATIONS AND THIS IS WHY YOU HAVE AND WELL CONTINUE TO SEE COUNTLESS STYLES OF TRAINING THAT ALL WORK I MAY I KNOW YOU A WERE MENTOWRD EARLIER IN LIFE BY ONE OF MY FAVOURITE PEOPLE IN THIS ENTIRE FIELD MIKE MENCER LIKE THIS AN ABSOLUTE CHARACTER HIS STYLE WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU OULD SEE IN A A CLASSIC TEXT BOOK A OR OR ANY UNNUMBER OF DIFFERENT INFLUENCERS OR COACHIS OR INDIVIDUALS AND IF YOU'VE EVER SOUGHIT THOUGHT YOURSELF LIKE WHISE I ALL THESE PROGRAMS WORK AND PEOPLE LEVE TO GEMPD TO THINGS LIKE WELL IT'S THE STAIRWOITS L JUST GET THAT OF THE QUATION FOR NOW INDEPENDEN OF THAT AR THAT'S NOT EVEN PART OF THE QUATION YOU'RE STILL GOING TO SEE RESULTS AND THE QUESTION IS LIKE WHY WELL THAT'S BECAUSE WHAT'S DRIVING CHANGES IN STRENGTH AND POWER ARE THE ADAPTATIONS OF SPECIFICY WHAT'S DRIVING CHANGES AN HYPERTOPHY IS MUCH MORE WELL ROUNDED AND SO YOU HAVE OPTIONS TO GET THERE REMEMBER YOUR TRAINING A MOVEMENT AND NOW YOUR TRAINING A RESPONSE AND A MUSCLE THE COSTIC GROWTH THAT'S VERY VERY DIFFERENT SO IF WE LOOK AT LIKE THE CLASSIC DOGMA WE HAVE TO BASICALLY CHALLENGE THE MUSCLE TO NEED TO COME BACK IN THIS CASE SPECIFICALLY BIGGER AND THE NEW TRAINS NEED TO BE THERE TO SUPPORT THAT GROWTH GET THE NEUTRANCS ASIDE PERHAPS WE CAN COME AND A FEW MORE MENACINE AND TALK ABOUT THAT LSO ALL WE REALLY HAVE TO DO IS GOING BACK TO OUR OUR DOGMA OF ACTIVATION OF SOMETHING ON THE CELL WALL WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS EARLIER THAT'S GOT INDUCE THAT SIGNALLING CASCADE THAT'S GOT TO BE STRONG ENOUGH TO CAUSE TA NUCLYIST REACT TO IT TO GO TO THE RIBEZOWNS TO ANY SHAPE THIS ENTIRE CASCADE OF PROACHING SENTESIS GAY SO THAT SIGNAL HAS TO BE ONE OF A COUPLE OF THINGS EITHER HAS TO BE STRONG ENOUGH ONE TIME IT HAS TO BE FREQUENT ENOUGH OR IT HAS TO BE A COMMIDATION OF THESE THINGS ALRIGHT SO I CAN GET THERE WITH A LOT OF FREQUENCY AND A MODERATE SIGNAL I CAN GET THERE WITH VERY LOW FREQUENCY AND A LARGE SIGNAL IMORE CAN TO WHAT YOU DID WITH WITH MIKE BACK IN THE DAY I'M SURE AND STILL TRAIN THAT WAY STILL TRIN EACH YOUR MUSTLEY ROUTE MAINLY ONCE A WEEK DIRECTLY AND ONCE A  WEAK INDIRECTLY SO ALL YOU CAN ALL YOU HAVE TO DO THERE TO NOT FAIL IS TO MAKE SURE THE TRAININGS HARD ENOUGH AND IT'S GOIN TO WORK IF YOU CHOOSE THE FREQUENCY PATH THEN YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT TRAINING TOO HARD FHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY MAINTAIN THE FREQUENCY THE ONLY WRONG COMBINATION HERE IS INFREQUENT AND LOW INTENSITY IN LO VOLUME THAT'S IT IS LONG AS ONE OF THOSE THREE VARIABLES IS HIGH YOU'RE GIT TO GET THERE BECAUSE THE MECHANISMS THAT ARE NEEDED TO ACTIVEATE THAT SIGNALING CASCADE AR WIDE RANGING AND THIS IS WHY WHEN WE EVEN SEE THINGS LIKE BLOOD FLOW RESTRICTION TRAINING RIGHT THIS IS WHEN YOU PUT LIKE A COFF ON YOUR ARM OR YOUR LEG AND YOU BLOCK BLOOD FLOW AND YOU USE NO LOAD OR AS LOW AS SAY THIRTY PER CENT OF YOUR MAXIMUM AND YOU TAKE IT TO FATIGUE FAILURE THAT ACTUALLY IS AN EQUAL THE EFFECTIVE WAY OF INDUCING A PERTRUPY DESPITE THE FACT IN YOU'RE USING THREE FIVE TEN MAY BE MOSTE TWENTY TO THIRTY PER CENT OF YOUR ONE AT MEX WHY BECAUSE YOU WENT THERE THROUGH THE ROUT OF OF METABOLIC DISTURBANCE O OTHER WAYS SAY A HIGHER LOAD MAY BE AS HEAVY AS YOU CAN FOR A SAY EIGHT REPETITIONS IS GON TO GET THERE THOUGH ITS CALLED MECHANICAL TENSION AND SO THERE'S THERE'S THESE DIFFERENT PASS THAT CAN GET THE SAME SPOT NOW EVENTUALLY THESE THINGS HAVE A SATURATION POINT SO YOU DON'T NEED ALL THREE OF THESE MECHANISMS THE THIRD ONE OF COURSE BEING MUSCLE DAMAGE OR BREAK DOWN AND IAND I KNOW I WANT A CHATELE ABOUT THAT BUT NONE OF THESE THREE ARE ABSOLULY REQUIRED YOU CAN HAVE MULTIPLE OF THEM IN A SESSION YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE BREAK DOWN AT ALL THAT IS A COMPLETE REALLY TO FLOHT OUT LIE THAT YOU HAVE TO BREAK A MUSCLE DOWN TO CAUSE IT TO GROW THAT THIS DOS NOT NEEDED AT ALL YOU HAVE TO HAVE ONE OF THESE THREE THINGS THEM AND SO AGAN THIS LLOWS YOU A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY WHICH IS WHY CRAFTING YOUR PROGRAM WHICH IS BEST FOR YOU IS ECTUALLY FAIRLY SIMPLE WHEN IT COMES TO I PERCHABE YOU JUST HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOU DO THE WORK AND YOU ANGHT TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE I FOU STANDARDS IN PLACE WITH THE EXERCISE CHOICE AND SOME OTHER THINGS AT WLE WILL ITNESS A SECOND BUT THAT'S REALLY THE FUNDAMENT AL WAY OF GETTING TO IT MAKING SURE EITHER THAT SIGNAL IS LOUD ENOUGH OR FREQUENT ENOUGH TO GIVE THEN NUTL I A CONVINCING ENOUGH REASON TO SPEND THE RESOURCES COUSD YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER TWO THINGS IN ORDER TO GROW NEW SKELETO MUSCLE YOU NEED A MENOASSES WHICH ARE YOUR A SUPPLY ANDTHEN YOU NEED PRIMARILY CARBA HYDRATES AS THE ENERGY SOURCE TO POWER THAT SENTHESIS PROCESS YOU REMEMBER BASIC CHEMISTRY AND SAYS IF YOU'RE IN TO TAKE TWO ATOMS AND YOU GAN A PULL THEM A PART OR PUT THEM TOGETHER RIGHT THAT'S GOING TO TAKE ENERGY TYPICALLY AND IN MOST OF ACTUALY METABOLISM WHEN YOU SPLIT ABON YOU CAN GET IT'SCALLE EXTRAGONIC YOU'RE GIT TO GET ENERGY FROM THAT WHEN YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER THAT'S GOING TO TAKE ENERGY THIS IS WHY WE CALL THIT PROTINE SYNTHESIS RIGHT SO YOU HAVE TO CONVINCE YOU'RE NUCLEOUS THAT ONE INVEST THOSE RESOURCES IN ENERGY PRIMERELY CAR BAHYDRATE BUT NUMBER TO AND MORE IMPORTANTLY INVEST THAT'S SUPPLY THERE IS THE PON APOSSIBLE WAYSTIC AN ENERGY BUT THERE'S A VERY LOW AMOUNT OF EMENOMASSIS AVAILABLE AND YOU NEED THEM FOR MANY MORE THINGS S THEN JUST TAKING YOUR BYSEPS FROM SAVING HINTEN INCHES TO EIGHTEEN INCHES RIGHT IT'S NOT GOING TO DO THAT IF YOU'RE IN A POSITION WHERE AGAIN YOU CAN'T SUSTAIN A MUNE FUNCTION IF IF RED BLOODS SELL TURN OVER NEEDS TO BE HIGHER ARE INY THE OTHER MAIN LIKE TONS OF THINGS THAT YOU NEED PROTNS FOR SO YOU HALF TO BIL A SAY LIKE ARE YOU SURE YOU REALLY WANT O SPEND THESE RESOURCES AND BUILD IT IN A MUSCLE BECAUSE ONCE WE DO THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GO BACKWARDS BREAK THEM BACK OUT BRINGIN ME LASSES BACK INTO THE TO THAT AVAILABILITY POOL SO WE CAN USE THEM FOR EITHER ANOTHER FUNCTION ENTIRELY OR EVEN A NOTHER MUSCLE GROUP THAT'S CALLED PROTINE REDISTRIBUTION BY THE WAY WHEN YOU SAY A MAYBE YOU DON'T DO IM A LOT AFBUPER BODY WORK AND YOUR TRAINING AND YOU'RE NOT EETING ENOUGH PROTING OR AMINABLE AMOUNT AND YOU'RE DOING A LOT OF LIFTING YOUR LEGS YOU'LL YOU'RE NOTICE YOUR LEGS WILL GET LARGER BUT THAT'S ACTUALLYABOUT O TIMES YOU'RE PULLING THE PROACHING FROM SO YOURE UPPROBODING THIS CASE AND REDISTRIBUTING IT BACK DOWN TO THE QUOD SO THAT'S THE WAY YOU HAVE THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO GET TO AND IN TERMS OF APPLICATION WHAT NUMBERS TO HIT WE CAN GO THROUGH EACH ONE OF OUR MODIFIABLE VARIABLES I'M DUSTLIKE WE DID WITH SPEED N STRENGTH AND POWER AND WALK THROUGH SOME OF OUR BEST PRACTICES IN EACH CATEGORY YES SO I'D LOVE TO TALK ABOUT THOSE MODIFIABLE VARIABLES AS THEY RELATE TO CHOICE OF MOVEMENTS ORDER OF MOVEMENTS VOLUME SO SET IN REPETITIONS AND FREQUENCY OF TRAINING AND TA PARTICULARLY INTERESTEN FREQUENCY OF TRAINING BECAUSE THAT RELATES TO THE SO CALLED SPLIT WHERE TYPICALLY ONE IS NOT TRAINING THEIR WHOLE BODY EVERY WORK OUT ALTHOUGH THERE ARE I'M SURE HYPERTRIFY WORK OUTS TAT ON OUR WHOLE BODY WORK OUTS BUT WHERE PEOPLE ARE DIVIDING YON THEIR BODYPARTS AND ON TO DIFFERENT DAYS WELD LOVE TO GO THROUGH THIS LISTS ONE BY ONE STARTING WITH EXERCISE CHOICE GO GREAT SO IN THE PREVIOUS SECTION WE PRETTY MUCH SET EXCLUSIVELY CHOOSE YOUR EXERCISES BY THE MOVEMENT PATTERNS AND YOU WANT A BALANCE BETWEEN PUSHING AND PULLING AND ROTATION OF THINGS LIKE THAT IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE YOU HAVE THE OPTION TO DO EITHER HERE'S MY RECOMMEDATION MOST PEOPLE DEFAULT ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY TO CHOOSING BY BODY PARTS HERE RIGHT I'M GOING TO DO CASTS AND SHOULDERS TO DAY AND CHEST AND BACK WHATEVER COMBIDATIONS TOF THINGS THEY WANT THAT IS CLEARLY EFFECTIVE STRAGEGY HOWEVER A MANY STUDYES ACT  HAVE ACTION BEEN DONE WHER YOU CHOOSE BY MOVEMENT PATTERNS AND THAT IS ACTUALLY EQUALLY EFFECTIVE NOT ONE LITTLE CAVIOT ACTI IY SHOULD HAVE SED A FEW MINUTES AGO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE RESEARCH ON MUSSLIPERTROPY IT IS IMPORTANT TO DISTINGUISH THE FACT THAT THE VAST MAJORITY THIS RESEARCH IS COMING FROM A NOVICE TO MODRATELY TRAIN INDIVIDUALS THERE'S ACTUALY MORE AND MORE RESEARCH COMING OUT ON TRAIN INDIVIDUALS BUT THAT'S STILL MODERATELY TRAINE RIGHT EVEN THOSES WHEN SO WHAT HAPPENS IN THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE ACTUALLY WAY PASS THAT POINT WE DO WE DON'T KNOW SCIENTIFIF IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO RESEARCH THERE SO IT'S IMPORTANT CAVIOT I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE WHEN I SAY HAY YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THIS SIR YOU HAVE TO D TIS YOU WERE ASSUMING IT A A TRAIN ING STATUS OF MODERATE TTO LOW MAY IR MAY NOT BE TRUE PASS THAT WE DON'T KNOW SCIENTIFICALLY I HAVE CERTAIN THOUGHTS PERSONALLY BUT THE SCIENCE WLL ONLY TAKE US THAT FAR SO THAT BEING SAID YOU CAN ACTUALLY CHOOSE BY MUSCLE A OR BY MOVEMENT PATTEN HERE WHICHEVER IS IS YOUR PERSONAL PREFERENCE AND THIS IS ACTUALLY WHERE YOU CAN ACT JUST BECOME A GOOD COACH WHETHER YOU'R COACHING SOMEBODY ELSE THROUGH THIS FITNESS JOURNEY OR TO YOURSELF AND GIVE THEM A LITTLE BIT OF A TONOMY SO MAY BE UE SELECT THE FIRST THREE EXERCISES AND THEN LET THEM SELECT ONE EVERY DAY AND SO IF THEY ESPECIALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ONE MULSO GROUP GROWS LET THEM TARGET THAT MUSCLE AND MAY BE THE REST THE DAY YOU'VE ACTUALLY SPLITED UP AS PUSH PULL OR SOMETHING ELSE LIKE THAT ALL THOSE STRATEGYES ARE EFFECTIV PERSONAL PREFERENCE AS LONG AS THE TOTAL MOUNT OF VOLUME ON THE WORKING MUSCLE IS AT QUATED THROUGHOUT THE WEEK WHICH WILL GET TO THOSE NUMBERS IN A SECOND THAN YOU'RE GET TO BE THE EXACT SAME SPOT NO PROBLEM I WOULD ACTUALLY GENERALLY EN COURAGE PEOPLE TO CHOOSE EXERCISES I'M IN A VARIETY OF FASHIONS I ACTUALLY THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU DO SOME A NUMBER OF COMBINATION OF WHAT WE CALL BY LATERAL AND UNI LATERAL EXERCISES SO BY LATERAL BEING THINK ABOUT IT LIKE A SQUAT WHERE BY MEANING TOO LATTERAL YEF TWO FEET ON THE GROUND MOVING INSEQUENCERE UNALATERAL IS ONE SO THIS COULD BE SOMETHING IS SIMPLE AS A A REAR FIDIL OF IT IS BUT SQUAT IT COULD BE A SINGLE LEG LIKE PRESS OR SINGLE EG CURL COULD BE A PISTOL SQUAT SOMETHING WERE THE THE INDIVIDUAL LIMB IS MOVING ONE THAT TIME YOU NEED TO HAVE A COMBINATION OF BY LATERAL AND OU LATERAL I'M TRAINED THAT'S GOOD TO DO FOR STRENGTH AS WELL PROBABLY NOT SUPERIMPORTANT FOR POWER BUT I'M ALSO VERY IMPORTANT FOR MAKING SURE FOR I PERTRAY'S SAKE YOU'RE NOT GETTING ANY IN BALANCES A AS YOU PROGRESS ESPECIALLY THROUGH MONTHS AND YEARS OF TRAINING SO MAKE SURE YOU'RE DOING A LITTLE BIT OF ACCOMBINATION WHETHER YOU WANT A PICK SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTS THAT'S REALLY A METHODS QUESTION AND A PREFERENCE QUESTION THEN IT IS CONCEPTS SO DUNBELL GREAT CATERBELL FINE BARBELL OSSUM BAND DOESN'T MATTER BODYWAIHT THAT NONE OF THESE THINGS ARE AS IMPORTANT I'M BECAUSE ALL YOU'RE TRYING TO DO S CRATE A CERTAIN INSULT IN THE TISSUE AND THE IMPLEMENT IS JUST WHICH EVERY ONE YOU FEEL BEST DOING IT AND THIS IS WHERE ACTUALLY MACHINES COME INTO PLAY A LOT MACHINES ARE GREATLY UNDER APPRECIATED THERE ARE A PHANTASTIC RESOURCE ESPECIALLY SOMEBODY WHOSE EITHER EARLY IN THEIR FITNESS JOURNEY OR SOMEBODY WHO REALLY IS HAVING A HARD TIME TARGETTING MUSCLE GROUP WITH A BIGGER COMPOUND MOVEMENTSO WHEN YOUR CHOOSING EXERCISES FOR APERTUPHY YOUR GON TO WANT START WITH THOSE BIGGER COMPOUND MOVEMENTS THAT'S GOING TO BE A DRIVE A LOT OFTHE ADAPTATION YOU CAN GET TO THESE SINGLE JOINT MOVEMENTS LIKE A LITTLE BIT LATER BUT HAVING SAID THAT BECAUSE OF OF THE WAY THAT PEOPLE MOVE DIFFERENTLY THEIR BOMB AR THEIR ANTHROPROMETRICS AND AN THEIR BO MECHANICS AND EVEN THEIR TECHNIQUE THE SAME EXACT EXERCISE WELL NOT NECESSARILY WORK THE SAME EXACT MUSCLE GROUPS FOR MOST WH PEOPLE SO IF YOU AND I BOTH WENT  DID A BACK SQUAT I'M IF YOU DID IT LITTLE BUT MORE OF WHAT WE CALL A HIGH BAR SQUATS TO THIS IS THE BAR IS LITTLLY SITTING UP HIGHER UP ON YOUR NECK YOU'RE KEEPING YOUR BACK MORE VERTICAL AND BECAUSE IN ORDER TO DO THAT YOU SHIFT YOUR KNEES MUCH FURTHER PAST YOUR TOES KEEPING OF COURSE YOUR WHOLE FOOT ON THE GROUND IN GOOD POSITION  THAT'S GOING TOO GENERALLY PUT MORE OF AN EMPHASIS ON THE KNEE JOINT RIGHTON SO THOAT'S NOT A BAD THING I YOU TEND TO SEE A LITLE BIT MORE WORK IN THE QUADS THERE I LITTLE BIT LESS WORK IN THE SPILE O RECTORS AND BACK BECAUSE YOU'RE ACTUALLY NOT SUPPORTING 'M THE WEIGHT HORIZONTALLY WHICH IS A DIFF IT'S IN MUCH MORE DIFFICULT POSITION IT'S IT'S VERTICALLY STACKED  IF I WERE DO IN THE CLASSIC LULBAR SQUAT WHICH IS AGAIN LOWERING THE BAR DOWN MY FURTHER DOWN MY BACK TOWARDS A MUMMER LIKE MY SHOULDER BLAZES I PROBABLY TAKE A LITLE BIT OF A LIHTER STANDS AND WHEN I SQUAT I DRIVE MY GLUTES BACK FURTHER AWAY FROM MIDLINE IN AS EFFACT AS A GENERAL RULE IF YOU TAKE THE MIDLINE OF YOUR BODY THE THING THAT MOVE IS THE FARTHEST AWAY FROM THAT MIDLINE IS LIKELY TO BE THE THING THAS ACTIV ATTING THE MOST SO IN THE CASE OF THE OF THE FRONT SQUAT I'M YOU'RE NOT GENERALLY GOING TO BE USING YOUR GLUTES AS MUCH IF YOU'RE IN THAT ARE NOT IN FRENSCOT JUST THAT HIGH BAR SQUAT WHERE YO'R VERY VERY VERTICAL YOUR KNEES AN T BE MOVING VERY FAR OVER YOUR TOES HICH IS FANTASTIC THEREFORE ITS LITLE BLE MORE KNEED DOMINANTS CAN WE SAY IT THE OTHER VERSION HERE YOU KEENT KEEP YOUR SHINS REALLY CLOSE TO VERTICAL YOU MOVE YOUR BUT BACKWARDS YOUE CAN A HAVE TO THEN LEAN FORWARD WITH YOUR TORSL WHICH MEANS THAT TO BE MORE LOW BACK MORE GLUTES AND A LITTLE BLAST NA NOW THAT'S A GENERAL STATEMENT IS NOT NECESSARILY ALWAYS TRUE BUT AS A GUYD LING THERE THAT IS ONE EXACT EXERCISE OR WEU MAY BE GOING MAN I'M TRYING TO IMPROVE THIS CLEAR WEAKNESS I HAVE IN MY QUADS I CAN'T EVEN LEGUSTENCH AN MY BODYWEIGHT I HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM THERE SO MAYBE IN YOUR PARTICULAR CASE IF I'M HAMMERING YOU ORE YOUR HAMMERING YOURSELF IN A SQUAD EXERCISE AND YOU'R WONDERING WHY YOUR QUADS AREN'T GETTING ANY STRONGER OR ARE GROWING IN ANY SIZE IT MAY BE BECAUSE OF THE STYLE OF THE MOVEMENT SO I MAY NEED TO GO ANDREW ARE RIGHT LOOK SQUATS IN GENERAL F YOU LOK AT THE RESEARCH ARE AN EXCELLENT EXERCISE FOR QUAD DEVELOPMENT BUT FOR YOU THE'RE NOT BECAUSE OF THE WAY YOU STAND OR JUST BECAUSE OF INNORAL ACTIVATION IT DOESN'T MATTER SO I NEED TO TAKE YOU TO MACHINE AND ISOLATE THAT MUSCLE GROUP SO WE CAN MAKE SURE WE SEE DEVELOPMENT IN THAT SO IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GROW A SPECIFIC BODY PART AREA INDIVIDUAL MUSCLE IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT TAT YOUR ACTORSEEING PROGRESS THERE AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT WELL IN THE TEXT BOOK THE BENCH PRESS IS SUPPOSED TO BE GOOD FOR YOUR PACK CAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY MOVING THE RIGHT POSITION OR DEPENDS ON THE ANGLE IN WHICH YOUR STERNUM ACTUALLY SITS IN YOUR BODY T A BENCH PRESS MAY ACT TOU E DOING VERY LITTLE FOR YOUR PECK AND YOU MAY NEED T A JUST TO SAY AN INCLINE BENCH OR DECLINE BENCH OR A PECK FLA SO MACHINES CAN BE FANTASTIC AT LETTING YOU ISOLAT WITHOUT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT THINGS LIKE STABILITY I YOURE LOW BACK POSITION N GETTING HER WHERE YOUR NECK AT YOU CAN REALLY CONCETRATE ON JUST THE MOVEMENT CONCENTRATE ON THE MUSCLE AND LET EVERYTHING ELSE KIN OF GO AWAY AND INSURE YOU'RE GETTING TRAINING IN THAT SPECI FIC AREA THOSE ARE EXCELLENT RECOMMENDATIONS ONE THING I WANT TO ASK ABOUT IS PRIORATIZING SPECIFIC BODY PARTS AND THEREFORE SPECIFIC EXERCISES AND HERE I'M NOT NECESSARILY REFERRING TO TRING TO BRING UP BY SO CALLED WEAK BODY PART NO AT AREA THAT TENDS TO BE AITHER GENTICALLY DEFICIENT CAUSE IN SOME CASES I LEARND FOR INSTANCE HAVING SEENG A LOT OF A COMPETIVE TRACKANFIELD CHAMPIONSHIPS A LOVE WASHING TRACKAFIELD IS A SPECTATOR OF THE HEYWARD FIELD AN ORGAN WHENEVER THERE'S A MEAT OHERA REALLY LOVE THAT THE SPRINTERS ARE AMAZING A THEY HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST CALVES IN THE WORLD THAT I'VE EVER SEEN IM AN I G LIKE MITLO MICRO CALVES BUT THEIR FAST TO SELL THYES AND IT 'R RIGHT BEHIND THE KNEE AND I HAVE A VERY LONG DISTANCE BETWEEN THAT CALF AND THEIR FOOT WUSTI MAKES A PREPULSION EXCELLENT THEY WOULDN'T STAND A CHANCE AS A COMPETIDE BODY BUILDER BUT BECAUSE SOMETHING DIFFERENT IS BEING SELECTED FOR IN BODY BUILDING BUT OBVIOUSY THEIR THEIR A MAGNIFICENT PRINTING MOST PEOPLE OF COURSE RESIDE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE EXTREME OF YOU KNOW VERY LONG MUSCLE BELLIES FROM OUN ORIGIN TO INSERTION A OR VERY VERY SHORT MUSCLES USUALLY PEOPLE HAVE ONE OR TO BODY PARTS THAT THEY WANT TO EMPHASIZE FOR WHATEVER REASON YOU KNOW THESE DAYS IT SEEMS TO BE A PEOPLE REALLY WHETHER THEY SANG NOW LIKE GLOOTS OF THE NEW BICEPS OR BICEPS OF THE NEW GLR I DON'T KNOW ANYWAY YOU SEE THE TEL I LOVE BEM BY THE WAY I AM SO PRO CURLS IN THE SQUATRAC THEYRE  A LOVE THERE YOU SO ON'T NOBODY KILL ME SO EVERYONE HAS THEIR THING BUT THE THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE BUT I HAVE A QUESTION BECAUSE WE'RE SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT HYPERTROPHY WHICH IS SHOULD PEOPLE GIVE THEMSELVES PERMISSION TO NOT TRAIN A BODY PART IF THEIR GOAL IS BALANCED HYPERTROHY I'LL GIVE A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I FOR INSTIS NOT DONE A LOT OF FREEWAIT SQUADING IS BECAUSE I DESPITE MY QUATERSEPS BEING RATHER WEAK ACCORDING TO YOU A THEY TEND TO GROW RATHER EASILY RELATIVE TO OTHER MUSCLE GROUPS AND THE GOAL FOR ME HAS ALWAYS BEEN BALANCED DEVELOPMENT AND SO I EMPHASIZI HAMSTRING WORK AND I EMPHASIZE A YOU KNOW A CALF WORK IN HEMPSTERN WORK AM IS NOME THAT DON'T TRAIN MY QUADS AT ALL BUT I DO FAR LESS FOR THEM AND I AVOID THE BIG COMPOUND MOVEMENTS FOR THEM I OCCASIONALLY DO THEM AND WHAT AGAIN THIS IS NOT ABOUT WHAT I DO OR DON'T DO YBUT I THINK THAT IN THE CONTECTS OF A CONVERSATION ABOUT HYPERTROPHY IS IT APPROPRIATE TO GIVE PEOPLE PERMISSION TO SAY LISTEN IF YOU'RE JUST GENETICALLY A IUN A STRONG LARGE LATS DOING A LOT OF CHINUPS IN ROWS MIGHT ACTUALLY BE THE WORST THING FOR YOU IF YOUR GOAL IS BALANCED DEVELOPMENT AND I A I ASK BECAUSE I DON'T OFTEN HERE A ANY ONE ANY YOU KNOW A CREDENTIAL PEOPLE GIVE PEOPLE PERMISSION TO COMPLETELY AVOID TRAINING A GIVEN BODY PART IF THEIR GOAL IS BALANCED DEVELOPMENT AND YET I THINK MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE RESISTANCE TRAINING OUR SEEKING BALANCE DEVELOPMENT I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY THAT ACTIVELY WANTS TO HAVE BIG UPPER BODY SMALL LEGS I THING THAT COMES FROM NEGLECT AND LAZINESS INMOST INN SOMETIMES INJURY RELATED OR OTHER THINGS BUT I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT TO RAISE THAT ANY GOOD PROGRAM FOR HYPORTROPHY I WOULD THINK WOULD HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT PEOPLE'S GENETIC AND NATURAL VARIATION AM SPORT BASED VARIATION IN WHICH MUSCLE GROUPS JUST TEND TO GROW EASILY FOR THEM IN WHICH ONES I REQUIRE A LOT MORE FOCUS AND WORK YET ABSOLUTELY YOU FIRST WAY YOUF PERMISSION TO DO OR NOT DO ANYTHING YOU LIKE TO TERMS OF O I BRIDCH REE TRAINING I GENERALY WOULD NOT RECOMMEND DISREGARDING IN MUSCLE GROUP ENTIRELY I KNOW THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU ACTUALLY SUGGESTED BUT JUST TO MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE DIDN'T HER IT THAT WAY WHAT I WOULD DO IS IN THIS EXAMPLE IS I WOULD CONTINUE ODO THOSE BIG MOVEMENTS I WOULD JUST KEEP THE VOLUME UP SO I MIGHT DO TWO SETS OR SOMETHING A TWICE WEEK THERE'S A WHOLE WONCH O REASONSE YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE MOTOR PATTERNS ARE THERE YOU OGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE THE WUESPECIALLY THE BENEFIT OF THESE COMPOUND MOVEMENTS IS YOU GET TO WORK SO MANY COMPLIMENTARY MUSCLE MOVEMENTS AT THE SAME TIME SO IN THE CASE OF LIKE LOADED SQUAT YOU'RE NONLY WORKING STABILITY IN THE HIP AS WELL AS THE NEED BUTYOU'RE ALSO WORKING UPPER BODY YOU'RE YOUR WRONG BOYS ARE KEEPING IN POSITION YOUR NECK HAS THE SAME POSITION YOUR TOES EVERYTHING IS WORKING AND SO IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO GET THOSE THINGS WHEN YOU TAKE THAT MOVEMENT OUT IND YOUR PLACE IT WOULD SAY A A MACHINE HANDSTRING GIRL THAT WHOLE ELEMENT OF BALANCE IN YOUR LOGICAL CONTROL IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN OVER TIME AND AT JUST GETS REMOVED WITH IF YOU GO TO MACHINES ONLY SO I WOULD KEEP SOME WIT THOSE THINGS AND MAYBE NOT ALL YOUR ROUND MAY BE ONE QUARTER OF THE YEAR OR TWO QUARTERS EVERY OTHER ROATATE AT SOMETHING LIKE THAT AS LONG AS ITIS EN YOU'RE NOT IF THE REASON YOU WEREN'T DOING TO SAY THOSE SQUATS WAS BECAUS YOURE LIKE AT HURS MY BACKERS O CAKE GRATE THEN LEAE IT OUT BUT IF IS IST SIMPLY YOU DON'T WYN YOUR QUADS GRUP YOU MUCH I WOULD JUST KEEP THAT VOLUME LOOK AND DO SOMETHING JUST TA COUNT OF TOUCH IT KEEP IT ACTIVATED AND TO MAINTAIN ALL THOSE OTHER THINGS LIKE FLEXIBILITY ARRANGE A MOTION I WOULD BET ANYTHING YOUR ADDUCTORS ARE PROBABLY UNERDEVELOPED NOW YOU CAN GET THOSE BY DOING YOUR SQUATS CAT YOU'RE NOT REALLY DOING I'M SURE MUCH ADUCTION TRAINING AND SO THIS THINGS LIKE THAT THAT JUST GET LOST WHEN YOURE ONLY THINKING ALL BIG MUSCLE GROUPS THAT THAT CALM INHERENT IN DOING THE LARGER MOVEMENTS AND SE DON'L HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THEM ARE TRAIN THEM SEPARABLY I APPRECIATE THAT AND IN REALITY I DO TO TO THREE REALLY HARD WORKS THAT'S O HAK HACK MACHINE SQUATS PER WEEK YE WHICH IS PLENTY FOR ME TO MAINTAIN AND EVEN GET A L BIT STRONGER YE BUT PER OR EARLIER DISCUSSION ABOUT A YEAR AGO I SHIFTED TO DOING VERY LOW REPETITION RANGES TO MAIN STRENGTH IN THAT MOVE THEGO BUT I AM ACTIVELY AVOIDING HYPERTROPHY IN THAT MUSCLE GROUP YET OR ANOTHER ESOLUTION WOULD ACTUALLY BE DO SOMETHING LIKE ONE SET TO FAILYURE A WEEK NOT EVEN EXTREMELY LONG JUST YOU KNOW DO SOMETHING IN THE AID TO FIFTEEN REPETITION RANGE AT THE END OF ALL THAT STRANG THAT IN JUST GI LIT LA BIT OF PUMP THERE AND AND IT JUS JUST SUGJUST SO THAT THOSE MUSCLES CAN TOUCH THAT LEVEL OF FATIGUE TOUCH A LEVEL OF STRAIN AND MA CAN NICAL TENSION WOCK AWAY GREAT THANK YOU FOR THAT WHAT ABOUT EXERCISE ORDER AMAZING SO IN IMPLICIT IN THIS EXERCISE CHOICE THING IT IS WHAT YOU CANNOSIS THESE MODIFIABLE VARIABLES INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER RIGHT AND YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE HOW WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT VOLUME AND DECLARIFI VOLUME IS THE REPETITIONS MULTIPLIED BY THE SETS THAT'S TYPICALLY HOW WE EXPRESS VOY WELL THAT'S CAN BE DIRECTLY INFLUENCE BY INTENSITY THE HEAVIER LOAD YOU PUT ON THE BAR BELL THE LESS REPETITIONS YOU CAN DO AND THE INVERS RAY A REST INTIVALS THE SHORTER YOU KEEP YOUR RESTINABLES THAN EITHER THE LOWER THE WEIGHT HAS TO GO THE INTENSITY OR THE LOWER THE REP RANGH ASSAGO ORDER IS THE SAME THING CHOICE IS THE SAME THING SO ALL THESE THINGS MODIFYING EACH OTHER THEY PLAY A LITTLE BIT OF A HAND AND AN WHATEVERYTHING ELSE DOES SO WITH THE EXERCISE CHOICE THING ROLLING IN T EXERCISE ORDER YOU GET TO PLAY A COUPLE OF GAMES HERE WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT STRENGTH AND POWER I BASELY SAID STICK TO THE BIG MOVEMENTS MOST COMPLICATED COMPOUND MOVEMENTS FIRST YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT WITH HIPERTROPHY YOU CAN DO THE TIN A COUPLE OF WAYS YOU CAN DO THE THING YOU'RE TIS SIMPLY MOST INTERESTED IN FIRST YOU CAN DO THE THINE CALLED PR FATIGUE SO SAY YOU'RE YOU'RE  GOING TO DO A BACK DAY YOU CAN GO IN AND DO NOTHING BUT ISOLATED BISEPS AS YOUR VERY FIRST EXERCISE AND THEN ROLL INTO YOUR YOUR PULLING MOVEMENTS BECAUSE WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS DURING MOST PULLING ACTIVITIES THE BYSEPS ARRY SECONDARY ORE TERTIARY MUSCEL GROUP BUT YOU'VE PREFATIGUE THEM YOU'VE GUARANTEED THAT MUSCLE OF MOST INTEREST GOT ITS IT'S MOST TRAINING IN AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS SECONDARY SO YOU CAN STARD IF YOU WANT WITH SINGLE JOING MOVEMENTS YOU CANSTART WITH ISOLATIONS OF OR YOU CAN START WITH COMPOUNDS UP YOU THE WAY IT JUST REALLY COMES DOWN TO PREFERENCE AND WHAT YOU'R SPECIFICALLY TRYING TO DEVELOP NOW THIS ALSO GOES BACK TO THE EXERCISE CHOICE QUESTION RIGHT CAUSE IT'S UD SORTOR THE SAME THING RIGHT LIKE WHICH ONE OF MI CHOOSING AND WHERE I WANTED IT THE CAPTIVES WAS THE EXERCISE SPLITS AND SO YOU SORT OF TALKED ABOUT IT MY DOING BY PART SPLITS AND I KNOW A QUESTION I GET A LOT HERES WHICH ONES SHOULD I PACKAGE TOGETHER I'M NOT REALLY CONCERNED WITH IT WHAT YOU ALL YOU SHOULD WORRY ABOUT IS HOW MANY TIMES PER WEEK AND EFACT TOTAL VOLUME YOU ACHIEVE ON A MUSCEL GROUP PER WEEK AND I DON'T DOESN'T REALLY MATTER HOW ERE THOSE THINGS ARE FOLDED IN IT IT'S REALLY A PERSONAL PREFERENCE ISSUE I ONE MISTAKE THAT WE SEE HERE COMMONLY IS GROSSLY UNDER APPRECIATING THAT THE LEGS ARE NOT A MUSCEL GROUP I SO THE LEGS HAVE A WHOLE BONCH OF MUSCLE GROUPS IN THEM SO WE SEE A CLASSIC SPLIT LIKE I'LL DO SHOULDERS AND CHEST MONDAY AND THAN I'LL DO YOU KNOW BISEPS AND FOUR ARMS TUESDAY AND THEN LEGS WEDNESDAY WHATEVER AND THEN BACK TO UPPER BODY AND AELS LIKE YOUE LIKE WITOMEN YOU HAVE FOUR DAYS DEDICATE T THE UPPER BODY AND ONE FOR QUOTEN QUOT LEGS WELL YOU  HOPE YOU U CAN SEE THE ABALANCE WHAT' THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THO VER TIME IS YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT DO FAR MORE APPER BODY THAN YOU ARE LARD BODY AND THAT'S NOT APPROPRIATE SO YOU JUST WANT A THING ABOUT YOUR LOWER BODY LIKE YOU OUD DO IF YOURE GING TO DO BODY PAR SPLITS THAN INCLUDE THOSE THINGS AS WELL I KNOW JUST CHUNK EVERYTHING IN HIS LEGS ONCE A WEEKIF YOU WANT TO DO THAT THAT ACTORY O K BUT THAT DAY HAS TO BE VERY VERY CHALLENGING AND YOU PROBABLY SOULD DO A QUITE ABIT OF VOLUME A THER CAUS YOU YOU'RE ALMOST SURELY NOT GOING TO HET THE TOTAL WEEKLY VOLUME NEEDED TOPTOMISE MUSCLE GROWTH IF YOU'RE LITERLLY ONLY DOING ONCE A WEEK OF YOUR COTON QUOTE LEGS SO ALONG THOSE LINES LET'S TALK VOLUME YET HOW MUCH VOLUME DOES EACH MUSCLE GRUP NEED PER WEEK IN ORDER TO GENERATE AND FOR THAT MATTER MAINTAIN HYPERTROPHE RIGHT SO THE THE KIND OF MINIMUM NUMBER WERE LOOK FOR HEREIS TEN WORKING SEPTS PER WEEK CORRECT PER MUSCLE GREW CORRECT AND A JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONES ON THE SAME PAGE IF I DO A CHIN UP OR PULL UP I'M GOING TO MAINLY BE TRAINING MY BACK MUSCLES MY LATS IF I'M DONG IT CORRECTLY LAPS AND RONBOIDS A BYE THE RI AND IF YOT 'RE SO BUT THEY'LL BE INDIRECT TARGETING OF THE BYSEPS SO WOULD YOU INCLUDE INDIRECT TARGETING SO FOR INSTANCE IF I YOU SAID TEN SETS PER WEEK LEST U SEUSE BYSEPS AUSIT SEEMS T THAT'S THEY GO TO A GENERIC MUSCLE FOR WHAT WY IS THAT BY THE WAY THAT WHEN PEOPLE ASK SOMEBODY YOU KNOW O FLECTS THEIR MUSCLE THEY LWAYS FLEX THEIR BY SET THEY DON'T FLEX THEIR CALF UAD OR THEIR GLUTE CERTAINLY I GUESS THERE SOME  YOU KNOW PUBLIC DECENCY ISSUES I CAN TELL YOU A WITH MY CHILDREN THAT'S THE VERY FIRST MUSCLE I THOUGHT THEM TOFLECTS THEIR GLUTS NO THE'RE THEY'RE BA TA YALWAYS AS THEY ARE AND IN GOOD A GOOD A HEALTHY PARENTSING ADVICE FROM DOCTOR IN TO YELVAN SO IF IT'S TEN STS PER WEEK FOR BISEPS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OR FURTHER GROW THE BYSEPS BUT DOES THAT MEAN IF SOMEBODY DOES TEN SETS OF CHINNUPS OR TEN SETS OF CHIN UPS AND ROWS THAT THEY ARE CHECKING OFF ANY OF THE BOXES FOR BYSEPS ASSUMING THAT THEY'RE DOING THE MOVEMENT PROPERLY AND TARGETING THE MAJOR MUSCLE GRUP THAT A GIVEN MOVEMENT ISPOSE TO TARGET  IN MY MIND WHEN YOU'RE DOING A CHIN UP YOUR SPAS TO MAINLY BE USING YOUR BACK MUSCLES AND THEN THERE ARE SECONDARY MUSCLES OR SECONDARY ACCUBATION OF OTHER MUSCLES BUT OF COURSE SOME PEOPLE THEIR ARMS GROW LIKE CRAZY WHEN THEY DO GIN UPS AND THEIR BACK DOESN'T GROW AT ALL SIT IS WHERE WE'RE BACK TO THE KIND OF AM CINETIC PRELOADING OF THE SYSTEM YEAM IF YOU WILL SO HOW IT HAS ONE MEET THIS TEN SETS PER WEEK MINIMUM WHEN DIVIDING DIFFERENT BODY PARTS AND THINKING ABOUT THIS DIRECT AND INDIRECT AGGRAHATION SO TO THINK THERE'S NO SPECIFIC EXACT RULE HERE AND THIS IS WHY THESE SET RANGES ARE RANGES AR IN THISCISNT WY WAY WE DON'T STAY LIKE TENAS SO TEN WOULD BE SORT OF THE MEN AMUM NUMBER YOU WANT TO GET TO THE MORE REALISTIC NUMBER THAT MOST PEOPLE ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE ADVANCE OR EVEN INTERMEDIATE I'S MORE LIKE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY WORKING SETS PER WEEK  NOW IF YOU'RE VERY WELL TRAINED YOU PROBABLY WANT EVEN PUSHED MORE TOWARDS LIKE TWENTY FIVE AND IN FACT A PASS THAT THERE'S NESS NOT ON A RECERTH SO THE OPTOMON NUMBER MAY BE THIRTY WE DON'T WE DON'T REALLY KNOW IT JUST HARD TO GET THAT MUCH WORK AN EY MAY ACTUALLY BE DETRIMENTAL AND HERE WERE REFERRING TO NATURAL ATHLETES THAT IS PEOPLE WHO FOR WHATEVER REASON EITHER BECAUS THEY'RE NOT TAKING ANY PRESCRIPTION DRUGS OR MAYBE IF THEY ARE WHOSE LEVELS OF STIRRIHT HORMONES MAINLY THE ANDREGENS LIKE TESTOATRAM ET CETERA DO NOT EXCEED THE NORMAL REFERENCE RANGE VALLES EITHER BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE NATURALLY OR THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE REPLACING THROUGH FARMER COLOGY YET WHEREAS IT WHEN WE THINK OF TECHNICALLY SOME ONE COULD BE TAKING XOGUNISTS HORMONTS TO REPLACE BA DEFICIENCY AND THE OTHER STILL IN NORMAL RANGE QET BUT I JUST WANTED A CLARIFIED BECAUSE YOU WORK WITH ATHLETES IN NUMBER DIFFERENT SPORTS WEARE DRUGS ARE IN ARE NOT TOLERATED ET CETERA AND THE GENERAL POPULATION THAT WHAT WERE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS FOR THE GENERAL POPULATION YOU NOT FOR STARROGHT USING ATHLETES CORRECT NOYET CRIT SO IM SO TEN WAS DISORT ER THAT LIKE ABSOLUTE MINIMUM NUMBER TO MAINTAIN WHICH IS ECTUALLY PRETTY COOL IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY I IF YOU WENT IN AND YOU DID THREE SETS OF TEN THE VERY STRES TATS OF TEN REPETITIONS CORRECT YOU YOU'READY AT THREE YOU DID THAT THREE DAYS A WEEK YOU'RE AT YOUR NINE THAT'S OMISTON IF YOU ALSO DUST WONT TO GIM ONE DAY A WEEK YOU DID THREE SETS OF TEN AND YOU DID THREE EXERCISES YOU'E AT NINE S AT WORKING SETS YOU'RE PASELY DON SO ACHIEVING TEN SETS PER WEEK PERMUSCLE ROUP AND NOW WA'RE NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT INDIRECT ACTIVATION OF A SECONDARY SO YO'RE YOU'RE GOING TO HIT TEN FAIRLY EASY IM EXTENSION O THAT HITTING TWENTY IS ACTUALLY STILL NOT THAT HORRD BECAUSE OF WHAT'S ACTUALY CON A HAPEN THERE SO IN YOURE EXAMPLE IF YOURE DOING YOUR CHIN UPS WELL WOULD THE BISEPS COWN THI THERE'S NO EXACT RULE THERE BECAUSE THERE COULD BE TECHNIQUE ISSUES COULD BE HAND POSITION SO YOU MENTION CHIN UP VERY SPECIFICALLY A CHIN UP IS ACTUALLY GON TO PUT YOUR HANDS AND IN THIS POSITION WHERE YOUR PALMS ARE FACING UPRIGHT THIS IS SUPINATION OF PRONATIONS SO YOU TO BE THERE WELL THAT'S ACTALLY QUITE DIFFERENT THAN A PULL UP WERE YOUR HANDS ARE EARN THE OPSIDIRECTION SO M BE CHIN UP ACTUALY IS GONGTO BE PRETTYGOOD ACTIVATOR ER BISEPS FOR MOST PEOPLE  SO YOU WOULD EXPECT ACTUALLY PROBABLY COUNT THAT CAUSE IT'S GOIN BE VERY DIFFICULT TO NOT SEE SOME FATIGUE IN YOUR BICEPS DEPENDING ON YOU ARE MECHANICS DEPENDING ON AND BY THAT I MEAN JUST THE THE SEGMENT LENGTHS OF YOUR BOMES THAT'S WEROUR MUSCLES OR ORIGINATIN SIR THERE'STHERE'S NOTHINGYOU COUL DO BOUT NOT EVEN A TECHNIQUE ORE A FOCUSSAS YOU ASSIST SIMPLE FACT THE MATTER THAT'S HOW YOU PULL BEST IN EREA M THE POSITION OF WHICH YOUR HANDS ARE M ON THE BARBRA WIDER GRIP OR NARROW GRIP IT'S GOING TO CHANGE MUSCLE USE SO WE TALKED ABOUT IM EARLIER I THINK IN THE PREVIOUS EPISODE THAT EXERCISES DO NOT DETERM ADAPTATIONS APPLICATIONS SO BUT EXERCISES DO DETERMINE THINGS LIKE THE MOVEMENT PLAN THE JOINT YOU USE AND TYPICALLY THE E CENTRIC CONCENTRIC SORTERATIO AS WELL AS OFTEN TIMES THE MUSCLE GROUPS INVOLVED SO THERE'S JUST NOT A LOT OF THINGS YOU CAN DO DEPENDING ON HOW YOU ARE BUILT OF  SOME EXERCISEES ACTIVATING A SECOND YEAR GROUP WOU DON'T WANT US O NOT ALWAYS TA TECHNIQUISOUR MAY JUST BE THAT'S HOW YOUR BELT RIGHT THE SAME COULD BE TRUE FOR A SQUAT THE HI BARBAROUS'S LOWBARIC SORT OF EXAMPLE WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER ITS OU KNOW YOU YOU COULD SEE PLENTY OF OF EVIDENCE ON A MUSLE ACTIVATION STUDIES WHERE PEOPLE EVEN DOING THE VERTICAL BACK SQUAT STYLL HAVE TREMENDOUS GLUTE ACTIVATION AND FOLKS DOIN THE  THE LOWBAR I HAVE TREMENDOUS QUAT ACTIVATION SO A LOT OF IT DEPENDS ON PERSONAL MECHANIC SO WHAT I COUNTIT IS THE QUESTION REALLY YOU JUST HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF NUMBER ONE DO YOU REALLY CARE THAT MUCH YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A RANGE TO GET TO IF YOU ERE ANYWHERE BETWEEN TEN TO TWENTY FIVE WORKING SETS YOU KNOW YOURE FINE SO IF YOU COUNTETOR DON'T COUNT IT IT'S JUST ONNOT CHANGE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHETHER YU' DID SEVENTEEN WORKING SETS OR TWENTY THREE AN EITHER WAY YOU'RE FINE SO I DON'T RELEAK HERE NUMBER TWO ARE YOU ACTUALLY FEELING ANYTHING THERE SO IF YOU'RE DOING YOUR CHIN UPS AND YOU'RE BISEPS ARE BLOWING UP I'M COUNTING THAT RIGHT IF YOU'RE DOING IT YOURE LIKE NONOT FEEL ANY FATIGUE THERE US ALL MY THEN I PRIVIUS I CAN RUNING AN A COUNT THAT IS MISS TOWARDS THEM SO IYOUFCAN JUST LET THAT GUIDE YOUR LITTLE BIT TORRENTS YOUR ACCOUNT YE I'VE ALWAYS NOTICE THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN MUSCLE GROUPS THAT ARE VERY EASY TO ISOLATE YET WHEN UNDER LOAD AND THOSE ARE ALMOST ALWAYS THE SAME MUSCL GROUPS THAT ARE EASY TO CONTRACT VERY HARD WITHOUT ANY LOAD WHATSOEVER BENGO YOU KNOW THT'S ACTUALLY REALLY IN SIGHTFULE SO YOU CAN CONT Y USE THE URISTIC OF OF LIKE IF YOU CAN CONTRACT YOUR LATS JUST STANDING HERE YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO CONTRACT THEM VERY WELL WHEN YOU LEFT IF YOU CAN'T YOU CAN PROBABLY BOUT THE SAME THINGS CAN I HAPPEN SO I YET YOU'LL KNOW THIS ECTECT THE LASTS ARE ACTULY REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE THEY TEND TO BE ONE OFTHE MORE DIFFICULT MUSCLE GROUPS TO LEARN HOW TO ACTIVEIT SO IF YOU'RE IN YOUR JOURNEYG YOU DUST LIKE I HAVE NO IDEA AND A YOU CAN LOOK UP LIKE A LAT POSE SO HOW DO YOU LIKE HOWDYPOFF YOUR LAST IHOW YOU SHOW IT AND IF YOU DO THAT YOU'RE LIKE WHILE THERE'S NO MOVEMENT HERE JUST RECOGNIZE THAT'S EXTREMELY COMMON AND THAT IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO TAKE YOU MANY MANY MANY MONTHS OF TRYING BEFORE YOU START TOU SEE SO MOVEMENTS AND PROBABLY EVEN A FEW YEARS BEFORE YOU REALLY START TO SHE ACTIVATION SO YOU YOUR NOT SOME SORT OF LIKE SPECIFIC LIKE SPECIAL GENANEC ANOMALY IT'S VERY VERY COMMON IT'S UNCOMMON TO NOT BE ABLE TO ACTIVE AT YOUR BISEPS RIGHT THAT EVERYONE CAN DO THAT BUT IF YOU JUST LIKE MAN I CAN'T GET THIS HERE I'M DISCAN A STOP DOING IT DO NOT DO THAT JUST KEEP AT AND JUST KEEP CONCENTRATING AND THINKING ABOUT THE MUSSL GROUP IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME IT'S VERY COMMON TO TO HAVE CHALLENGES ACTIVATING LATS YI'VE NOTICED THAT MANY OF THE MUSCLE GROUPS THAT WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR A LARGE FRACTION OF THE WORK IN THE VERY SPORTS THAT I PLAYED AS A YOUNG CHILD AR MUSCLES THAT ARE VERY EASY FOR ME TO SELECTIVELY ISOLATE AND INDUCE HYPERTROFEAN ISPPOSE I'M ONE OF THOSE MUTENTS WHERE MY LATS HAPPEN BE ONE SUCH OF THOSE MUSCLE GROUPS I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE I SWAM ALOT WHEN I WAS I YED DOLIT GOIN ASK REASERN YES I DON'T TELL TELLSIA EVERY ONE EVERY KIT IN MY TOWN SWAM AND PLAYE SOCKER AND THEN LATER I I ESCAPE WORN IDSOME YOU GENERALLY HEAR OT ANSWER IS THAT SO YOU EITHER WERE A SWIMMER OR YOUR WRESTLER SOS LIKE THAT PULLING AND PULTORTUS IS THOUSANDS OF REPETITIONS ALLOWED YOU TO GET VERY GOD O CONTRACTING BUT BECAUSE AM I ALSO PLAYED SOCKER AND ESCAPE WORDING BUT I DIDN'T DO ANY BASEBALL BASPLAR FOOTBALL MUSCLE GROUPS LIKE DELTOIDS AVERY CHALLENGING TO ACTIVATE NIYALIA SO I DO THINK THAT EARLY DEVELOPMENT IS SUPERIMPOSED ON A GENETIC TEMPLET THET SO PREDICTS WHICH MUSCELE GROUPS ARE GOING TO BE EASIER HARDER TO ISOLATE AND AND TRAINS ALSO A VERY GOOD CASE FOR WHYIT'S IMPORTING TO DO AS MANY DIFFERENT ATHLETIC ACTIVITIES AS YOU CAN IN YOUR YOUTH YE AND IF YOU DO SCAPE WORD DEFLING LEARNED TO RIDE SWITCH CAUSE EVERY EVERY SCAPE WORDER I KNOW HAS ONE LEGE THAT'S LARGER AN NOW THA WA HAL THAT'S LARGER THAN THE OTHER AND THE ASTAY FOR THAT MATTER AM PEOPLE DO MARSHAL ARTS THAT DON'T LEARN TO A IF YHE'RE NOT SOUTH PO IF THAT DON'T LEARN TO SWITCH OUP AND O THEIR A THERE WORK SOUTHPOD YOU SEE THE SAME THING IMN YOURE BUILDING IN A SYMMETRY INTO THE SYSTEM AND IT'S NOCIOUS MUSCULAR IT'S NURL O ESTRODINARY NURL YET AM SO YE KIDS AM PARENTS GET YOUR KIDS DOING A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT THINGS I SUPPOSE YOUR MNASTICS WOULD PROBABLY BE THE BEST SPORT ALL ROUND IN TERMS OF AM MOVEMENT IN MULTIPLE PLANES AND ACTIVATING ALL THE DIFFERENT MUSCLE GROUPS A YES AN NOW A THERE'S A LOT OF BENEFIT NO QUESTION ABOUT IT THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER THING SO THAT IT THAT HAS LIMITED ABILITY SO I'M ALMOST EVERYTHING IN  NOT TO LENT GYM MASUS RAY BUT ALMOST EVERYTING THAT IS PREPLANNED WHICH IS A MAJOR DOWNFALL RIGHT SO THE JOY OF SCATING IS THERE SO MUCH PROPERCEPTIVE IMPOT THAT YOU HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS VERY QUICKLY I'M IN IN  SMALL WINOWS NOW YOU HAVE A LITTLE WITHOUT IN YOUR FLIPPING IN THE AIR AND HAVE THE LAND BUT YOU GYMNASSICS GIMNESS TEND TO HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC ROUTINE AT THEIR WORKING ON THEY WORK ON THAT RETINE FOR YEARS AN AT IT SO IM GALLERING FOR ME WAS TRANSPORTATION IT WAS FREEDOM AND IT DIDN'T REQUIRE ANY COACHES OR PARENTAL OVERSIDE HET YET BALS HORTS HAVE THE BEAUTY OF EVEREACTION AND THINGS I CMEANT SO ALL OF THEM ARE WONDERFUL A YET A GOOD TO DO A LOT OF THEM YOU'VE ESTABLISHE THAT TEN REALLY TO TWENTY SETS PER WEEK YET IS THE AN ABOUNDS FOR AM MAINTAINING IN AND INITIATING HYPERTRATRY YET IF I WERE TO LIKE FLAG ONE OF TEM I WOUT SAY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY IS THIS AT THAT YOU WANT TO GET I'M WORKING NOW IT GETS COMPLICATED WHEN YOU ASK HOW MANY WREPS PER SET DO I HAVE TO GET TO O  WELL WE ALSO CAN COMPLICATE THAT BY REPETITION TYPE AND TEMPLE JUST SORT OF LET L THAT GO FOR NOW AND JUST THINK IF YOU'RE GETTING CLOSE TO THAT RANGE YOU'RE IN THE SPOT AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO NOW AS BALANCE TO THINGS RECOVERYING CONTINUED TRAINING GAVE SO IF YOU'RE SOMEWHERE IN THIS TEN TO TWENTY WORKING SETS RANGE AND YOU'RE IN A POSITION WHERE YOU CAN CONTINUE TO DO THAT YOU'RE NOT SO SORE AND SO DAMAGE AND BEAT UP THAT YOU CAN'T MAINTAIN THAT VOLUME FOR N EIGHT WEEKS AT A TIME OR A LEAST SIX WEEKS AT A TIME THET ION PROBABLY SAY EITHER THE STYLE OF REPETITIONS THE MOUT EF RE PTITIONS PERSET YOU'REDOING ARE TOO MUCH THE VOLUME IS GETTING TO YOU HOWEVER IF YOU NOT SEEING ADAPTATIONS THEN IT'S THEY MAY BE THE REPETITIONS AREN'T ENOUGH AND THAT'S LIKE THAT'S THE COTI GAME YOU'RE RUNNING NOW THERE COULD BE PLENTY OF OTHER FACTORS INTENSITY OF COURSE YET TENSITY IM INTENT ANDTEN OF COURSE THE OTHER THINGS SLEEP ATRICIAN ET CETERA ALL THESE OTHER THINGS THAT THAT GOIN TO OUR VISIBLE STRESSER CATEGORY THAT WE ALWAYS ANALYZE THIS THIS SORT ER BRINGS UP THIS IDEA OF RESPONDERS AND NON RESPONDERS SO WE GET THIS ONE A TIME SO WYSE IT SOME PEOPLE I MIGT MY JIM BUDY MY ROOM MATE WE GO TO SLEEP THE SAME TIME ROUN THE SAME NATRITION PLAN WE WORK OUT TOGETHER A SHEE TRIPLES AN MUSCLE SIZE AND I DON'T HAVE LIKE NOGAND WHATSOEVER WELL THERE'S A LOT OF A WORK THAT WERE TRYING TO DO TO IDENTIFY THE MOLECULAR MECHANISNS BEHIND RESPONDERS AND NON RESPON RS CAUSE THEY CLEARLY EXIST IN FACT THIS IS ON O THE REASONS WHY I EVERY PAPER IBASIY WILL EVER PUBLISH AGAIN IF I YOU NOW IF I DO ALWAYS REPORTS INDIVIDUAL PERSON DATA SO RATHER THAN GROUP AVERAGES YOU GET TO SEE YOU KNOW IF THERE'SE TEN SUBJECTS AND IT YOU GET TO SEE HOW EACH OTHER TEN RESPONDED BECAUSE THE GROUP AVERAGE CAN GET CONFUSING WUT YOU REALLY WANT O SEE IS HOW MANY ACTUALLY PEOPLE GOT BETTER HOW MANY GOT WORSE IHOW MANY MAY BE CHANGE IF SO I'M SO WE'ALWAYS REPORT THOSE INDIVIDUAL DATICAUS WHEN YOU GO TO TRAIN YOUR YOU'RE YOU YOU'RE NOT THE GRUP AVERAGE THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO KNOW SO IF YOU DO THAT YOU CAN SEE A BEAUTIFUL LINE OF THESE HYPER RESPONDERS THE BELL CURVE THE MIDDLE OF THE NORMAL SPONDERS IN THOSE FOLKS WHO MIKE THROUGH ANY TRAINING STUDY JUST WON'T GET ANY BETTER I IF YOU CAN TEASE OUT WHICH YOU CAN'T BUT LET'S SAY IN SCIENCE YOU COULD TEASE OUT ALL THE ACTRA FACTORS TOTALSTRESSSLOW HIDRACION SLEEP ET CETERA WHAT YOU OFTEN SEE IS NON RESPONDERS A LOT OF A TIME AR IT'S NOT THAT THEY HAVE A PHYSIOLOGICAL INABILITY IT'S THIS THAT THEYS DIT THEY NEED A DIFFERENT PROTICOL AND LOT OF TIMES IT'S THEY JUST NEED MORE VOLUME SO IF THEY CAN HANDLE THAT AND A NOT ACCESSILY BEAT UP JUST GIVE THEN MORE VOLUME IN THEY TEN TO SEE A LOT OF BREAK THERS I YOU SEE THE SAME THING WITH PLATEAUS I'M SO TYPICALLY SORT OF TO SYCOCAY THE ROUTINE YOU'RE ON YOU BEN ON IT FOR TOO LONG WE NEED EITHER GO TO THE OTHER END TOF THE HYPERTROPHY SPECTRUM FOR INTENSITY WHICH MEANS LIKE IF YOU'VE BEEN IN THE LIKE SIXTE TO SEVENTY PER CENT EVERY ONE OUR PETITION MACX RANGE MAYBE WE ACTUAL NEED TO GO HEAVIER A TAKE AR RE PETITIONS DOWN MAYBE VEN OUR TOTAL VOLUME DOWN A GO HAVYER TRY THAT A GREAT WAY TO BREAK THOUGH PLATEAUS OF GRAN IF ALL THE OTHER BOXES ARE CHECKED I THE OTHER ONE IS IS DO THE OPSIT WHICH IS LIKE OKA WE'REN'TO GO HIGHER WENNIGO SETS O TWENTY SUCH A TWENTY FIVE HIG VERY HIGH REPETITION RANGE AND REALLY GET AFTER IT 'M NOT A DO AS MUCH DAMAGE CAUSE YOU DON'T TEN TO GET AT SORE FROM THOSE REALLY HIGH REPETITION RANGES YOU'LL GET MORE SORE FROM TH E LOWER REPETITION HIGHER INTENSITY RANGE THANYOU WILL TYPICALLY THE OTHER ONES AND AND SEE IF WE CAN BLESS BUSS THROUGH AND PLATEAUS THERE SO IT JUST GENERALLY MEANS YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING LITTLE BUT DIFFERENT THAN YOU'R YOURE TRAINING PARTNER SO WE'VE TALKED ABOUT EXERCISE T OICE AND WEVE TALKED ABOUT THE NUMBER OF SETS THAT ONE NEEDS IN ORDER TO INDUCE HYPERTROPHY PER WEEK WHAT ABOUT RE PETITION RANGES YOU'VE MENTIONS A PRETTY BROAD REPETITION RANGES HOW MANY RE PETITIONS PURSE AT 'S REQUIRED IN ORDER TO INDUCE HYPERTRO YET SO THEY'RE TWO CAVIOTS HERE BEFORE YOUE WHAT THE NUMBER IS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN LIKE FOUR TO THIRTY RAPS THIRTY RE PETITIONS ABSOLUTELY IN FACT I THINK YONG GO MUCH HIGHR THE FIRST TWENTY HAVE TO BE FEEL EXCEEDINGLY LIGHT CORRECT AND DURING THOSE FIRST TWENTY OR SO REPETITIONS IS THE GOAL STILL TO CONTRACT THE MUSCLE AS HARDEST POSSIBLE ON EACH REPETITION SO THIS IS THE CAVIOTS HERE SO CAVIOT NUMBER ONE IS THERE IS AN ASSUMPTION THAT BY THE END OF THE SET YOU'RE GETTING SOMEWHAT CLOSE TO FAILURE AND SO YOU'RE DON'T HAVE TO GO TO ABSOLUTE FAILURE TO TO INDUCE MOST LIKE PRTRE BUT YOU YOU ALSO HAVE TO GET KIND OF CLOTHES SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO A SET OF TWENTY FIVE AND YOU FINISH IT IN YOUR LIKE WHO YES I THAT WAS KINDSTARTING AT HART THEN THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH IF YOU'RE GIN TO DO A SET OF FIVE OR SIX AND THE SAME SORT OF EXPRESSION COMES AUT YU MOUT THAT'S NOT CAN ET SO IN THAT CASE IT DOESN'T MATTER WERE UPT RANGE IF YOU'RE NOT GETTING SOMEWHAT CLOSE TO FAILURE AGAIN IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE COMPLETE FAILURE A GOOD NUMBER TO THINK ABOUT IS LIKE MINUS TO WHICH IS WLLY CALL REPTS AND RESERVE WHICH THE SORT OF LIKE I GOT WITHIN TWO OR SO REPS OF FAILURE THAN I STOP AND CAN WE DEFINE FAILURE AT LEAST FOR SAKE OF THIS PORTION OF THE CONVERSATION AS THE POINT IN WHICH YOU CAN NO LONGER MOVE THE RESISTANCE COULD YOUR BODY COUL BE YE A WAIT MACHINE ET CETERA THAT YOU CAN NO LONGER MOVE THE RESISTANCE ANY MORE IN THE CONCENTRIC PHASE OF THE EXERCISE MOVEMENT IN GOOD FORM CORRECT UT THAT'S A REALLY NIGHT MOMENTARY MUSCULAR FAILUREIS AS HIWE TYPICALLY DEFINE IT THERE'S A WONDERFUL REVIEW I THINK IT'S OPEN ACCESS THAT JUST CAME OUT THE LAST HANDFUL OF MONTHS MERIC CALMS'S TEAM OUT OF NEW ZEALAND THE ERIC IS IS A GREAT SCIENCES AND A VERY EXPERIENCED PHYSIQCOACHAND COPETETOR HIMSELF SO HE KNOWS A LOT ABOUT THE SERIA AND THAT PAPER RINT THROUGH ALL THE EXACT DEFINITIONS IN DETAIL ALL THE CAVIOTS TAT WHEN I CAN HAVE TIME TO GET INTO DODAY SO I WOULD RECOMMEND FOLKS LIKE CHECK THAT O THEY WAN MOR INFORMATION BUT IL I'LL TRY TO GET THE HIGH LIGHTS OF AT RIGHT HERE SO WHAT THE BASECAS SHOWED IS GOING ALL THE WAY TO FAILURE IN THE DEFINING FAILURE LIKE YOU JUST DID RIGHT SO MOMENTARY MUSCULAR FAILURE YOU CAN'T COMPLETE ANOTHER REPETITION THROUGH COMPLETE RANGE OF MOTION THROUGH WHATEVER RANGE OF MOTION YOU DETERMINE PRIOR TO TAS WELL AS WITH GOOD TECHNIQUE SO OTHER BODY PARTS AREN'T BEING COMPROMISE SERVE ET CETERA AND DOESN'T NEED TO BE TOTAL FAILURE THAT MINE US TO FAILURE IS STILL NEEDED IN CAVIOT TO WHICH IS AGAIN VERY VERY HIGHLY TRAINED INDIVIDUALS YOU WON'T SEE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKE ERIC OR A VOKES WHO ARE SIX TO EIGHT TO TEN YEARS INTO VERY SERIOUS RAINING IM WHO DON'T HAVE TO GO O FILL YOUR PROBABLY LITTLE BUT MORE THAN WHAT I JUST SAID SO THE THE THE LAY OUT THAT THEY BROUGHT IN THEIR PAPER WAS VERY NICE AND THE BISCIS SAIDLOK CA HERE IS A COUPLE OF CENAREOS IN WHICH  GOING TO FAIL YURE IS MAYBE THE BEST WAY TO DO IT I'M NUMBER ONE YOU PROBABLY SHOULD DO IT ON A LITTLE BIT OF THE SAFE FOR EXERCISES SO MAYBE TAKING YOUR BACK SQUAT ON A BARBELT TO COMPLETE FAILURE IN DOING THAT IS LIKE A STANDARD PROTOCAL MULTIPLE TIMES WEEK IT'S MAYBE NOT THE BEST CHOICE SO MAYBE IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO BORROW EL BACK SQUATS YOU TAKE THAT TO YOURE YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE ONE OR TWO WREPS AND RESERVE STOP THERE IT'S A LOT OF WORK AT ACTUALLY GOING BACK TO OUR DISCUSSION OF THE PROLIPAN TURN IT'S A SIMILAR IDEA RIGHT WREGNS SPEND MOST OF YOUR TIME IN THESE WORKING SETS SEVENTY TO NINTY SORT OF PERSET AND THEN YOU CAN TAKE THAT FAILURE TO MAYBE THE HACK SQUAT MACHINE ORE MAYBE VEN TE LIKESTENSION MACHINE SO A LITTLE BIT OF A SAFE FOR EXERCISE THEY ALSO CAN TEND TO BE SINGLE JOING EXERCISES DON'T HAVE TO BE BUT THEY'RE JUST ONES THAT ARE NOT AS COMPLICATED AND YOU'RE NOT LIKELY TO INJURE OTHER BODY PARTS WHEN YOU'RE DOING IT I I'M SO THAT'S ONE WHAT ONE WAY TO GO ABOUT IT ANOTHER WAY TO GO ABOUT IT IS SIMPLY DOING IT ON LIKE THE LAST MOVEMENT OF THE DAY RIGHT AND SO AGAIN YOU'RE NOCKING TO DO IT ON YOUR FIRST THREE OR FOUR EXERCISES BUT WHATEVER YOUR LAST FINISHER IS YOU'LL IT TOTAL FAILURE ON THAT ONE AND THAT KIND OF KEEP TO IN A RANGE OF YET HIT SOME FAILURE YOU GOT A LOT OF OVER ALL WORKED ON SAT'S A LOT OF STIMULUS THAT'S A LOT OF NOISE GOING TO THAT NEW CLACEAS AS GROLL GROLL GROLL GOL GROW BUT YOU DIDN'T TOTALLY OBLITERATE YOURSELF I ESPECIALLY IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE ASSISTANCE OF ANABALOXERIS RIGHT THAT'S VERY YRIMPORT IF YOU HAVE THOSE YOU CAN PUSH THIS LOT HARDER AUSE YOUR RECOVERY WOULD BE SIGNIFICAANT HANDS IF NOT I YOU CANT WON A WALK AWAY FROM THATI HAVE TOO SOON THAT YOUR NINETY NINE PERCENT OF PEOPLE TO SAYING THIS DO NOT AN AM AN AND YET AMONG THOSE WHO ARE NOT TAKING ANYTHING IM IN TERMS O VANABALICS THERE I THINK IS A LARGE RANGE OF RECOVERY CUOTIONS OUT THERE SOME PEOPLE JUST TEND TO RECOVER BETTER SOME PEOPLE I THINK ALSO ARE FAR MORE DILIGENT ABOUT WHAT I WOULD CALL THE UM NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT VARYABLES OF YO ADEQUATE SLEEP YA PROPER NEUTRURCHIN AM LIMITING STRESS AND AND SO ON YET I CAN'T WAIT TO BREAK ON THISEF DOWN I GOT A WHOLE IN A VERY LONG DISCUSSION FOR ALL THOSE THINGS AT WE WILL GET INTO IT IN ALL ITS PRACTICAL REALITIES AND ACTIONABLES OM BEFORE LONG WHAT ABOUT REST BETWEEN SETS GRAT THIS IS THE INNERPLAY NOW SO ONE ACTUALLY THING WE SAID FOR LONG TIME IS YOU WANT A STICK BETWEEN THIRTY TO NINETY SECONCE OF REST BETWEEN SET FRIOPORTROPHY AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO  I ACTIBATE THIS METABALL LIKE DISTURBANCE OR ISRAPTION 'M YOU NEEDO LITTLE BIT OF TO BURN A LITTL BIT OF A POMP TO GO THERE MORE RECENT RESEARCH A LOT IS OUT OF BRAD SHOINFELLS LAB AND OTHERS HAVE SHOWN THAT THT'S JUST DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE CASE AGAIN FOR MODERATE I TO TO NEWLY TRAINED INDIVIDUALS WHETHER THAT'S THE CASE FOR THE HIGHLY TRAINFOLKS I DON'T NECESSARILY NO I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY DIFFERENCE HERE SO YOU CAN TAKE UP TO THREE TO FIVE MINUTES E RESTING BETWEEN SUS AND BE FINE THE CAVY OT HEAR THOSS THIS IF YOU'RE GOING TO REST LONGER THAT MEANS THE METABALLIT CHALLENGE IS LOWER SO YOU NEED TO THEN INCREASE THE CHALLENGE IN EITHER MECHANICAL TENSION WHICH THINK ABAT IS WAIT LOAD OR MUSCLE BREAK DOWN SO YOU CAN'T LOWER ONE OF THE VARIABLES KEEP YOUVERTHING ELSE THE SAME AND EXPECT THE SAME RESULT SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE REST THAN YOU NEED TO EITHER PRESERVE  THE LOAD ON YOUR BAR OR THE VOLUME ONE OF THE TWO HAST TO HAPPEN SO THIS GIVES PEOPLE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY I GENERALLY TELL PEOPLE IF YOU'RE GOING TO TRAIN FRIPERTROPHY IT'S PROBABLY BEST TO STAY IN THA TWO MINUTE RANGE ATMOST YOU CAN GO LONGER BUT LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE A HARD TIME ACTUALLY COMING BACK AND THEN EXECUTING THAT NEXT SET WITH ENOUGH INTENT TO GET THERE AND OR IT'S GOING TO MAKE YOUR WORK OUT TREMENDOUSLY LONG SO YOU CAN STICK TO THE SHORT OR ONE YOU DON'T HAVE AS MUCH MECHANICAL TENSION BUT THAT'S  KAY I YOU CUST TI IT THERE BUT REALITY OF T IS OU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WOULD LIKE TELL ME IF THIS IS A REASONABLE STRUCTURE GIVEN WHAT YOU'VE TOLD US THREE EXERCISES PERMUSCLE GROUP FIRST EXERCISE SLIGHTLY HEAVIER LOADS SO REPETITION RANGES SOMEWHERE BETWEEN U SAY FIVE AND EIGHT WITH PERHAPS GETTING FAILURE CLOSE TO IT ON THE LAST SET REST PERIODS OF SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TO OR LET'S LET'S GET WILD AND SAY FIVE MINUTES SIR O CASE WHAT'S I BIT MORE OF US STRENGTH TYPE WORK OUT AT THAT POINT BUT THEN MOVING TO A SECOND EXERCISE OF THREE OR FOUR SETS WHERE THE REPETITION RANGES NOW EIGHT TO FIFTEEN SHORTENING THE RST PERIODS TO NINETY SECONDS OR SO AND THEN ON THE THIRD EXERCISE RE PETITION RANGES OF TWELVE TO THIRTY THE SNUMBER THIRTY KIND OF IT MAKES ME WIDE I DON'T YE THAT CIMERAL AST SOME I I A SET OF OF THIRTY THINKING IT WAS FOR HYPERTROPHY BUT WHAT YOUR SAN MAKES AVERYSANSENTERY IS RESEARCH BACK O VERY SHORT REST INTERVALS MAYBE THIRTY SECONDS BETWEEN ABETWEEN SETS WOULD THAT ALLOW SOMEBODY TO TARGET ALL THREE FORMS OF MAJOR ADAPTATION AM MIGT IN MY MIND IT WORKS YOU KNOW YOU'RE TULLING ABOUT MECHANICAL LOADS IF I MU STRESS AND DAMAGE AND YOU'RE TALKING OUT METABALL EXTRESS IS THAT BETTER THEN TO FOR INSTANCE TO ALL THE HIGH REPETITION WORK IN ONE WORK OUT PER WEEK  AND THEN HIGHER LOADS IN THE OTHER WORK OUT IT DOES IT MATTER IF YOU DIVIDE THEM UP OR COMBINE THEM IT WILT WOULD NOT MATTER I WOULD SAY IT MATTERS IN THE SENSE OF YOUR PERSONAL PRACTICAL SITUATION WHILE LONG REST FOR ME I LOVE TRAINING HEAVIER WITH LONGER RASTRAT BUT I'M HEARING THAT THERE'S REAL VALUE TO DOING THESE HIGHER REPETITION RANGE AND YET SO THE FORMULA YOU SET UP THEREIN A SECOND IS RIGHT IF YOU WANT TO DO T THE OTHER WAY THAT'S FINE YOU REALLY IT'S KIND OF IDIOT PROOF YOU CAN THAT THIS SUP HOWERIF YOU' LIKE YOU COULD ACTULLY DO THE INVERS THEORETICALLY YOU COULD DO THE THETS OF THIRTY FIRST AND THEN MOVE TO YOUR SETS OF IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER I'M BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO JUST GET TO A CERTAIN TOTAL STIMULI AND YOU'REGOINGTO HIT IT EVENTUALLY SO YOU HAVE A LOT OF ROOM TO PLAY HERE YOU ALSO HAVE A LOT OF ROOM TO ADAPT BASED ON YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES GOT OF SHORT ON TIME TO DAY TYPICALLY MY WORK OUT TAKES ME SIXTY MINUTES FOR THIS PLAN I HAVE I'VE ONLY GOT THIRTY FIVE TO DAY WHAT DO I DO WELL IF YOU'RE TRAINING FOR STRENGTH THAT'S A DIFFERENT ANSWER THAN IF YOU'RE STRAINING FOR I PERCIPY IF YOU'RE TRAINING FOR I PERSH FE YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE YOU HIT THAT TOTAL VOLUME SO THIS PARTRICULAL CASE LOWER THE LOAD LOWER THE REST INTERVALS AND JUST GET TO THE BURN AND GET GOING AS MUCH AS YOU CAN IF YOU'RE TRAINING FOR STRENGTH I WOULD RATHER YOU CUT YOUR VOLUME AN HALF GET THOSE FEW REPETITIONIS DONE AT THAT HIGH LOAD AND JIS DON'T DO VERY MANY SHATS SODAY THAT'S A BETTER RESULT SO THE GOAL THAT YOU'RE GOING AFTER IS GOING TO DETERMINE WHAT WE CALL CHOS MANAGEMENT WHICH IS THAT THING LIKE THAT I'M RUNNING OUT OF TIME TODAY MY TIME IS SHORT OR YETTINVEN THINK MY TIME AS SHORT SOMETHING I CUT OFF I'M NOT FEELING IT TO DAY I'M IN A HOTEL ET CETERA AT CETERA AT CETERA WHICH IS LIFE RIGHT THAT'S GOING TO BE TEN TO FIFTY PER CENT OF YOUR WORK OUTS IS GIN TO BE CHAOS MANAGEMENT WELL HOW YOU MAKE THOSE DECISIONS IT'S GOING TO GO BACK TO UNDERSTANDING NUBER ONE WHANT GO YOU'RE GOING AFTER THE NUMBER TWO WHAT OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCE WOULD CALL THESE PHYSIOLOGICAL LIMITERS FOR EACH ONE AND THAT'S GING TO TELL YOU WHAT TO SELECT AND PRIORATIZE THE VOLUME THE INTENSITY OR WHATEVER ELSE I'D LIKE TO ASK ABOUT FREQUENCY BUT I'D LIKE TO FRAME INT A LITT BIT DIFFERENTLY IM THEN THAT I'D LIKE TO ASK ABOUT TOTAL WORK OUT DURATION WHICH NOVE TAILS WITH FREQUENCY BECAUSE IF ONE IS HITTING THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF SETS PER WEEK AND ONE IS COMBINING DIFFERENT MUSCLE GROUPS ON THE SAME DAYS WELL THEN WORK OUTS ARE GOING TO BE A VERY DIFFERENT DIRECTION THEN IF ONE IS DOING A DIFFERENT BODY PART EACH DAY FOR INSTANCE AND SO FO LIKE ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT FREQUENCY HAS TO BE WITHIN THE CONTECT TO WORK OUT DURATION AND VICE VERSA YET IF YOU ARE A A LIFTING JUNKEY AND YOU'RE VERY CONSISTENT YOUR SCADURAL I'M ACTUALY OCAY WITH BODY PARTSBUTS MOST PEOPLE HAT ARE NOT THAT AND SO THE CONCERN THERE IS IF YOU SAY OUR ISOLATING AND WAITING TO DO YOUR CLUTS ON ONE DAY THE WEEK AND SOMETHING HAPPENS ON THAT DAY YOU MIGHT GO ANOTHER THIRTEEN DAYS NOW BEFORE TRAINING WENGN BETWEEN WORK OUTS AND THAT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN THE FREQUENCY WON'T BE HIGH NO UNLESS THE LOAD AND VOLUME ON THAT ONE DAY HIS TASPRONOMICALLY HIGH ITS IS NOT CON A HAPPEN SO WHILE IF YOU LOOK AT THE RESEARCH I'M FREQUENCY IN TERMS OF HOW MANY DAYS PER WEEK DOESN'T MATTER THAT MUCH AS LONG AS THE TOTAL LOAD AND FAILURE ARE EQUIVALENT PRACTICALLY IT'S A CHALLENGE S O IT IT'S HARD BECAUSE LIFE GETS IN THE WAY FOR MOST PEOPLE ESPECIALL IF YOUHAVE KIDS IN A JOB AN AN ALL THESE THINGS OF THER SO I ACTUALLY PREFER DOING SOMETHING MORE LIKE THREE DAYS A WEEK OF TOTAL BODY AND IF SOMETHING HAPPENS YOU'VE JUST MIST THAT BODY PART FOR FORTENT HOURS SEVENTY TWO HOURS I LIKE THAT LITTLE BETTER FOR MOST PEOPLE NOT BECAUSE IT'S MORE EFFECTIVE BUT JUST BECAUSE IIT'S A LITTLE BUT MORE RESILIENT TO LIFE AND YOU CAN GET THERE IF YOU WANTED TO ACTUALLY DO A LITTLE BIT OF ACCOMBINATION SO IF YOU WANTED TO DO LIKE TWO DAYS A WEEK OF WHOLE BODY AND THEN TWO DAYS A WEEK OF A LTTLE BIT OF A BODY PART SPLIT THAN YOU'RE ACTUALLY SORT OF HEDGING AGAINST ALL RISKS THER IS LONG AS YOU GET TO THAT TOTAL NUMBER THERE NOW THERE IS ACTUALLY SOME EVIDENCE IN A COUPLE WAYS THAT MAY BE A LITTLTE MORE FREQUENTLY IS LITTLE BIT BETTER BUT THE DIFFICULTY'S NOW I GOING BACK TO THE PRACTICALITY QUESTION IF LIKE HOW MANY PEOPLE REALLY CAN TRAIN JUST THEIR STRAINGT TRAINING SIX DAYS A WEEK  THAT DOESN'T COUNT ANY OF THEIR LONG DURATION STUFF IT ISN'T H THEIR HIGH HEART RATE THEIR FLEXIBILITY THER IT'S JUS REALLY REALLY REALLY HARD TO GET ON THAT STUFF AN SO IT IS IT TENDS TO BE EASIER ON FOLKS AND TRIMS OF EXECUTION AND LONG TERM ADHERENTS IN MY OPINION TO GET THAT VOLUME ACCOMPLISH IN IN A LITTLE BUT MORE FREQUENT PATTERANS BUT NOT ONCE A WEEK SO I LI LIKE TO KIND OF HAVE IT RIGHT THERE FOR MOST PEOPLE NOT AGAIN NOT BECAUSE IT IS TECHNICALLY ON  MORE EFFECTIVE BUT BECAUSE YOU'R LESS LIKELY TO FAILE TO PROGRESS BECAUSE OF SKIPPING A WORK OUT SOMETHING POPPING UP YOU'RE POWER GOING OUT IN YOUR YOU KNOW CARAD STORY BEING LOCKED ON YOUR WOULD  IMAGINE THAT THAT HAPPEN TO BE THIS MORNING FOLKS CAN AT MY DRY WEEK IS A GAT THE ELECTRONIC GAT WIT A DOWN BECAUSE THE POWER IS DOWN ANY WAY SOLVE THAT PROBLEM YET THE WAY YOU DESCRIBE IT MY SENSE IS THAT WORK OUSE WILL LAST SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ONE IN TWO HOURS OF REAL WORK IS THAT ABOUT RIGHT IT DOESNT HAVE TO BE KNEAW YOU THAT LONG A YOU COULD CERTAINLY GET ENOUGH TO WORK DONE IN THIRTY MINUTES IF YOUVE DIN A WHOLE BODY WORK OUT YE I ABSOLUTELY SO IF YOIF YOU DOING THAT THREE DAYS A WEEK SO REMEMBER THE NUMBERS WERE TRYING TO HIT HERE LET'S THEY WERE TRYING TO HIT FIFTEEN WORKING SETS FOR MUSCLE GROUP PER WEEK THAT'S FIVE WORKING SETS PER DAY FOR MUSCLE GROUP SO IF YOU DID ONE EXERCISE FOR THAT DILLESATED SQUATS UTED FIVE SETS YOU DID AT THREE DAYS WEEK YOU'RE DONE THERE'SYOURE FIFTEEN BUT THERE ARE OTHER MUSCLE GROUPS TO HIT ON THAT SAME DAY YOU'R OING SQUATS  YOURE DOING WHOLE WHOLE BODY YESO YOU OU'VE GOTTEN HIM ALREADY AND SO LIKE ALL LEG MUSCLES IN THAT EXAMPLE ARE AR TAKEN CARE OF AH SO YOU WOULD NOT DO SEPARATE HAMSTRING WORK AND S YOU WOULDN'T NEED TO NOW IHANDSTERINGS IS ACTUALLY LITTL BT OF A CAVIET LIKE THAT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE OF AN EXERCISE ARE A MUSCLE GROUP THT'S PROBABLY REALLY GOOD TO MAKE FURE YOU ISOLY IT'S CHALLENGING TO GET WITH YOUR STANDARD A DEAD LIFT AN AND SQUAT IT IT'S ONE OF THE PROBALE ONE IT'S MOST IMPORTAT TO GO TARGET OUTSIDE THAT BUT IN THER THEYE REDICALLY THOUGH OUTSIDE OF THAT YOUO'LD GET MOST OF YOUR LEG MUSCLES DONE WITH EVEN A SINGLE EXERCISE AND EVEN IF YOU WANTED TO CHANGE IT UP SO YOU SAID AREIT MONDAY I'M OIN TO DO A SQUAT VARIATION AWEDNESDAY HE NEXT DAY LEFT I'M GOING TO DO SOME SORT OF D D LIFT HINGING VARIATION AND THEN MAYBE FRIDAY MY THIRD DAY I'MINH TO DO SOME SORT OF UNALATERAL I MAYBE REAREFITELOF ANY SPLISCAL ATER SOMETHING LIKE THAT RIGHT MAYBE EVEN A LATERAL LUNGE MAYBE DIFFERENT PLAIN OOK AT YOUREN A PRETTY GOOD SPOT YOU'REGIN TO HIT MOST OF THOSE MUSCLES I TO YOU'RE FIFTEEN WORKING SETS ESPECIALLY IF YOU TAKE SORT OF THAT LAST SET EACH DAY THE PRETTY CLOSE TO FAILURE THAT'S GONG TO GET SOME MORE SERIOUS WORK DONE BUT YOURE NOT CAN BE SO FATIGUE YOU CAN'T COME BACK IN TRAIN IT A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER AND YOU'LL BE FINE SO YOU GET EVENSPUT TAT UP INTO TWO DAYS WEEK AND NOW ALL YOU REALLY HAVE TO DO IS IT SOMETHING LIKE SEVEN WORKING SETS SO MAYBE THAT'S TWO EXERCISES PER DAY MAYBE SOME SORT OF LEG PRESS AND A LEG HINGE YO A THREE TO FOUR SETS EACH YOU NET SIX TO EIGHT SAT'S THAT DAY YOU'D THAT THREE IS A WEEK NOW'LL SEND YOU'RE AT THAT TWENTY TWENTY FOUR SETS MOTDYING BEN  SAME THE L YOR PR BODY I JUST CGAVE LORER BY EXAMPLESES  I LIKE THE LORD BODY ORESO I IT'S NOT THAT CHALLENGING TO GET TO THOSE NUMBERS AND SPLIT AND THAT THOSE WORK OUTS CAN BE EXTREMELY SHORT SO IF YOU'R IF YOU WERE DOING THAT THREE DAYS A WEEK I YOU KNW YOU'R  GOING YOU'RE DOING THAT ONE EXERCISE EVERYBODY ON'E EXERCISE LOWER BODY THAT CERTAINLY SHOULDN'T TAKE MORE AN FORTY MINUTES I'M HAPPY TO HEAR THAT NOT BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE TRAINING  PRES PLEASE EXCUSE THE DOUBLE NEGATIVE BUT I'VE FOUND THAT RESISTANCE TRAINING WORK OUTS THAT EXTEND LONGER THAN ONE HOUR OF WORK AND CERTAINLY LONGER THAN SEVENTY FIVE MINUTES OF WORK LEAVE ME VERY FATIGUED OH SIR AND FATIGUE TO THE POINT WHERE CONCENTRATING ON COGNIVE WORK THROUGHOUT THE DAY IM CAN BE CHALLENGING MET A LONGER NAFP IN THE AFTERNOON OM A BIG PROPONEV NAPS IN THE AFTERNOON IN ANY CASE BUT REQUIRING LONGER NAPS IN THE AFTERALION ET CETERA SO AT LEAST FOR ME RESTRICTING THE RESISTANCE TRAINING WORK OUTS TO ABOUT FIFTY FIVE ZERO TO SIXTY MINUTES OF REAL WORK YE FOR ME THREE OR FOUR TIMES FER WEEK HAS HELP TREMENDOUSLY SO IT'S A CASE WERE DOING HIRER INTENSY WORK IN A SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME AND ASSHALY HITTING MUSCLE GROUPS LESS FREQUENTLY FOR ME THATS AGAIN ONCE DIRECTLY ONCE IN DIRECTLY YE AS WORKED REALLY WELL AND  AS YOU MENTION EARLIER THIS COULD VERY WELL BE EXPLAINE BY NOT MY RECOVERY QUOTINT AS ON A SORT OF A GENETIC OR PHYSIOLOGICAL VARIABLE BUT THE WAY THAT I'M TRAINING AND INDEED I LIKE TO DO A FEW FOUR STRAPS AND GO TO FAILURE ON TARE SATS IN THE ANOTHER LEANED IN THAT IN THAT OM JONER OF TRAINING IT'S TH LITTL FUN LIKE TICH JUS TRAIN HARD IT IS RALLY FON IT IS I THINK THAT I'M I'VE LEARNED A LOT BY TRAINING TO QUOTIN TO FAILURE QOROM I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF LEARNING IN THERE I'M PROVIDED ITS DONE SAFELY BUT WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING ACTUALLY INSPIRES ME TO AT LEAST GIVE A TRY TO THESE OTHER SORTS OF SPLITS AND AND WAYS OF TRAINING FOR HYPERTROPHE AN STRENGTH BECAUSE THIS NOTION OF NOT NESERELY HAVING YOU GO TO FAILURE AND STILL BEING ABLE TO VOKE STRAINGTH AND HYPERTROPHY IM ADAPTATIONS IS A REALLY A INTRIGUING ONE I DARE I EVEN SAY A SEDUCTIVE ONE AND THAT LEADS ME TO A QUESTION THAT IS BASED ON FINDINGS THAT I'VE HEARD DISGUST ON SOCIAL MEDIA WHICH MEANS VERY LITTL IF ANYTHING UNLESS IT'S IN THE CONTECTS OF PEOPLE WHO REALLY OF NO EXERCISE SIENCE AND ON YOURE ONE SUCH PERSON AND THT'S THIS IDEA THAT BECAUSE RESISTANCE TRAINING CAN EVOKE APPROACHING SYNTHESIS ADAPTATION RESPONSE BUT THAT ADAPTATION RESPONSE IS LAST ABOUT FORTY EIGHT HOURS BEFORE IT STARTS TO TAPER OFF THAT THE IDEAL IN QUOTES FREQUENCY FOR TRAINING AN GIVEN MUSCLE GROUP FOR HPERTROPHY IS ABOUT EVERY FORTY EIGHT HOURS IS THAT TRUE YES AND NO SO A COUPLE OF THINGS THERE REMEMBER IN ORDER TO GROW A MUSCLE THERE'S MULTIPLETUPS HERE SO YOU HAVE THE SIGNALING RESPONSE WHICH ACTUALLY HAPPENS WITHIN SECONDS OF EXERCISE AND CAN LAST DEPENDING ON THE MARKER  UP TO AN HOUR OR TWO HOURS STAP NUMBER TOO THEN IS GENE EXPRESSION AND W WE SEE THAT THAT'S TYPICALLY PIQED AROUND TWO TO SIX HOURS POST EXERCISE AND TON YOU HAVE FOLLOWING THAT PROTINE SYNTHESIS AND THAT'S THAT LONGTIME FORAME SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWELVE HOURS THERE IT'S CERTAINLY NOT PIQUED FOR FORTY EIGHT HOURS IT MAY BE STILL THERE FORTYEIHT HOURS FROM NOW BUT IT IS IS ABSOLUTELY COMING DOWN AT THAT POINT DEPENDING ON SERVEAN OMER FACTORS SO THAT THAT PART OF HIS SORT OF TRUE SO THAT THAT THIS IS A COMMINATION OF LIKE SOME HALF TRUCE IN THE SOME LIKE MAY BE JUST PEDANTIC THINGS THAT AREN'T REALLY THAT PORT A DIFFERENTIATE THE WE REAL QUESTION I THINK IS IS HIT OKA IS IT AL CAY TO TRAIN SOONER SLASH IS AT BETTER TO TRAIN SOONER OR ACTUALLY'S A BETTER TO WAIT LONGER THERE'S NO REAL REASON TO THINK THAT YOU NEED TO TRAIN IF THE GOLD IS SYPEERTROPHY ANY SOONER THAN FORTYIGHT HOURS AFTERWARDS I CAN'T THINK OF AN ADVANTAGE THAT THAT WOULD CONFER I I ALSO CAN'T THINK OF ANY PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS ATHLEDS PHYSIQUE BODY BUILDERS COACHES THAT EVER FOUND TREMENDOUS SUCCESS DOING THAT SO I WOULD BE VERY SCEPTICAL THAT THAT IS AT ANY WAY BETTER NOW COULD YOU DO IT IN SOME INSTANCES OF SAY YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT TRAVEL COMING UP LIKE THAT SO THAT YOU JUST SUSPECT YET ONE OF FREELOAD THE SYSTEM BY DESTROYING THE HOL NO PROT IN THEN WAITING SEVEN DAYS OR FOURTEEN DAYS I'VE KNOWN PEOPLE HAVE DONE THAT BEFORE I DO NO CATIONS OR LAY IEVERY TIME LIKE EVERY SINGLE I ANNIHILATE THEMSELVES AND THEN TAKE IT OLY LAY OFF YET AND IT'S LIKE THERE'S NO BENEFIT THERE OTHER THAN PSYCHOLOGICAL LIKE I JUST LOVE IT IT FEELS GREAT TO BE SUPERSORE I FEEL LESS CRAPPY NOT TRAINING FOR THOSE COUPLEDAYSCOMIC OB SUPERSORRING YOU NEED THE EXTENDED REST YET OF COURSE AND ITS DIS LIKE IT IS JUST A CRAPPY JUSTIFICATION IN MY BRAIN THAT LIKE I EXCUSE TO DO SOMETHING REALLY WILD AND I TOLLY DON'T NEED AND GET WAYTSOR THAT I SHOULD GET DOCTOR ANDY YALBAN SUGGESTIONS OF WHAT NOT TO DO BUT THAT HE DOES A HUNDRED PER CENT OIS I SAY NOT AS I DO THE FAMOUS WORDS OF EVERY RESEARCH PROVEN YET I THINK FORTY EGT HOURS IS A REASONABLE TIME AT TO WAIT CAN'T THINK OF ANY ADVANAGE GOING SOONERTHAN THAT THERE'S REALLY NOT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF ADVANTAGE OF WAITING MUCH LONGER THAN THAT CERTAINLY SEVENTY TO OURS IS FINE IS LONG AS YOU'RE HITTING THESE CONCEPTS WE TALKED ABOUT YOU CAN LET REALLY LIFE DETERMINE THAT THA MEAN THERE SITUATIONS TO IT WIT LIKE A PARTICULAR ATHLEES WHERE WE HAVE TO CONT O BREAK THAT BECAUSE OF SCHENDRAL OBLIGATIONS THEY'RE PLAYING EVERY FIFTH DAY EVERY THIRD DAR SON LIKE THAT YOU'R JUST GON HAVE TO LIFT O BACK TO BACK DAYS N YUSE CON HAVE TO GET DONE I'M BUT YET I CAN'T THINK OF WHY OUD GO OUT OF MY WAIGH DO THAT THE SECOND PART OF THAT QUESTION IS LET'S SAY SOMEBODY TRAINS A MUSCLE THEY TRAIN IT PROPERLY THE HID AN APPROPRIATE REP RANGES AN APPROPRIATE REST ET CETERA THAT THE STIMULUS IS THERE THE ADAPTATION IS SET IN MOTION THEY'RE GETING SOME WHERER SOMEWHERE AT FORTY EIGT HOURS OR SO A PROACHING SYNTHESIS WEEK THAT'S GOING TO TAPER OFF YBUT THEY DON'T TRAIN IT FORTY EIGHT HOURS LATER OR SEVENTY TO OURS LATER THEY TRAIN IT FIVE OR SIX DAYS LATER NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE LAZY NOT BECAUSE THEY U THEY DON'T CARE BUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE OTHER PRIORITIES AT AR WOVEN IN WITH I THEY T APERTROPHY IN THIS MUSCLE I THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO EXIST ONLY TO GET HYPERTROPHY AN A HEVEN MUSCLE GROUP BUT TET'S BE FAIR MOST PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO GROW THAT MUSCLE GROUP BUT THEN DOES IT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE MUSCLE STARTS TO REVERT TO ITS PREHYPEROTROPHIC STATE THAT IS DOES IT ATROPHY AND GET SMALLER AGAIN BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T I COULD SEE A LOT OF REASONS FOR HITTING A MUSCLE GROUP ONCE EVERY FIVE DAYS OR SEVEN DAYS PROVIDED YOU HOLD ON TO THE HYPERTROFOR YO THAT YOU INITIATED FIVE OR SEVEN DAYS AGO YET THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK YOU WILL LOSE ANYTHING IN THAT SORT OF A TIME TO MAIN FIVE TO SEVEN DAYS THE ONLY CHALLENGE WITH TRAINING THAT INFREQUENTLY IS CAN YOU ACTUALLY GET ENOUGH TOTAL VOLUME DONE SO IF YOU'RE GING TO TRAIN THE MUSCLE ONCE A WEEK YOU EITHER HAVE TO GO TO REAL FAILURE REAL DAMAGE IN SORENESS OR YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT AWAY TO TWENTY SETS THAT DAY IN THA MUSCLE NOT AT ALL IMPOSSIBLE ESPECIALLEVERYTHING WELL ACTUAL I HAVE YOU THIS FIFTEEN HAVE I DO FIVE SETS OF THREE EXERCISES THAT'S NOT OUTRAGEOUS NOT AT ALL SO SO LIKE ABSOLUTE POSSIBLE IF YOU'RE WANTING TO GO MORE TOWARDS TWENTY ORE GETTING CLOSER THAT TWENTY FIVE NOW IT STARTS TO GET PRETTY CHALLENGING SO I SCIENTIFICALLY THE RESEARCH WALL SUGGEST IT'S GOING TO BE EQUALLY EFFECTIVE PRACTICALLY IT'S CHALLENGING FOR PEOPLE TO GET SUFFICIENT VOLUME WITHOUT JUST BEING SO DEMORALIZED AFTERWARDS BECAUSE THE'REIN SO MUCH PAIN THEY CAN'T ET OUT OF OUR CAR THER THEIR LEGS ARE SO TRASHS THEY CAN'T SET IN THE TOILET AND GET BACK UP WITHOUT CRYING  FROM PAIN SO AT'S NOT GOOD NO THAT'S NOT I SAY THAT CAUSE THOSE R ACTUAL EXAMPLES THAT HAVE HAPPENED IN MY LIFE YI I REALIZING AS WE'RE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT WASE TO STIMULATE HYPERTUR FEE THAT I'VE SORE DEFAULTED TO MORE INTENSITY IS SUPPOSED TO VOLUME BECAUSE OF THE TIME FACTOR I HAVE LOT OF OTHER THINGS GOING ON IN MY LIFE AND SO WITHIN THAT HOUR I CAN'T GET ENOUGH SETS IN ACROSS ALL THE MUSCLE GROUPS ANN TO HIT AND I'M ONLY CAN DO IT ABOUT ONCE A WEEK AND SO IT'S AT LEAST FOR ME MERE ADVANTAGEOUS TO JUST TRAIN EXTREMELY HARD I SHOULD USE THE PRE EXHAUSTION TECHNIQUE THAT YOU MENTION BEFORE YET OUR PREFATIGUE AS YO REFERRED TO IT OF ITTING SOMETHING REALLY STRONG WITH AN ISOLATION EXERCISE THAN DOING COMPOUND EXERCISES I'M STRYING TO THINK THAST ON WHAT YOU'VE TOLD ME THAT PRE FATIGUE AND THEN A COMPOUND EXERCISE IN SOME WAYS IT'S NOT REALLY TWO SETS BECAUE IF YOU'RE GOING TO FAILURE IN HORSE STRAPS YOU'RE COPUSHING PAST FAILURE THEN YOU'RE DOING A COMPOUND EXERCISE AND YOU'RE DOING THAT TWO OR THREE TIMES WELL THAT SOUNDS LIKE FOUR TO SIX SETS BUT THE FOURCE REPETITIONS ARE ALMOST LIKE AN ADDITIONAL SET  YET AND SO IT'S NOT TWENTY SETS BUT IT'S FOUR TO SIX REALLY REALLY HARD SETS THAT GO BEYOND WHAT WE NORMALLY THINK OF AS A SET TOTALLY OKATES IS SORELY A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RUNNING ON CONCRETE AND RUNNING ON ONE HAND WHAT I DONT UP FOR A SAND RUN IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE TOTALLY YEAND THIS IS WHY I SHOULDN'T MENTION THIS THE VERY VERY BEGINNING OF OR OUR CHAT TO DAY BUT ALL OF THESE NUMBERS THAT'LL GIVE YOU FOR ANY EXERCISE ATAPTATION YOU YOU YOU CANNOT THINK OF THEM AS HARD LINES THEY ARE GRADIANS AND SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE NUMBER FOR IE PERCRIYOU THEN TERMS OF REPETITIONS I SAIT FOUR TO THIRTY WHOULD HOU THINK HAPPENS AT THREE YOU THINK I PERTREG TO STOPS IN FACT THE NUMBER YOU'LL SEEN LITERATUREIS MORE LIKE SIX TO THIRTY I ACTULY SLIGHTE IT DOWN TO FOUR THOUGH THET PERSONAL PREFENCE BECAUSE THAT BUT IT JUST FADE SOAY WHATD HE THINK APPENS AT RE THIRTY ONE THIRTY FIVE THISNES IT JUST FADES RAGELLY OVER TIME SO YOU ACTUAS WOET HAV BROUGHT THIS UP WHEN IN YOUR QUESTIONS AND I'M NOT SURE IF YOU ARE U THINKING ABOUT THIS OR MAYBE YOU WERE I JUS BABBLED ON ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE BUT IF STRENGTH HAPPENS BETWEEN THIS LIKE ONE TO FIVE REPETITION RANGE AND I PERTROPHY TYPICALLY HAPPENS IN THIS LIKE EIGHT TO THIRTY RANGE WHAT HAPPENS IF I REREDUE TO SETS OF SIX OR GOD FORBID SEVEN LIKE SEVEN AND NINE ARE THESE NUMBERS YOU JUST ABSOLUTE DON'T DO IN STRANGTH TRAINING PRASE IS  SHAT'S ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX GOT EIGHT TEN TWELVE LIKE DO NOT PROGRAM A SET AF THIRD NOWN I'M TRAIN SETS OF SEVEN AND NIEED WELL USE SAT'S A SEVEN ALLOT M WITH WALENTRICE CAUSE YOU CN ACTUALLY COUNT NUMBERS MORFACT THE LYBIT BUT WHAT HAPPENS IN SEVENTY NINE GRANGES SO THIS IS ACTUALLY WONDERFUL AREA OF THESE LIKE FIVE TO EIGHT REPETITIONS WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO GET A NICE COMBINATION OF A LOT OF STRENGTH GAINS AND A LOT OF HYPERTROPHE SO SOME ONE IS COMING IN GOING MAN I WANTAGE STRONGER AND A ONE AD MUSCLE WHAT DO I DO HERE WILL THA'S ACTUALLY REALY NICE ANSWER TRAIN PRETTY HARD IN THAT LIKE FOUR TO EIGHT REPETITION RANGE AND YOU'RE GOING TO GET A LOT STRONGER AND YOU'LL STILL UNDUCE A LOT OF HYPERTROPHE IF YOU WANT TO REALLY MAXIM IHYPERTROPHE I WOULD PROBABLY SPEND MOST OF YOUR TIME IN THE EIGHT TO FIFTEEN REPETITION PER SET RANGE YOU CAN GO UP TO THIRTY ADMITTEDLY THOUGH I DON'T THINK IT'S OPTINABLE TO SPEND MOST OF YOUR TIME AT MORE THAN FIFTEEN RAPSPR SET IT'S VERY CHALLENGING TO MAINTAIN THE FOCUS REQUIRED AT RAP TWENTY SEVEN TO ACTUALLY GET SUFFICIENT FAILURE BY RETHIR THE YOU JUST YOU JUST GIVE AP WOIN TOHR IT'S HARD TO DO THE SAME THING AT THE BOTTOM AND THAT SPECTRUM I'M TERMS OF OF REALLY HEAVY TO GET THERE SO I REALLY HONESTLY THINK EIGHT TO FIFTEEN IS STILL IT'S CLEY SHADES THAT TEXPECT NUMBER BUT TIT'S A REASON THAT'S A TECTMIC IT IS TRIED AND TRUE AND VERY VERY VERY EFFECTIVE IF FOR INSTANCE YOU WANT TO GET STRONGER THOUGH AND NOT IN VOK A LOT OF HYPERTROPHY YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF TRICKS YOU CAN PULL NEVER ONE STAY SOUTH OF THAT FIVE REPETITION RANE YOU DO SETS OF ONE SET OF TO GO AS HEAVY AS YOU CAN WITH AAPPROPRIATE CONSIDERATIONS AN STICK WITHIN IT MAY BE EVEN UP TO THREE REPS PERSET YOU STRIVE GETTING TO FOUR TO FIVE TO SIX NIAGNASTRAN ITCHING TOWARDS THAT THAT HYPERTRE ARRNE SO STAY DOWN THERE DO A LOT MORE TOTAL SETS SO DO A CLASS EXAMPLE WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE EIGHT SETS OF THREE RI YU CAN TO GET A LOT OF PRACTICE YOU CAN GET TWENTY FOUR VERY HIGH QUALITY RAPTS WITH A LOT OF REST IN BETWEEN  YOU GO FROM THERE YOU GO TO MANAGING COLORIC INTAKE MAKING SURE YOU PROACHING IS STILL ON POINT YOU ONT A RECOVER BUT IF YOU'RE TOTAL CALLORIES AREN'T A NO GREATER THAN TEN TO FIFTEEN PER CENT ABOVE YOUR MAINTENANCE NEEDS THEN YOU'RE NOT NG TO BE ABLE TO PUT ON A WHOLE BUNCH OF MUSSCLEMASKY SYO JUST DON'T HAVE THE FUEL FOR YOU CAN ALSO THEN SPACE YOUR WORK OUTS OUT SO THAT STIMIS ISN'T COMING EXTREMELY OFTEN SO IF YOU DO THAT THING A COUPLE OF TIMES A WEEK IT'S NOT ENOUGH FREQUENCY AND THAT SIGNAL SO REMEMBER THAT SIGNAL HAS TO BE FREQUENT OR LOUD YOU DIDN'T MAKE IT SUPERLOUD AND NOWRE NOW MAKING A SUPERFREQUENT YOU CAN GET VERY VERY VERY STRONG LIKE THAT AND IN PUT ON VERY LOW AMOUNC OF HYPERTRET IF THAT'S SORT OF THE CHOICE SO YOU TOLD US A LOT ABOUT VOLUME AND FREQUENCY AND HOW THAT RELATES TO PROATING SYNTHESIS AN RECOVERY TO EVOKE THE HYPERTRIVI ADAPTATION RESPORNIN HOW SHOULD PEOPLE THINK ABOUT SYSTEMIC DAMAGE IN RECOVERY BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THE WAYIT INTERACTS WITH THE NOR MUSCULAR SYSTEM IS THE SIGHT OF ALL THE ACTION HERE WORLE HAVE A LOT OF THE ACTION  AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEM CAN IN FACT BECOME FATIGUED YVIDBEON I HAS A GREAT CAPACITY BUT THE WHOLE SYSTEM THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT CAN BE WORKED TO THE EXTENT THAT EVEN IF A MUSCLE GROUP LIKE THE BYSEPS OR THE BACK IS BEING ALLOWED TO RAST WHILE YOUR TRAINING LEGS IND OTHER MUSCLE GROUPS THAT YOUR WHOLE NEUROW MUSCULAR SYSTEM NEEDS REST HOW DOES ONE DETERMINE WHETHER NOT YOUR ENTIRE BODY NEEDS COMPLETE REST OR OR LOW LEVEL ACT TOV REST OR EXERCISE OF A DIFFERENT KIND EA ASSURE SO I WANTOT ACTUALLY TACKLE IS CAUSE WE'RE ON THE TOPIC OF HYPERTROPHY I'M ASSUMING THAT THAT'S THE GOAL IN MIND HERE YES YOU'RE IM ASKING SPECIFICALLY WITH RIGHT OBJECTS OF HYPERTROPHY I REALIZE THAT FOR OTHER TRAINING GOLLS THE ANSWER THIS QUESTION COULD BE QUITE DIFFERET OL SO WE ACTUALLY USEINT COUPLE OF FRENTWAYS LET START LOCAL AND WORK BACK TO SYSTOMACH RIGHT BECAUSE A NEVER ONE WHAT YOU'RE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT IS AT THE LOCAL MUSCLE LEVEL IS THEM I GET A CREAT ACCESSOVE DAMAGE AND I DON'T NES SARLY MEAN MUSCLE DAM TRIMING INJURY RT SO I'M THE CETTARULTH ONLY USES LIKE THREE OT O TEN AN TRIMS OF SORENESS IF YOU'RE MORE THAN THREE UT OF TEN AN TRIMS OF SORENESS LOTEST ARE TO ASKING QUESTIONS IF YOU'RE HIGHER THAN SIX AT A TEN WERE PROBABLY NOT TRAINING THIS IS SUBJECTIVE  TOTAL SUBJECTIVE MEASURE RIGHT AND YOU'LL YOU'LL KNOW VERY QUICKLY RIGHT IF YOU LIKE IF YOU CAN BEAR LY GRAZE YOURE PECK WITH YOUR FINGER TIP AND IN YIK AH I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SQUORE THAT WERE NOT TRAING THERE'S IS NO DAMG IF YOU'RE THREE AT A TEN IF YOUST LIKE I'M KIND OF LIKE A LITTLE BIT STIFF HERE BUT WHEN' YHU GET WARMED UP YOU  SARFON O K YOU'RE PROBABLY O K TO PROCEEDTER SO THAT IS IS A VERY EASY WAY TO JUST THINK ABOUT SORNIS YOU GONG TO BE A LIT A BIT TIGHT TOF ANY ON TRAIN FREQUENCY NOW ZUMING OUT TOS SYSTEMAC WE USE HAE WHOLE HOST OF THINGS SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE A AA WHOLE HOST OF BOW MARKERS WE OUS SEON GET A LOTOF THES FROM BLOOD SO YOU CAN LOOK AT THINGS LIKE CREETIN KINAE THAT'S THE VERY COMMON ONE MARKER OF MUSCLE DAMAGE 'M WE'LL ACTUALLY LOOK AT I ELL THE AGE WILL OOK A MILE GLIBULANE IM THAT'S JIST LIKE YOUVE THING ABA HEMOGLOBAN IS THE I IIS THE MALLCULE TH CARRY'S OCTION THROUGOUT YOUR BLOOD A MIL GLOBIN IS THE THE PART OFTHAT THAT'S ACTUALY IN MUSCLE SO WHEN MUSCLE IT'S BROKEN DOWN THAT GET SLEEKED OUT PUTTING YOUR BLOOD THAT'S ONE OF THE  MARKERS ACTUALLYS CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH THNGS LIKE RABDO WHICH IS A YOU YOU'RETO SEE YOU YEARN IS PURPLE IT'S EXTREMELY DARK BECAUE YOU GOT SO MUCH MUSCLE BREAK DOWN THT AT HAPPENS AND GENNEY'S GO HAVE A PROBIN YOU PUT A MUCH IS UP IN THEIRE SO WE USE THOSE MILE MARKERS WE'RL OCUALY ALSO LOOK AT A PROBABLY COUBLE THINGS ARE YOUR FAMILIAR WITH AL T AND AC ITHESE ARE EXCELLENT MILE MARKERS OF MUSCLE BREAK DOWN SO IF WE ARE ACTUALLY SUSPECTING THAT THIS IS A CHRONIC PROBLEM I'M WORGAN ACTUALLY GO ANMIN PULSI BLOOD IIF ITS JUST LIKE I'M SUPERSORT TODAY WERCAN USE THAT SUBJECT OR MARKER BUT IF WE'RE SEEING THIS IS CONSTANT LIKE MAN ARE WE REALLY PUSHING YOU WAY TOO MUCH IS THERE'E SOME SORT OF SYSTEMIC PROBLEM I'M MORE GOING TO BLOOD AN ER LOOK AT ALL THOSE DIFFERENT THINGS NOW  A S T TOAL T IS IS REALY SPECIFIC AND I DON'T WANT TO TAKE US TOO FAR OFF TRACK HERE BUT THE RATIO TOF THOSE THINGS IS ACTULLY VERY IMPORTANT S WELL SO  IF YOU LOOK AT THE A  T TO L T RATIO TYPICALLY THE NUMBER WILL LOOK AT US LIKE ONE POINT SIX SEVEN AS THAT RATIO IS LIKE HIER THAN THAT YOU HAVE A PRETTY HIGH RISK OF MUSCLE DAMAGE BUT REALLY BETWEEN OU MENOU AND A FEW OF THESE LISTENERS ANY TIME WE STARSEING S T OUT KICK AL T WERE IMMEDIATELY THINK AS AN RACHA BEING HIGHER THAN ONE I'M REMEDALLY THINKING THAT THERE'S SOMETHING HAPPENING MUSCLE DAMAGE WHY SO I MET'S ACTUALLY THINK YOU COETD INDICATOR OF JUST TOTAL MUSCLEMASS IBECAUSE THE FAST MEJORY THAT'S CAN BE IN MUSCLE SO I'M THOSE ARE ACTUALLY SOME MARKERS THAT WE LIKE A LOT IF MUSCLE DAMAGE IS A THE THING WORE CONCERNED WITH IF WE ARE MORE CONCERNED WITH THINGS LIKE WHOTAL TRAINING VOLUME SYSTEMAC OVERLOWD THEN WE MAY TURN TO SOMETHING MORE LIKE SLEEP THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION WE CAN ACTUALLY GET GLANE FROM CHANGES IN SLEEP I BEHAVIOUR IN FUNCTION IM YOU CAL ALSO LOOK AT THINGS LIKE H R V HARTRY VERY BILITY WHICH IS A VERY CLASSIC MARKER AND MUCH MORE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES W TRAINING THAN SOMETHING LIKE A RESTING HAR RATE I WHICH IS WHICH IS ONE THING YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO THAT'S TOTALLY COST FREE JUSTLOOK AT YOUR CHANGES AND ANY ELEVATION RESTING HAR RATE OVER TIME ESPECIUALLY MORE THAN THREE TO FIVE CONSECUTIVE DAYS IT IS INDICATOR BUT  ARV IS MUCH MORE SENSITIVE I'M TWO THINGS LIKE TRAINING IN DUCED OVERLOOD SO THAT'S A QUICK VERSION OF STUFF THAT WERKIN A PAYATTENTION DO THE LAST ONE I WOULD AB THERE IS SIMPLY MOTIVATION SO IIF YOU'RE REALLY TRAINING HEARTING YOU LIKE TRAINING HEART AND YOU JUST LIKE CANNOT FORCE YOURSELF TO GOIN YOU MORE THAT AND OF ITSELF CAN BE A GOOD NICATION OF IT MAY BE NOT THE DAY MAY BE NOT THE WEEK I'M WITH ALL OF THESE THINGS YOU WANT TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT OVER REACTING TO A SINGLE DAY MEASURE AGAIN WE T WE NEED TO LOOK OUT AT LEAST A TREND OF MORE THAN THREE DAYS HONESTY ON LOOKING OT MORE THAN FIVE DAYS I'M OMINAPLL BACK FROM THAT AND THINK ABOUT WHAT PHASE OF TRAINING WERE IN WHAT PART OF THE YEAR WEREIN TIPICO TOR AT THETORING IN SEASON PRESEASAN POSTSEAS AND OFFSEES IN ET CENTRA TO MAKE OUR DECISION ABOUT WHAT WERE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT ARE WE CANNING THE ENTIRE WORK OUT ARE WE DO ON MODIFIED LORVERSION OR INTENSITY I'M MI DEFAULT GENERALLY IF HI ERCHFESE THE GOAL REMEMBER VOLUME IS THE DRIVER THERE SO IF I CAN CAN WE GET IN CAN WE GO REAL LIGHT LET'S GO TO SIX OT A TEN OR PE SO RELATIVE PERCEIVED EXERTION MAYBE WILL REDUCE THE RANGE OF MOTION MAYBE WOOL MAKE A LITOT OF IT EASIER MAY BEGO TO MACHINES OR INSTEAD OF GOING A SQUAT WILL DUSDU NO A LE SENTIOSONMING LIKE THAT BUT I WANT STIY'LL GET ENOUGH VOLUME IN THERE THAT WILL KEEP YOU ON TARGET AN ANYA GAIN EVEN GOING AT FIFTY PER CENT NOT NOT TO HIGH REPETITION YO FIFTY PER CENT FOR A CENT O TEN THREE CETS IS GET ANICE BUFLO HEN THERE GETTIT AND GET IT OUT AIDN RECOVERY AND THEN MOVE ON AN COME BACK THE NEXT DAY THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT I WOULD DO RATHER THAN CANNING THE ENTIRE CESSION HOW DO OTHER FORMS OF EXERCISE COMBINE WITH HYPERT TRAINING FOR INSTANCE CAN I DO CARTY ASCULAR TRAINING FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS PER WEEK PROVIDED THAT CART ASCULAR TRAINING IS OF LOW ENOUGH INTENSITY AND NOT DISRUPT HYPERTROFY PROGRESSION AND CAN I DO THAT CART F ASCULAR EXERCISE BEFOR OR AFTER THE HYPERTRY TRAINING OR DOES IT NEED BE SEPARATED OUT THE ANSWER TO THIS IS REALLY WILL RECALL THE CROSS OVER OUR INTERFERENCE EFFECT IT'S REALLY AN ENERGY MANAGEMENT ISSUE SO THE ONLY TIME INDURANCE ECTRES ARE STARTS TO INTERFERE OR BLOCK OR HINDER TANYOUEIGHT HYPERCHAPY IS IN ONE OF TWO BROAD CHARACTERIES NEVER ONE TOTAL ENERGY IN TAKE OR YOUR BALANCE IS OFF SO YOU CAN AMILERATE THIS BY JUST EATING MORE IF YOU DO THAT THEN INTERFERENCE AFFECT GENERALLY GOES AWAY THE SECOND ONE IS YOU ANT O MACTURE YOU AVOID EXERCISE FORMS FOR YOUR ENDURANCE TRAINING THAT OR THE SAME WORKING GROUP AND SPECIFICALLY THE ECENTRIC PORTION SO FOR EXAMPLE WE SEE MUCH MORE INTERFERENCE WITH RUNNING ON LIKE HI PERCHABE THAN WE WE CYCLING WRIHT LESS ECENTRIC POUNDING AND LOADING LESS DAMAGE LESSINGS TO RECOVER FROM THE TISSUE SEEMS TO BE TOTALLY FINE THE ONLY OTHER THNGYOU YOU T WORRY ABOUT HERE IS TOTAL VOLUME OF YOUR ENDURANCE WORK SO IF YOURE DOING A A MODERATE INTENSITY FOR A MODERATE DURATION SAY SEVENTY PER CENT OF YOUR MAXIMUM HARRADE FOR TWENTY FIVE MINUTES IT'S UNLIKELY O DO MUCH DAMAGE ANDIN TERMS OF BLOCKING I PERTREATE YOUR TOTALLY FINE DOYOU CAN YOU DO IT BEFORE OR AFTER YOUR WORK OUT IT'S PROBABLY NOK IN A MATTER THAT MUCH ARE IT SO PRE FATIGUE IS O CAYFRI PERCHPE SO IF YOUR PR FATIGUE IS COMING FROM ENDURANCE THAN YOUR TOTALLY FINE NOT A BEDEAL AFTERWARDS COOL YOU ANT AO BREAK IT UP INTO MULTIPLE SESSION THAT'S PROBABLY BETTER RIGHT SO IF YOU DO YOUR ENDURANCE WORK ON A SEPARATE DAY THAT'S PROBABLY BEST CASE CINAREO IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT BUT YOU CAN BREAK IT UP INTO TWO WORK OUT SAY YOU LIFT IN THE MORNING THAN YOU DO YOUR CONICAL CARDIO AT NIGHT MAYBE THAT SECOND BEST THIRD BEST IS DOING IT AT THE END OF YOUR LIFT AND FINISHING IT THAT'S FINE TUS MAKE SURE THAT YOUR MAXIMISING YOUR RECOVERY ON ALL THE OTHER TRICKS WILL TALK ABOUT LATER MAKES SURE THE CAVAORIES ORE THERE MAKE SURE NOT DOING A LOT OF ECCENTRIC LANDING IN THAT ENDURAN STUFF AND YOU'LL BE JUST FINE AND WHERE DOES HIHER INTENSITY CARDIO FIT INTO A HYPERGHIF YOU PROGRAME SO I HIRANTENSY CARDIO O FOR INSTANCE IN MY MIND IS GETTING ON THE ASSAULT BY AND DOING OM YOU KNOW EIGHT INTERVALS OF TWENTY SECOND SPRINS IN TEN SECOND RATHERAND BETWEEN OR PERHAPS GOING TO FIELD AN DOING SOME BOUNDS IN SPRIN SANTHINGS O THAT SORT NOT GOING ALL OUT NOT A IN A RUNNING FOR ONE'S LIFE BUT YOU ETTING  UP TO BOUT YOU KNOW EIGHTY FIVE NINETY PER CENT OF OF RUNNING FOR ONE'S LIFE TO WE HAVE A LOTLESS INFORMATION ON THE POTENTIAL INTERFERENCE OR NOT OF HINTENSITIES OF IT UM THE SUFF WE DO HAVE SUGGESTED AND MAY ACTUALLY AID IN HYPERTROPHY AND THAT'S BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT ONE THE POTENTIAL PAT TO ACTIVATION A MUSCLE GROWTH IS THIS METABOLIC A DISTURBANCE YOU'RE GIG TO GET THAT A LOT WITH THE THE HINTENS ANERWILL THING SO IT'S NOT A TERRIBLE THING TO DO I WOULDN'T DO IT TO THE LEVEL THAT IT COMPROMISES YOUR ABILITY TO COME BACK INTO YOUR PRIMARY TRAINING SO YOU'R SO FATIGUE YOUR LEGS ARE SUPERHEAVY  THER TEPLEADED YOU NOW HAVE TO INJEST ACTRA CARBOHYRATES TO REPLENISH MOSCEL LIKE AGIN TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE BOTH RECOVERY AND CULTRAINING ET CETERA THAT COULD THEN LEAD YO A PROBLEM BUT IN GENERAL WE REALLY DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY THAT IS GOING TO COMPLETELY BLOCK OR OR MAKE IT SUCH THAT YOUR TRAINING WAS CONICL WASTED OR DIDN'T WORK AN FACT ACTUALLY A VERY RECENT A STUDY CAME OUT WERE THEY A HAD INDIVIDUALS PERFORM SIX WEEKS OF PURELY AROBIC ENDURANCE STEDY STAY LONGRATION ANDURANCE FOR SIX WEEKS I THINK PRIOR TO STARTING HYPERTRY FAS COMPARED THAT TO INDIVIDUALS WHO DID NOT DO THAT AND THOSE FOLKS THAT DID THESE SIX WEEKS OF JUST I THINK IT WAS CYCLING ACTUALLY JUST ENDURANCE WORK HAD MORE MUSCLE GROWTH AT THE END OF THEIR HYPERTRY TRAINING THAN THOSE FOLKS IT DID NOT SO THIS SHOWS YOU VERY CLEARLY THERE ARE A LOT OF ADVANTAGES THAT COME WITH BEING PHYSICALLY FIT TO GROWING MUSCLE SO FOLKS TAT ALSO A HAVE ACTUALLY HIT PLATEAU SO LOT ONE OF THE THINGS YOU MAY ACTUALLY SEE SOME BENEFIT FROM IS ACTUALLY DOING A WOODMENT MORE ENDURANCE WORK WHETHER IT'S A STEADY STATE STUFF MAYBE ASI OF THE HIRE INTENSITY STUFF I'M CERTAINLY IF YOU'R STARTING A TRAINING FACE IT'S A PRETTY GOOD IDEA TO DO THAT AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF OF PHYSIOLOGIC REASONS OF WHY THAT'S POTENTIALLY OCCURRING BUT THE THE LOWEST HANGING FRUIT HERE IS WEEK SORT OF JOK THEY YO' LIKE IF YOU'RE SO UNFIT THAT YOU'R TYING YOUR SHOES IN YOUR WARM UP AND YOU'R ALREADY BREAKING A SWET YOU PROBABLY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PHIS FITNESS TO DO ENOUGH TRAINING TO GET ENOUGH HI PERTRY SO THAT IS IN FACT YOUR LIMITING FACTOR YOU'RE NOT RECOVERING YOU'RE SUPERED  FATIGUED IN DAMAGED AND SORE BECAUSE YOU'RE SO UNFIT SO GET FIT FIRST AND THEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY GET MORE GAINS WE CAINTER SO YOU HAVE TO COUNTA KICK THE CAND ON THE ROAD FOR A FEW WEEKS BUT TAN WEEKS LATER YOU'LL BE IN AEBETTER SPOT THAN YOU R MIINVESTING LITIMIN YOUR CONDITIONING SOS YOU POINT OUT BEFORE AND I CAN ONLY ASSUME YOU REFERRING TO ME A HYPERTORRETRAINING IS IDIOT PROOF A MEANING THERE'S A LOT OF LEEWAY IN THE VARIABLES BUT NOT SO MUCH LEEWAY THAT PEOPLE CAN DO ANYTHING IT THA YES BOUNDED BY THESE GENERAL PRINCIPLES SO WITH YOUR PERMISSION I'M GOING TO DO A BRIEF OVER A VIEW OF MY NOTES BASED ON YOUR DESCRIPTION OF THE MODIFIABLE VARIABLES THAT WE'LL DIREX SOMEBODY TOWARDS HIPERTRIKEEPING YOUR MIND THIS BACKDROP OF EXERCISE CHOICE EXERCISE ORDER SELECTING APPROPRIATE VOLUME THAT SETS AND RAPS TRAINING FREQUENCY AND NEEDING SOME MATRIC OR WAY TO HAVE PROGRESSION Y EITHER BY ADDING MORE WADS OR BY MORE TENSION OR MORE MEDABALICSTRACTS AND SO ON IN TERMS OF EXERCISE CHOICE IT SOUNDS LIKE THE CHOICE OF EXERCISES IS NOT SUPERCRITICAL INTERMS OF SPECIPICITY BUT THAT THE IDEAL CIRCUMSTANCES THAT PEOPLE ARE TARGETING ALL THE MAGER AND FRANKLY SECONDARY AND MINOR MUSCLE GROUPS IF YOU CAN EVEN CALL THEM THAT ACROSS THEIR EXERCISE CHOICES THAT THEY'RE PICING EXERCISES THAT THEY CAN PERFORM SAFELY AND THAT THEY CAN GENERATE ENOUGH INTENSY SO THAT 'RE ETTING CLOSE TO FAILURE WITHOUT PLACING THEMSELVES INTO DANGER RI SO ON FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT MIGHT MEAN INCLUDING LARGE COMPOUND FREE WEIGHT EXERCISES LIKE SQUATS IN DEDLIFFS AND BENT OVER BARBAIL ROADS AS WELL AS ISOLATION EXERCISES AND FOR SOME PEOPLE THERE MIGHT BE A BY AS TOWARD MORE ISOLATION EXERCISES AND MACHINES BUT OF COURSE MACHINES DON'T NECESARILY MEANTHAT YOU CAN'T USE HEAVY LOADS IN FACT PLATE LOADED MACHINES LIKE HAMMERSTRANGTH MACHINES EALLOW FOR QUITE SUBSTANTIAL LOADS SO PICKING TWO OR THREE OR MORE MOVEMENTS PERMUSCLE GROUP CAN BE VALUABLE BUT THAT OVER ALL CONSISTENCY IS GOING TO OUTSHINE VARIATION IN THE SENSE THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO HIT MUSCLES WITH A DIFFERENT EXERCISE EVERY WORK OUT COMING BACK TO THE SAME THINGS HAS A BENEFIT AND WE HEARD ABOUT THIS IN OUR DISCUSSION ROUND STRENGTH AND POWERS WELL KIN TERMS OF ORDER OF EXERCISES THERE TOO IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY ONE COULD DO THE LARGE COMPOUND EXERCISE FOR LET'S SAY A QUADRUCEPS AND HAMSTRINGS INGLUDES FIRST LIKE A A SQUAT OR A FRONT SQUAT WERE COULD DED LIFT FOR THAT MATTER BUT THEN IF ONE DEAD LIFTED IN PRIMARILY HIT THE GLUES IND HAMSTRINGS THAN YOU MIGHT WANT TO TARGET THE QUADRCEPS MORE DIRECTLY WITH LIKE EXTENSIONS OR IF ONE SQUATTED AND WAS LOADING THAT SQUABAR CARRING THE SQUAP BARRIN AWAY THAT WAS PREDOMINANTLY QUADRUSET AND LES SO GLUTE AND HAMPSTERING THEN LEG CURLS WOILD BE A GOOD CHOICE ET CETERA OK IN TRAIN YOUR CATS FOLKS VERY IMPORTANT UNLESS YOU'RE GENETIC FREAK OF COURSE YOUACU GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO SAY UNLESSYOU'RE GENETIC FREEK OR YOU TOS HAVE A GENET PREDISPOSITION OR YOU'VE DONE SPORTS AND AND YOU HVE A GENET PREDISPOSITION THAT GIVES YOU YOU KNOW VERY LARGE CAPS DON'T REQUIRE ANY TRAINING IT ALL I I KNOW PEOPLE LIKE THIS THERE THERE'S SOMEWHAT RARE BUT THEY'RE OUT THERE AND THOSE FOLKS SOMETIMES WANT TO STAY AWAY FROM OR MINIMIZE THEIR TRAINING YOU TOLD ME THAT EVEN IF YOU HAVE A MUSCLE GROUP THAT'S A HYPER RESPONDER IN TERMS OF HYPOERTROPHY GETTING AT LEAST ONE OR TWO GOOD HARD SETS PER WEEK IS GOOD BECAUSE YOU WANT TO KEEP FUNCTIONALITY IN THAT NARO MUSCULAR SYSTEM LOF IT OK IN TERMS OF VOLUME AGAIN WE HAVE LARGE ROUN A VARIATION IS WHAT I'M HEARING THAT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SETS PER WEEK IS A STRONG DRIVING FORCE OF PROGRAMM DESIGN AND SELECTION THAT IDEALLY YOUR PERFORMING TEN TO TWENTY AND PROBABLY MORE LIKE FIFTEEN TO TWENTY SET PER WEEK AND THAT TO BE DIVIDED UP ACROSS MULTIPLE WORKOUTS WE'RE DONE IN ONE WORK OUT BUT THAT'S TEN TO TWENTY SETS PER WEEK PER MUSCLE GROUP NOT REALLY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT INDIRECT ACTIVATION SO THAT WOULD BE TEN TO TWENTY SETS FOR BYSEPTS YOUR BACK WORK IS CON YOUR BICEPS SO LITTLE BIT MAYBE A BIT MORE DEPENDING ON THE EXERCISE SELECTION BUT IT'S REALLY TEN TO TWENTY AND GIVEN THAT HYPERTROPHE CAN STILL OCCUR IN MAYBE N OCCURS BETTER WITH MORE VOLUME YE THEN DON'T INCLUDE THE INDIRECT WORK UNLESS SOMETHING ABOUT THE ARCHITECTURE OF YOUR BODY IN THE INABILITY TO ENGAGE CERTAIN MUSCLE GROUPS LIKE MAKES THE A PULL UP REALLY AN ARM EXERCISE FOR YOU YOU HAVE THAT RIGHT THE WAY THAT I WOULD MAYBE TO FIND IT IS TYPICALY WITH MOVEMENTS WEEK CONSIDER TO BE THER'RE TO BE PRIMARY MOVERS SECONDARY MOVERS AND THEN TERTIARY THAT IT'S RIGHT IF IT IS A PRIMARY SECONDARY I'M PROBALY COUNTING IF IT'S TERTUARY OR LESS I'M PROBALY NOT COUNTING GOT IT SO  GOING BACK TOUR EXAMPLE OF A PULL UP SO AN EXAMPLE OF PLUP I PROBABLY WOULDN'T COUNT THE BICEPS AND PULL UP YT WOULD PROBABLY COUNT THE BI SUPSTERING A CANUP WOULD YOU COUNT THE REAR DELTOID IN A PULL UP A PROBABLY NOT MAYMAYBE LI E IT IS DEPENDS PROBALY NOT THO  TRAIN THE REAR DELTS ALSO THAT THAT'S ONLY HONESTLY THE REASON I ANSWER THAT IS BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE DON'T DO ANYTHING F THE REAL DAR DOUTS ANYWAYS BUT THEY SHOULD RIGHT ABSOLUTELY THAT'S WHY DON ON ACCOUNT I WANTE YOU TO GOD NYOUR WAY TO MAKE SURE YOU TO SOMETHING SPECIFICALLY FOR THE RAL RERDEUBTS FOR ASTHETICS AND FOR FUNCTIONEL O HAVE FOR HEALTH AND AND BALANCE ACROSS THE SHOULDERS TOTALLY NECK SHOULDER ALL OF IT I'M SO HAPPY TO HERE YOU SAY THIS I'M A HUGE FAN OF PEOPLE DOING REAR DELTOY T WORK FOR ALL THE REASONS YOU DESTRIBE END NECK WORK FOR THAT MATTER I HPEOPLE FORGET THAT THE NECK IS THE UPPER PART OF YOUR SPINE YEAND FOR POSTERAL REASONS AND FOR STABLIZATION AN SAFETY REASONS IT'S REALLY CRITICAL BUT I THINK MOST PEOPLE AREN'T FAMILIAR WITH HOW BEST TO TRAIN THE REARDELTOIDS AND NECK AND I KNOW A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF GETTING A BIG NECK WHICH FOR REASONS THAT ARE STILL ON CLEAR TO ME IS REFERRED TO AS NO NECK BUT LET'S LEAVE OUT THAT NO NECK COMMENT FOR THE MOMENT WAT ER SOME GOOD EXERCISES FOR TARGETING THE REAR DEALTOYDS AND NECK SAFELY THAT PEOPLE CAN PERFORM FOR DEBLIZATION AND FOR HYPERTROPHY I WOULD RECOMMEND PEOPLE CHECK OUT ERIC CRESSY HE'S A A WONDERFUL A STRENGTHENIS IONIN COACH EACTHE IS I THINK THE DIRECTOR OF PITCHING FOR THE NEW YORK YANKEES NOW IS THAT SPELL SEE AR E ECESS I YE SEE ARE E ESCESS E WHY I BELIEVE AND HE'S GOT A FACILITY IN AI BELIEVE BOSTON AS WELL AS IN A FLORIDA SO HE'S VERY VERY INVOLVED IN PITCHING AS WELL AS HOCKY AN N THINGS LIKE THAT SO I'M HE HAS SO MANY FREE VIDIOS AND RESOURCES ON A ON SO MUCH OF THE SHOULDER GIRL MOSTLY BECAUSE HE HE'S DEALT WITH OVERHEAD AND THROWING OUT THES AND SO THE PRECISION REQUIRED THEIR INSTRUMENT O SO YOU WANT TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU START PLAYING IN THIS AREA BECAUSE THE WRONG POSITIONING OF YOUR SCAPULA CAN CAUSE A WHOLE MONTH OF PROBLEMS IN YOUR NECK AND LOW BACK AND SO HE WOULD BE A GREAT RESOURCE TO GO TAKE ALOK OF THAT I'M DEPAY ON HOW YOU'RE YOURE SCAPULAS ARE GLIDING AND SLIDING AND THAT THE WAY THAT YOU WANT YOUR ROTATE O COPS FIRING I'M YOU WRON BOYDS THERES IT'S LEK VERY COMPLICATED VERY QUICKLY SO YOU WANT ON MORE GO THERE AS A VERY VERY QUICK COUPLE OF ANSWERS OM ONE OF MY FAVOURITE EXERCISES IS IS LYING ON A BENCH OR A PUTTING SOME BUT NENTIAND THEN JIS DOING A REVERSE FLY MASICALLY I'M THE REASON I LIKE STABLIZING THE REST THE BODY SO YOU CAN MAKE SURE YOU CAN FOLCUS ON JUST USING THOSE REARDOLITHIS AND PUTTING A YOUR SCAPULUS IN THE RIGHT POSITION NOW THE'S THERE'S A SPECIFIC AT A CEWING THAT YOU WANT THE SCAP YOU THT MOVE DOWN AND BACK FOR AGAIN CHECK OUT ARIC OR ANY A NUMBER OF FOLKS IN THAT AREA TO DO I BUT THAT THAT'S A VERY SIMPLE WAY  THE REVERSE FLIH TO GET THERE GREAT AND THEN TERMS OF NEC EXERCISES OIS TOLD TO AVOID BRIDGES BECAUSE THEY CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE DISKS  WU OGERLY NEVER DO ER I THE REST OF MY LIFE SO 'M I SOME METRICS ER ARE A GREAT EXERCISE FOR THAT BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT WE AWE ARE ASKING MUSCLE GROUPS TO DO AND THE NECK YOU MOSTLY WANTED TO BE ABLE TO DO A CERTAIN TYPE OF ROTATION A LITTLE BIT OF FLECTS IN EXTENSION I ANDSOME SOME OTHER MOMENTS BUT IN GENERAL IT SHOULD BE BEING STABLE I'M SEE ANT A WALK THROUGH THESE JOINTS BUT ASKING COUNT WHAT THEY DO R THEY MOVING JOINTERE THEY STABILITY JOIND IN THIS CASE YOU WNT IT THETHERE SO I SOME ECTRICS ARE GOING TO PUT YOU IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION THERE'S SOME ACTUALLY PRETTY COOL DEVICES THAT YOU CAN WEAR AND YOU CAN PUT HIM ON YOUR HEAD NU CAN DO ALL KINDS OF MOVEMENT I AN GET SOME GREAT TRAING THERE THOSE ARE GREAT STARTS BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY THAT JUST BASIC I SOMMECTRICS ARE GREATWER TO GO ABOUT IT IM NECKBRIGES WOULD NOT BEYOND THAT LIST FOR MA NHO NECK BRIDGES FOLKS IN TERMS OF SATS IN REPETITIONS WE BRIEFLY TOUCH ON IS BUT ANYWHERE FROM I BELIEVE SIX REPETITIONS ALL THE WAY UP TO THIRTY RE PETITIONS BUT PROBABLY MORE IN THE EIGHT TO FIFTEEN REPETITION RANGE FOR HYPERTROPHY MOST O THE TIME YET AND I'LL JUST THROW IN THERE CAUSE I  LOVE THIS IDEA THAT IF YOU WANT TO GET A RELATIVELY BALANCED ADAPTATION  RELATED TO STRENGTH AND HYPERCTOVY THAT SEVEN TO NINE RANGE THE A THET NO MANS A OR THEN NO WOMAN'S A LAND OF A A TRAINING REPETITIONS ILWAYS JOKING CLASS LIKE COKE WE WE GO THE WHOLE THING RIGHT YOU LIKE ONE TO FIVE STRENGTH EIGHT TO TWELVE NOW I PERTRATING LIK GRAY NN LIKE COCASE SO SIX TO NINE MEANS NOTHIN ILL HAPPEN AT ALL T GI IT IS LIKE RIDING DOWN LIK RI GOOD WAY TO FOR EVERYBODY TO REMEMBER THAT THER OUR ADAPTATIONS TRIGGERED IN THE SIXTY NINE REPRANGE AND IT'S A BALANCE OF STRENGTH AND IGIT YOU' IS IT  THROWN OUT OF ANY GIM THAT I'M PART OF PINGACITY DO THAT A SO BUT THE IMPORTANT POINT IS TO GET CLOSE TO FAILURE AND OCCASIONALLY FAILURE MAYBE OCCASIONALLY THROWIN A FORCED REPETITION OR A REST CAUSE RE REST THAN TO A FEW MORE SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT THOSE INTENSITY INCREASING MANEUVERS WILL A REQUIRE LO BIT MORE ATTENTION TO RECOVERY EITHER TIME OR OR ATTENTION IN SOME OTHER WAY AND HERE'S A LITTLE BIT O CARE IT A'LL THROWGH UT PEOPLE BECAUSE PEOPLE GENERALLY DON'T LIKE TO BE TOLD TO NOT GO TO FAILURE THAT OFTEN I SO SO THERE'S A HANDFUL LIKE HALF THE FOLKS ARE LIKE SWEET HOW HAVE TO TRAIN THAT HARDIN GET THERE AND TOSE FOLKS AS LIKE WI YES BUT ALSO SAID YOU JUST CAN'T LIKE DO A HALF WORK OUT YOU HAVE TO GET PRETTY DOWN CLOTES TO FAILURE AND MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALLY KNOW FAILYUE MEANS SO FOR THAT GROUP IT'S ACTUALLY IT' STILL PROBABLY HARDER THAN YOU THINK YOU OUGHT A TRAIN THE OTHER GROUP THOUGH THE LIKE ONCE TO COMPLETELY BLOW THEMSELVES OUT EVERY SINGLE TIME DRAGGING THEM BACK IT IS MORE THE KEY NOW FOR THOSE FOLKS HERE'S WHAT I CAN SAY IF YOU MAKE SURE THAT YOURE HIDDEN STRESSERS INVISIBLE STRESSERS OUR  COMPLETELY TAKEN CARE OF YOU CAN GO TO FAILURE ALL LOT MORE OFT AND SO YOU NEED TO DIAL THOSE THINGS IN AND THET NI UCAN GO HAMMER YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU'LL RECOVER SO MUCH QUICKER AND WE SEE THIS VERY COMMONLY I'M IN ALL OUR PROGRAMS WITH WITH OUR ATHLETS AND AND ARE NON ATHLETS THAT WHEN WE GET THE REST OF THE HIDDEN INSTR ANDVISIBLE STRUSSERS TAKEN CARE OF THEIR TRAINING VOLUME GOES UP SO MUCH BECAUSE THE'LL JUST ART COMING BACK AND TAT AS LIKE ALL MY GOT I'M NOT SORELY MORE OH MY GOT I'M NOT NEARLY A SORM I MAY YOU DID THIS EXACT WORK OUT AN COUNTLESS TIMES BEFORE AND NOW I'M DOING IT AND I'M NOT SORE AT ALLI WHAT THEY HLL LIKE WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING DIFFEREN WITH THE PROGRAMMING OR REALLY THE NETRICION BUT WE GOT THE REST OF THAT ALESTATIC LOAD UNDER CONTROL AND BONE THINGS TAKE OFF SLOLIKE DRIVERS MANY PEOPLE SEEM TO BE RIDING THE BREAK AND SOME MONY PEOPLE SEEM OO HEAVY ON THE ACCELERATOR YET S IKE YOU HUN THE WAYS WE DESCRIBE IT IS LIKE YOU WANT TO GO FASTER PEOPLE'S INCLINATION STEP ONE IS TO GET THE GAS OUR OUR STEP NUMBER ONE IS MAKING SURE YOUR LEFT FOOTS NOT ON THE BREAK YOU'LL GO FASTER WITH LESS RESISTANCE WHICH MEANS YOU'LACTUALLY WEARY DOWN THE SYSTEM A LOT SLOWER BY JUST TAKING YOUR FOOT OFF THE BREAK FIRST IF YOU'RETHEN NOT GOING FAST ENOUGH NOW WE COAN PUSH EXCELERATOR BUT I'M NOT PUSHING THAT CELLER WAITER WHYE YOUR FOOTSTILL ON THE BREAK YOU CANAT GO A LIOK A FASTER BUT NOT AS FAST AS YOU SHOULD BE GOING WITHOUT MUCH WORK AND YOU CAN START WEARING DOWN BREAK PEDLES AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO LIKE THAT ANALOGY SO HIDDING THAT TEN TO TWENTY SATS PR WEEK REPETITION RANGE IS PRETTY BROAD PROVIDE YOU GET CLOSE TO FAILURE HIT FAILURE EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE COULD BE THE FINAL SET OF CH EXERCISE OR MAYBE DO ONE WORK OUT WEREYU HIT FAILURE ON EVERYTHING BUT THIN YOU DON'T DO IT FOR MANY MORE GAN THAT THERE SOMESTHING THERE'S A LOT OF PLAY IN THE SYSTEM HERE REST RANGES ANYWHERE FROM THIRTY SECONDS ALL THE WAY UP TO THREE OR FOUR MINUTES DEPENDING ON HOW HEAVIER TRAINING AND HOW CLOSE TO FAILURE OR TO FAILURE MAYBE EN QUOTING BEYOND FAILURE IF THERE IS SUCH A THING YOUR TRAINING A THROWING IN NEGATIVES AND THINGS LIKE THAT WE DIDN'T GET INTO REALLY HIGH INTENSITY TECHNIQUES BUT PEOPLE AGAIN VARY IN EXTENT TO WHICH THE  PUSHING THE SYSTEM BUT THERE DOES SEEM TO BE SOME VALUE TO MIXING UP THE REST BETWEEN SET RANGES ACROSS EXERCISES AND ACROSS WORK OUTS BUT YOU COULD COMBINE THEM ALL IN THE SAME WORK OUT IS WHAT I HEARD YET AND THEN IN TERMS OF PROGRESSION IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THE GOAL WEN HYPRTOVY TRAINING IS NOT NECESSARILY TO ADD MORE WEIGHT TO THE BAR ALTHOUGH THAT'S ONE WAY ONE COULD DO IT BUT THAT THE PROGRESSION ACTUALLY CAN ARRIVE THROUGH THIS REALLY EXTENSIVE KIT OF CHANGING THE SPEED OF MOVEMENT CHANGING A THE NUMBER OF SATS ADDING SOME VOLUME A MAYBE CHANGING THE SPLIT SO THAT YOU GO FROM A THREE DAY WEEK FULL BODY WORK OUT TO MORE OF A UMBODY PARTS ONE OR TWO BODY PARTS PER DAY EVERY OTHER DAY OR TWO ON ENE OFF IT ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT VARIATIONS ITTER OUT THERE SOUNDS LIKE ALL OF THESE CAN AN WILL WORK PROVIDED THAT PEOPLE ARE OBEYING THE GENERAL PRINCSIPLES OF THIS A HYPERTREPE ADAPTATION INDUCING PROTOCAL THAT YOU DESCRIBED AND THAT THEY ARE MEETING THE NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT VARIABLES AS WELL SUCH AS SLEEP YE NUTRITION AND MANAGING THE STRESTS IN THE REST OF THEIR LIFE DO I HAVE THAT CORRECTLY YET THAT'S REALLY REALLY GOOD ONE MORE THING I LIKE TO ADD IS THIS IS A SITUATION FOR I PERCHAPY IN WHICH THERE ARE SOME EXERCISES THAT ACTUILY DON'T THINK OUR GOOD IDEAS SO ON A MAKES YURE WEEK WE CINCLUDE THOSE IN THE CONVERSATION THAT'S NOT A SERLY CASE FOR STRENGTH  YOU CAN REALLY DO I NOTERONO AND THAT IS SPECIFICALLY PLIN METRICS ALTHOUGH IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT THA THERE'S A A RECENT REVIEW PAPER COM NOT SHOWING THAT THIK PLIMETRICS ARE EFFECTIVE AS WELL FOR I FIRTI LIKE ONE CAN DO ALMOST ANYTHING AS LONG AS IT FALLS WITHIN THIS PARAMETER SA THE CONCEPTS ARE FEW IN THE METHODS ARE MANY AND THE METHODS FOR A PERCHIPY ARE MANY MANY IN GENERAL THOUGH PLIMMETRICS ARE NOT MY FIRST SECOND OR EVEN LIKE HUNDREDTH CHOICE A FOR HYPERTIPY THEY IF THERE ARE PART OF A TOTAL TRAING PROGRAME AND YOU GETS OM A HIPERTRY  RESULT COOL YOU'R LUCKY NOT THE FIRST PLACE ON GOONE THE OTHER MAJOR CATEGORY ARE WEIGHT LIFTING VARIATION SO THAT WHEN I'M SAYING WAY LIFTING A ME SPECIFICALLY ALENPIC WAY LIFTING HAS 'N SNATCHED CLEAN IN DER AND THEIR VARIATIONS THOSE ARE JUS NOT A GOOD EXERCISE CHOICE IS NT THAT THEY DON'T WORK IN JUST THE RISK THE BENEFIT RATIO STARTS TO FALL PRETTY FAST AND A IN THE NEGATIVE FAVOR AND SOS IS NOT WORTH DOING SETS OF TEN OF A SNATCH UNLESS YOURE IN A SPORT WHERE THAT'S LIKE THE COMPETITION WHATEVER BUT IF THE GOLD IS SIMPLY IPERTROPHY I'M TOOSDIFFERENT EXERCISES THEN NOT GREAT I REALIZE THAT WE ARE GOING TO DO ENTIRE EPISODES RELATED TO NUTRITION SOMPLIMETATION RECOVERY ET CETERA BUT I LIKE TO JUST TOUCH ON TWO OR THREE SPECIFIC TOPICS IN QUESTIONS THAT COME UP A LOT AROUND THE QUESTION OF HYPERTROPHY SPECIFICALLY AND THAT PROBABLY ALSO RELATE TO STRAINE TRAINING IN TRAINING FOR SPEED I'M GOIN TO ASK THESE IN ON NOT RAPID FIRE TRET I'LL GIVE YOU SHORTER ANSWERS OOPER THAT SO I WILL ASK THESE QUESTIONS NOW BUT WITH THE COFYAHT THAT WE WILL GET INTO THESE TOPICS IN MUCH MORE DEPTH E VERY SOON THE FIRST QUESTION IS ABOUT THE USE OF COLD SHOWERS AND ICE BATHS AND COLD WATER EXPOSURE WHICH I KNOW MANY PEOPLE USE FOR RESILIENTS TRAINING TO INCREASE THER DOPAMEAN WHICH IT DOES AND FOR RECOVERY BUT THERE'S ALSO THIS ISSUE OF WHEN ONE SHOULD USE COLD THAT IS DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE RELATIVE TO HYPERTROPHY TRAINING SPECIFICALLYAND THAT'S BECAUSE I'VE HEARD THAT IF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE IS DONE TOO SOON AFTER I HAVE PERTOPHY ADAPTATION INDUCING WORK OUT YET AND ALL THE SORTS OF THINGS WE CAN TALKING ABOUT THAT THE HYPERTROPHY RESPONSE CAN BE BLUNTED REDUCED OR ELIMINATED IS THAT TRUE AND IF SO WHEN COULD PEOPLE DO DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE WHILE STILL ALSO INCLUDING HYPERTORY TRAINING IN THEIR PROGRAM AND STILL GET HYPERTROPHY GREAT SO YOU KNOW I'M A LOVER OF THE COLD I I STILL HAVE A DEEP FREEZER IN MY HOUSE THAT IS FILLED WITH WATER AT ALL TIMES THAT I'S PLUGGED IN AND AND IS A FROZEN CHAMBER I STILL DO THE OLD SCHOOL STA OF IT PLEASE DON PLUGET BEFORE YOU GET IN IT OH YES ABSOLUTELY AND THEN DON'T DO IT BY YOURSELV SO THAT THE LID CLOSE ON TOPYOU AND TH WE DON'T SEE YOU SORT OF EVER AGAIN O O THE HON SO LOEFEIT'S TIME FOR ME NOT GREAVEET WHEN THESE NEW FANCY OI'VE AMUSING TIS FOR SO MANY YEARS SO I LOVE IT I OBVOUSLY I'VE BEN INVOLVED WITH EXPT AND AN GABBYIN LAIRD AND BRIN MC KENSIY IN THESE FOLKS SO I'VE BEN DOING THO SUFFER A LONG TIME OF BUT I DON'T N KNOW HOW MANY HUNDREDS OF FOLKS IN THE ICE AND THEN OF WATERIES SO THERE ARE A LOT OF BENEFITS AND WE COULD TALK ABOUT THOSE LATER HOWEVER THAT THAT BEING SAID IT IS VERY VERY TRUE YOU DO NOT WANT TO GET IN THE ICE POSTIF HYPERTRY TRAINING YOU WOULDN'T WONT DO THAT IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE WORK OUT YOU PROBABLY DON'T WONT TO BEFORE THE WORK OUT YOU PROBABLY DON'TLY WANT TO DO AT THAT SAME DAY IT IS IS NOT WORTH IT IT WILL BLUNTH I PERTRFY IN SPECIFICALLY WE'VE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT WHAT'S DRIVING MUSCLE GROWTH IS THAT SIGNALLING CASCADE THROUGH THAT GENE EXPRESSION TO THAT MUSCLE PROACHING SYNTHESIS COLD EXPOSURE BLOCKS THAT SIGNAL REMEMBER ADAPTATION COMES FROM STRESS YOU'VE PUT ON A STRESS RAND NOW YOU'VE BLOCKD THAT STRESS YOU'VE LITERALLY BLOCKED THE SIGNAL THAT TELLS YOUR BODY COME BACK AND GROW ARTERCISE SO NOT A GOOD IDEA TO DO IT IF YOU'RE TRAINING FOR SOME OTHER PURPOSES IT MAY BE STRENGTH MAYBE THERE'S AN ARGUMENT THERE ALTHOUGH MAYBE NOT I'M FOR SPEEDING POWER MAYBE GET AWAY THE ENDURANCE MAY BE A SEPARATE CONVERSATION IF YOU'RE IN SEASON I HAVE NO PROBMUSING IT IMMEDIATELY AFTER A GANE THE GOAL IS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT EVEN IF WE DID A HYPERTRICY TYPEOR TRAINING PROGRAM WE'RE NOT DOING IT TRT AT O MA DRY TO MAXIMAS GROWTH AND TOW PARTICULAR CASE OUR PRIORITY FOR A RECOVERY IS HIGHER THAN OUR PRIORITY FROM MUSOL GROWTH SO WE CHOOSE OPPLIMIZATION IN THAT CATEGORY YOU CAN ONLY MAKE THOSE CHOICES THOUGH WHEN YOU TRULY UNDERSTAND WHAT IS THE GOAL FOR THE DAY THE WEEK THE MONTH THE PHASE OF TRAINING AND REALLY WHAT PART OF THE YEAR YEARIN WE HAVE THAT ALL PLOTTED OUT FOR FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WE WORK WITH SO I KNOW WHEN WE WANT TO CHOOSE ONE OVER THE OTHER IS NOT A THIS IS THE CHOICE YOU ALWAYS MAKE SUCH ANATION THAT'S THITS NOT HOW WE OPERATE MANY MORE PRECISION IN THOUGH SO THAT BEING SAID WE'RE GENTLLY NOT GOING TO DO IT IF WE WANT TO DO A LOT OF ICING DURING A PHASE IN WHICH WE'RE I USING A LOT OF HYPRTROPHY WE'RE GO I DO A COUPLE OF THINGS BOT ON WE MAY UST NOT USE IT SO THERE ARE PHASES IN OUR TRAINING OR I DON'T WANT A MAXIMA'S RECOVERY I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU ANY TRICKS HERE I'M NOT GOING TO DO ICE OR ANY THE OTHER METHODS WERE NOT TALK ABOUT WHY BECAUSE THE WHOLE POINT IS TO CAUSE OVERLOOKED THAS'S WHAT'S GOING TO BE TO STIMULI TO CAUSE ADAPTATION IF ALL I'M DOING HIS BLOCKING THAT STUFF ATTENUATING IT SMASHING A BACK DOWN I'M UNDERCUTTING MYSELF I'M CHOOSING TO FILL A LITTLE BUT BETTER TO HAVE A LITTLE BUT BETTER PERFORMANCE RIGHT NOW KNOWING THAT'S GOING TO COMPROMISE THE RESULT I'M GOING TO GET SIX EIGHT AND TWELVE WEEKS FROR NOW I SO I'M NOT GOING TO CHOOSE IT ALL IN REALLITY OF IT IS IF I REALLY AM TRYING TO MAXIMAS HYPERTROPHY I'M PROBABLY NOT DOING ANY ICE WORK FROM THAT WHOLE PHASE MAYBE LIKE MY OFF DAY I KNOW THAT SIMILAR TO A SET UP YOU HAVE LIKE ONE DAY A WEEK WHEN I'M NOT TRAINING WE'LL JUMP IN SOME ICE MAYBE EVEN TO SOME HOT COL CONTRAST I'M I LOVE THE EXPETPROTA CALLITSS YOU KNOW WEVE PROBLY TALKED ABOUT IT BEFORE IT'S A GREAT SET UP I'M OR OR DIES NOT DO IT AT ALL I IT DOES NOT SOMETHING WE NEED WHEN WE DO MOVE INTO ANOTHER PHASE OF TRAINING WE'E WERE TRYING TO MAXIMIS ADAPTATION OR MAXIMSE THE RESULT AND AND GET THE BENEFIT OF THAT TRAINING NOW ORGIN TO HEDGE MORE TOWARDH RECOVERY AND WE'RE TO BRING IN SOME OF THESE STRATEGIES IN TECHNIQUES ANDM NOT WORRY ABOUT CAUSING THE MOST STIMULI THERE CAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO ATTENUARE WE WERE TRYING TO ACTUAL LIES THE WORK WE DID SIX A TAND TWELVE WEEKS BEFORE WHAT ABOUT COLD SHOWERS DO THOSE HAVE THE SAME HYPERTRAPHY BLUNTING EFFECT AND GENERAL NO AND GENERAL YOU CAN DO COLD SHOWERS THAT'S NOCCO BE A PROBEM YOU'RE NOT CAN BE THERE VERY LONG AND YOU'RE NOT CAN TO GET NEARLY AS COLD I'M AS YOU WELL SUBMERGED IN THIRTY DEGREE ICE WATER FOOT LIKE THAT THE WY THAT WE DO IT NONE THE LESS SO II HAVE NO PROBEM STANDING IN THE SHOWER FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES I'M USING IT FOR OTHER REASONS IF IF YOU WANT TO THAT SNOISSOE I'D LIKE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT NUTRICION AND SUPPLEMENTATION AS IT RELATES TO HYPERTROPHY DOCTORELY NORTON WHO'S BEEN A GAST ON HE HEBREW IN LADPODCASTAN WE BOTH NO THROUGHOUT A NUMBER RANGE RELATED TO PROTE INTAKE ON THE BACKTROP OF HOW MUCH PROTING SYNTESIS CAN OCCUR BY MEAL ACROSS THE DAY ET CETERA OT OF LOT OF RESEARCH DONE THERE AN SOME IMPORTANT WORK BY HIM IN PARTICULAR AND THE THE VALUE THAT HE THREW OUT WAS ONE POINT SIX GRAHAMS PER KILEGRAM OF BODYWEIGHT BEING THE LOWER AND OF THE RANGE UP TO I BELIEVE IS IT WAS AS HIGH AS TWO POINT FOR MAYBEVEN AS HIGH AS TWO POINT SEVEN YET GRAHAM'S OF PROTINE PER KILEGRAM OF BODYWEIGHT PER DAY THAT'S A PRETTY BROAD RANGE BUT IT'S ON THE HIGHER END OF WHAT I THINK MOST PEOPLE THINK OF IN TERMS OF PROTINE AND TAKE AND THEN AGAIN SOME PEOPLE MIGHT ALREADY BE RIGHT THERE OR MAY BE EVEN ABOVE THAT VALUE OF COURSE THIS ALL DEPENDS ON WHETHER NOT PEOPLE ARE OMINIVORE VIGAN I MEET BASE ET CETERA WE WON'T EVEN GO THERE BUT ASSUMING PEOPLE ARE GETTING ENOUGH PROTINE PER DAY SO SOMEWHERE IN THAT RANGE AND THEY ARE SPREADING OUT THAT PROTINE AND TAKE TO ACCOMMODATE THE FACT THAT THE BODY CAN ONLY ASSIMILATE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PROTINE IN ANY GIVEN SITTING WHAT DO YOU LIKE TO SEE PEOPLE IN JEST AT SOME POINT POST HYPROTROPHY INDUCING WORK OUT IN ORDER TO GET THE PROTINE SYNTHESIS ADVANTAGE IF YOU WILL YE THAT IS STIMULATED BY THAT WORK OUT EARLIER YOU MENTION THE U NON THE POST TRAINING FEEDING WINDOW N YOU KNOW IN THE NINE ESE AND PROBABLY EARLIER PEOPERTIME AT O YOU KNOW WITHIN THE FIRST NINETY MINUTES YOU HAVE TO GET THER IS AMONRAA YO WAS IT THE EVEY MINUTES OF EXCUSE ME A CERTAIN NUMBER OF GRAMS OF CARBOHYDRADE AND PROTINE ET CETERA I THINK NOW THE UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THAT WINDOW AS MUCH BROADER AM AND HOW BROAD AND ET CETERAAS IS STILL A MATTER OF DEBATE BUT WHEN SOMEBODY IS TRAINING SPECIFICALLY FOR PER HYPERTROPHY ASSUMING THEY ARE GETTING ENOUGH PROINE FROM QUALITY SOURCES IN THEIR OTHER MEALS AND ASSUMING THAT THERE OVERALL MACRONUTRINE AND TAKE AND COLORI CAN TAKE IS HIGH ENOUGH THAT IS THEY HAVE ENOUGH OF A CILORIC SURPLUS THAT THEY HAVE THE THE THE RAW MATERIALS FOR FOR HYPERTROPHY WHAT DO YOU LIKE TO SEE PEOPLE IN JST AT SOME POINT POST WORK OUT IN ORDER TO FACILITATE MUSCLE PROTINE SENTHESIS AND RECOVERY AND THIS COULD INCLUDE NUTRICION AND SUPPLEMENTATION OR IF YOU WANTO DIVIDE THOSE ANSWERS OUT AN PEELFREE DO SO YET LOOK AT GREAT SO TONAL WORK CAME OUT A DON LAYMONS LIGHELEX ACTLLY A LAND MENTOR AS WELL AS TO PHILIPS AT MY MASKER SO ATON WORK THERE AND WE CAN ANSWER A NUMBER OF THANGS HERE SO LANES NUMBERS THAT HE RECOMMENDED ALSO KNOTICE ABOUT A GRAHAM APPROCHING PERPOUND O BODYWAY IT'S A GREAT START NOW ONCE YOU SLIDE BELOWRHOUND RIGHT ONE GRAHM PERPOUND RIGHT AND EARLIERWERES ITS S A TO MAKE SURE WO CAUSE ONLER CHANGING UNITS HERE I WAS ONE POINT SIX GRAHAM'S PER KILEGRAM OF BODY WEIGHT ALL THE WY UP TO I THINK IT WAS TWO POINT FOR BOMABEAS HIGHS TWO POINT SEVEN YET IM GRAHAM'S APPROTING PER KILEGRAM O BODYWEIGHT SO TWO POINT TO IN THAT UNIT WOULD BE THE SAME THING SO TO PON YOGRAMS FOR KILEGRAMS THE SAME AS ONE GRAM PER POUND HT SO DOPANNYO WHICH ARE YOU'R LISTENING AT TO THIS AT MONE OF THOSE MAY BE EASIER THN THE OTHER FOR YOU IM IF YOU START GETTING BELOW THAT NUMBER NOW YOU DO START RUNNING INTO QUESTIONS OF PROTING QUALITY PROTINE TYPE AND PROTINE TIMING THIS IS OE OF THE REASONS WHY ACTUALLY FULLY AGREE WITH LANE IS JUST GET THAT NUMBER HIGHER THAN YOU THINK AND THEN ALL THOSE OTHER VARIABLES DON'T MATTER IF THAT NUMBER IS LOW THEN YOU NEED TO START PAYNG ATTENTION OF BUNCH OTHER STUFF YOU'VE HAT IT NOW COMPLEXITY OR TO YOUR PROGRAM THINGS U GOT TO PAY ATTENTION TO JUST STAY HIGH AN EED IT DOESN'T MATTER AND SO YOU MIST LEAVE A LOT OF THE THINGS OFF THE TABLE THAT SEEMS TO BE FAIRLY CLEAR AND IN THE WORK OF SOME OF HIS GENTLEMEN I JUST MENTIOND THAT AS LONG AS YOU GET TO THAT TOTAL NUMBER THE QUESTION ABOUT TIMING IN UNTYPES AND QUALITY IT SEEMS TO MATTER A LOT LESS IN FACT A A SUS RECENT WORK IN NAWN ANIMAL BASE PROTINS IT REALLY SHOW THAT TO BE FAIRLY CLEAR THAT THOSE ARE QUITE EFFECTIVE ASSUMING TOTAL PROTING AN TAKE IS HIGH ENOUGH IM THE AMOUNT OF LOOSYING ANOTHER AMUNAASSES IN THOSE ACTURAL PROTHINGS MATTER LESS IF THE TOTAL THRESHOLD IS SUPERHEIGHT SO JUST DO THAT IN YOUR FINE  NOW THE OTHER CAIOT WE HAVE TO SAY HERE IS TIMING OF MACKERNUTRIANS IS SEEMS TO BE SOMEWHAT IRRELEVANT FOR PROTINE BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE FOR CAR BAHYDRATES SO THAT TIMING DOES MATTER REPLENISH MEN OF MUSCL LIKE AGIN IS VERY SPECIFIC AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS RAUND A LOT IF YOU'RE DOING EITHER MAINTAINING TRAINING QUALITY OR YOU'R SLIDING INTO ENDURANCE IP WORK AND SO NEUTRAINT TIMING DOES MATTER WITH CAR BAHYDRATES MAY BE LESS SO E PROTIN AND CERTAINLY LESS SO WITH PROTINE IF THE TOTAL PROTING AGESTION IS HIGH ENOUGH SO UM IT DEPENDS ON WHAT WE'RE GOING AFTER IN TRMS OF A TRAININGLE I AND WHERE WE WANT TO GET WERE THALL THIY SINGS IN GENERAL THE WAYTHE WE LIKE TO THING ABOUT THIS IS IF YOU'RE DOING A STRENGTH TYPE OF WORK WERE YOU'RE TRULY TARGING THAT THEN A ONE TO ONE POST EXERCISE PROTINE TO CAR BAHYDRATE RATIO IS GENERALLY ORGANICLAFTER SO THIS WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY FIVE GRAMS OF PROTING AND THIRTY FIVE GRAMS OF CARBAHYDRATE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE POST IT CAN BE PRE OR MY FAVORIT IS ACTUALLY MID I OR POST BUT SOMEWHERE IN THAT RAIN ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE TRAING THE MORNING AND YOU HAVE NOT CONSUMED ANYTHING PRIOR TO YOUR WORK OUT THAT'S NOT UNSERLY EATING THE MILL OF THE WORK OUT THAT'S DRINKING A DOLLARS YE IT'S CAN TO BE I YETO SHE SOLEVING A S RODSHOT A IN THE GENERAL THOUGH I'M SURE IT'S HAPPENED YE SO WONE TO ONE IS THAT LIKE SORT OF STAND OR NUMBER HERE UM IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO SORT OF MORE OF A REALLY HARD CONDITIONING WORK OUT THAT NUMBER SLIDES UP TO SOMETHING LIKE THREE OR EVEN FOUR TO ONE WHICH WOULD BE CAR BAHYDRATE TO PROCHING RATIA SO IF WE WONT STAY AT THIRTY FIVE GRAMS OF PROTINE BORGNAGO MAY BE S HIGHEST LIKE A HUNDRED OR A HUNDRED AND FORTY GRAMS OF CAR BAHYDRATE GETN DEPENDING ON WHAT TYPE OF OF TRAINING RESORTED GOING IF YOU'REGONG TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF A COMBINATION THEN YOU LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF STRANGTH TE LITLEBIT CONDITIONING AN KIUND OF A STANDARD WORK OUT WHICH IS PROBLY SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ILL DO THEN YOU MAY BE WANT TO GO TO SOMETHNG LIKE TOOTAL ONE SO  THIRTY FIVE GRAMS AF PROTINE SIXTY SEVENTY GRAMS OF CAR BAHYDRATE AND THOSE ARE CONT JUST LIKE ROUGH NUMBERS THAT YOU CAN GO BY AND FOR PURE HYPER YOUL BE TRAININ WOULD YO LIKE O SEE PEOPLE IN JEST FROM CARBOR HYDRATE POST TRAIN FOR PURE HYPERCHPY TRAINING I WANT TO SEE THAT IS MANY THOSE NEUTRIANS AROUND THE TRAINING IS GENERALLY POSSIBLE NOW AGAIN I MAY CHANGE MY MIND WHEN OUR FASTINSTADY COMES OUT BUT AS IT STANDS NOW THERE IS NO ADVANTAGE TON NOT FUELING AROUND THE TRAINING AND THERE ARE SOME KNOWN AND SOME OTHER POTENTIAL ADVANTAGES TO FUELING SO I JUST SEE NO REASON TO NOT DO IT IM IN FACT MOST PEOPLE ARE GENERALLY GOING TO DO BETTER NOW THIS IS NOT SCIENCE THIS IS JUST MY COACHING EXPERIENCE AND THIS IS WITH OUR ATHLETES AND ALL OF OUR NON ATHLETS THAT WE'VE WORKED WITH AND DO WORK WITH THEY'RE JUST GOING TO BE BETTER SPREADING THOSE MEALS OUT GENTALLY THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND THE'RE GOING TO BE BETTER IF THEY HAVE THOSE NEUTRANS EITHER PREMID OR POST AND SO THEY'RE GOING TO GET EVEN FOR I PERCHFE THEY'REGOIG TO GET SOMETHING LIKE THAT ONE THREETOON RATIO OF CARVES AP PROACHIN PERSONAL PREFERENCE SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TEEP BEFORE THEY TRAIN SOME PEOPLE HAVE TO EAT BEFORE THEY TRAIN SOME PEOPLE CAN'T NOWPUT IN FOOD ING THEIR BELLY IMMEDITELY AFTER  WORK AROUND THAT YOU CAN YOU CAN PLAY BASTED ON PERSONAL REFERENCE BUT WE WANT THAT FEELING IN THERE  BECAUSE WE WANT A MAXIMISE THAT ETENSTOF GROWTH AND WE WANTED JUST GET A JUMPSTARN A RECOVERY BECAUSE WE'RE GONGTO BE TRAINING AGAIN PRETTY SOON SUPPLEMENTATION IS A HUGE TOPIC AND ONE THAT WE WILL GO INTO IN GREAT DEPTH IN E SOON TO OCUR EPISODE BUT IF YOU HAD TO PICK ONE SUPPLEMENT THAT CAN BENEFIT MOST EVERYBODY IF NOT EVERYBODY FOR THEIR TRAINING DIRECTED TOWARD STRANTE POWER AND IPERTROPHY WHAT WOULD THAT SUPPLEMENT BE AND HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE PEOPLE USE IT MEANING HOW MUCH SHOULD THEY TAKE AND WHEN SHOULD THEY TAKE IT YOR IF YOU DON'T COUNT PROTINE AND CARBOHYDRATES AS SUPPLEMENTS THEY TECHNICALLY ARE BUT WEL JUST WALK OUT RIGHT STORY I SHOULD BE MORE SPECIFIC I'M NOT REFERRING TO A NON FOOD FOR MAM PROTINE IND CARBIDE SO POWDERED PROTINE IN PART OF POWDERED CARBE HYDRATE ET CETERA AM IT TECHNICALLEAR SUPPLEMENTS THEIR HIGLY PROCESS BUT THEIRE A BUT I'M NOT IN CLING THAT I'M REFERRING TO A NON MACKROOM NEU TRIENT TYPE SUPPLEMENT YE DOS TESTOSTFRO ACCOUNT AM WELL IN THE CONTECTS IV TIS TAS  HUNDENIGITS A TO THE LOST ROM THE PEOPLE ARE MANUFACTURING THEMSELVES AH KAY THE CHEATING KIND AN DOGENOUS KIND NOW A ME CRETIN IS THEY ANSWER HERE WITHOUT QUESTION IT IS THE MOST WELL STUDIED IT IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND IT'S A  BENEFITS ARE ROBUST MEANING THEY ARE GOING TO CONFER POSITIVE ADAPTATIONS ACROSS MULTIPLE PHYSIOLOGICAL DOMAIN SO AND WE CAN CERTAINLY HAVE A VERY LONG CHAT ABOUT SOME OF THE INTERESTING THINGS THAT PEOPLE THI FACT WE JUST HAD ON DARING CANDOU  ON OUR BARBO SHROGED POT CASTAND HE WENT INTO EXTENSIVE DETAIL ABOUT ALL THE BENEFITS OF CREATING THE PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT INCLUDING THINGS LIKE BOM MENERAL DENSITY YOU ASKED ABOUT THER THERS ICREATING IS ACTUALLY FAIRLY EFECTIVE FOR THAT I'M LET ALONE THE THING A THE BENEFIT IN THINGS LIKE COGNATIVE FUNCTION DECISION MAKING MEMORY IM THE WORK THAT THERE'S BEING DONE THERE FOR NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS IM DEPRESSION A WHOLE HOST OF THINGS AT THAT CREATING IS BEING STUDIED FOR SOME OF THOSE STUDIES SHOW A LOT OF BENEFIT SOME OF IT SO MAY BE A LITTLE BITS OM NONE BUT THERES JIS A LOT OF THINGS CREATIN CAN DO I'MSO WHEN WE COUL TALK ABOUT MUSCLE RECOVERY OR MUSSLIVE PERCHBY 'M THAT'S WHERE THE BULK OF THE RESEARCH IS AND AND ND ITS VERY EFFECTIVE I'M IN TERMS OF TYPE CREATSIN ON A HIG RATE IS STILL THE BEST ONE AND ASK US BECAUSE HERE'S THE LARGEST EVIDENT SPACE I'M YOU CAN MAY BE MAKE SOME ARGUMENTS FOR SOME OTHER TYPES BUT YOU'RE REALLY GOIN TO REACH SATURATION PRETTY QUICKLY WITHIN A MATTER OF WEEKS AND THERE I'M AT A DOSE TO JIMANYWHERE BETWEEN LIKE THREE TO SIX GRAHAMS PER DAY I'M NOW FIVE GRAHAMS IS THE VERY STANDARD NUMBER WE GIVE REALITY IS I CHANGE THAT NUMBER BASED ON SIZE THAT'S JUST THE HONEST TRUTH IM IF YOU'RE TWO HUNDEREND TWENTY FIVE POUNDS YOU'RE NOT GON GET THE SAME DOSAGE OF CREATIONG AS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE POUND GIRL THATS JHUST THIS LIKE THIS IS NOT WONBERGAN TO DO SO WE MAY SLIDE THAT NUMBER DOWN A LITTE LET CLOSER TO THREE FOR T E THE SMALLER A GIRL BOY DOES MATTERS FEMALE PHYSICAL SIZE IF YOU'RE ONE OF OUR TWO HUNDRE AND SEVENTY FIVE OR THREE UNDRED AND THIRTY POUND OFFENCE OF RIGHT TACKLES AND THE AN A FELL YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE SAME DOSAGE EVERYBODY ALSO THAT NUMBERS GOINGTO GO UP TO SEVEN EIGHT NIN MAYBEEN TEN GRAMS TO DAY ITHERE SO THAT'S THIS KIND OF SCALE IN GENERAL IF YOU WONT E NESY ANSWER FIVE GRAHAMS IS THE STANDARD TAKE IN AFTER TRAINING THE TIMING DOESN'T MATTER TOTALLYOUR RELEVANT TAKE IN THE MORNING BREAKFAST TAKEN AT NIGHT TAKEEN IN TIME YOU ONT TAKE ET PREE WE TEND TO PUT I IN A LOT OF PEOPLES I'M WORK OUT IM SHAKES JUST TO MAKE SURE THE GET IN INOT THE DAY BUT THE TIMI IS A RELEVANT GREAT WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT VERY INFORMATIVE ANSWER AND I LOOK FOR I TO MUCH MORE DISCUSSION ABOUT NUTRITION AND

WELCOME TO THE HU BERMANLACONCAN  US SCIENCE  SCIENCE TAS TOE FRA   I MANDERHUBERMAN AND I'M A PROFESSOR NEROBIOLOGY AND OPTHOMOLOGY AT STAMFORD' SCHOOL OF MEDICINE MY GUEST TO DAY IS DAVID GOGGENS DAVID GOGGANS IS A RETIRED NAVY SEAL WHO SERVED IN IRAC AND AFGANISTINE HE'S ALSO A HIGHLY ACCOMPLISHED ULTRAMARITHON RUNNER FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DON'T KNOW ULTRAMARITHONS ARE DISTANCES LONGER THAN TWENTY SIX MILES AND IN DAVID'S CASE OFTEN LONGER THAN TWO HUNDRED MILES FOR HIS ACHIEVEMENTS AND ATHLETICS HE HAS BEEN INDUCTED INTO THE INTERNATIONAL SPORTS HULL OF FAME HE ALSO HELD A GINNIS WORLD RECORD FOR THE MOST PULLUPS COMPLETED IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS I SHOULD MENTION THAT NOT ONLY WAS DAVID A DECORATED NAVY SEAL BUT HE ALSO GRADUATED FROM ARMY RANGERS SCHOOL DAVID IS ALSO A HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL WRITER HAVING AUTHORED TWO BOOKS THE FIRST ENTITLED CAN'T HURT ME AND THE SECOND ENTITLED NEVER FINISHED BOTH OF WHICH ARE BEST SELLERS DAVID'S BOOKS COVER MANY TOPICS INCLUDING HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL DISCRIPTION OF WHAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS AND INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING CHILD AND YOUNG ADULTHOOD HIS HOME WAS ABUSIVE HIS SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT WAS ABUSIVE HE ESSENTIALLY HAD NO POSITIVE RESOURCES DIRECTED HIS WAY AND IN HIS TWENTIES HE FOUND HIMSELF TO BE OBIS THAT IS MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED POUNDS WORKING A JOB HE DESPISE FOR MINIMAL PAY AND IT WAS AT THAT POINT THAT DAVID BEGAN AN INNER DIALOGUE THAT FORCED HIM TO EXPLORE THE DEMON'S BORNE OUT OF HIS CHILDHOOD BUT ALSO THE POSITION THAT HE FOUND HIMSELF IN AS A YOUNG MAN AND THEN BEGAN THE JOURNEY TO NAVIGATE THAT DIALOGUE AND TRANSFORM HIMSELF INTO THE NAVY SEAL THE ULTRAMARITHON RUNNER THE BEST SELLING AUTHOR AND THE EXTRAORDINARILY POSITIVE AND INFLUENTIAL MAN THAT HE IS TO DAY A SEME OF YOU MAY KNOW DAVID HAS DONE VARIOUS PUBLIC LECTURES HE'S A FAMILIAR FACE ON LINE BECAUSE THEYRE SO MANY CLIPSE OF HIM ON YOU TUBE AND HE HAS DONE PODCAST BEFORE HOWEVER I'M CERTAIN THAT YOU'LL FIND TO DAY'S DISCUSSION TO BE VERY DIFFERENT THAN PREVIOUS PODCAST THAT DAVID HAS BEEN FUTURED ON THE REASON IS THAT OF COURSE WE GET INTO HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS WE TALK ABOUT THE MINE SET THAT ALLOWED HIM TO ACHIEVE THOSE THINGS BUT TO DAY DAVID REALLY LETS US UNDER THE HOOD HE LETS US INTO THE FORM OF INNER DIALOGUE THAT HE HAS TO EMBRACE INDEED THAT HE HAS TO GRAPPLE WITH ON A DAILY BASIS SOMETIMES MULTIBLE TIMES THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND NIGHT IN ORDER TO IMPOSE THE SORT OF SELF DISCIPLINE THAT HE IS SO WELL KNOWN FOR WE ALSO GET INTO SOME OF THE SCIENTIFIC MECHANISMS UNDERLYING WILL POWER AND WE TALK ABOUT DAVID'S CURRENT ENDEAVORS THAT INCLUDE FOR INSTANCE HIS OWN EXPLORATION OF SCIENCE AND MEDICINE FOR WHICH HE HAS BECOME AND INTENSE SCHOLAR AND PRACTITIONER I SHOULD MENTION THAT MULTIBLE TIMES THROUGHOUT TO DAY'S DISCUSSION YOU WILL HERE CURSE WORDS NOW DAVID AD I BOTH ACKNOWLEDGE THAT CURSING ISN'T FOR EVERYBODY AND THAT CURSING ITSELF IS DIFFERENT THAN PURSING AT SOMEBODY NONE THE LESS WE DO REALIZE THAT MANY PEOPLE PARENTS PERHAPS ESPESIALLY MIGHT NOT WANT TO HEAR PURSING IF YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR CURSON WELL THEN THIS PODCAST EPISODE IS PROBABLY NOT FOR YOU HOWEVER IF YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH PURSING OR IF YOU CAN TOLERATE IT I ASSURE YOU TO DAY'S DISCUSSION IS HIGHLY WORTH WHILE BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE EMPHISIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING N RESEART ROLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRAN EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COST TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SIGNS RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE THE THANKTHE SPONSERS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS MAWE NEWE VENISON MOWWE KNEWE VENISON IS THE MOST NEUTRIANT DENSE AND DELICIOUS RED MEAT AVAILABLE I'VE SPOKEN BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST AND THERE'S GENERAL CONCENSUS THAT MOST PEOPLE SHOULD STRIVE TO CONSUME APPROXIMATELY ONE GRAM OF PROTINE PER POUND OF BODYWEIGHT NOW WHEN ONE TRIVES TO DO THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAXIMISE THE QUALITY OF THAT PROTINE AN TAKE TO THE CALORY RATIO BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO CONSUME AN EXCESS OF CALORES WHEN TRYING TO GET THAT ONE GRAM OF PROTINE PER POUND OF BODYWEIGHT MOWE KNEWE VENISON HAS AN EXTREMELY HIGH QUALITY PROTINE TO CALORY RATIO SO IT MAKES GETTING THAT ONE GRAM OF PROTINE PROPOUND OF BODYWEIGHT EXTREMELY EASY IT'S ALSO DELICIOUS PERSONALLY I LIKE THE GROUND VENISON I L SO LIKE THE VENISON

AERO PRESS WAS DEVELOPED BY ALLAN ADLER WHO WAS AN ENGINEER AT STAMFORD AND I KNEW OF ALLAN BECAUSE HE HAD ALSO BUILT THE SO CALLED AROBE FRISBY WHICH I BELIEVE AT ONE TIME PERHAPS STILL NOW HELD THE GINIST BOOK OF WORLD'S RECORDS FOR FURTHEST THRONE OBJECT AND I USED TO SEE ALLAN BELIEVE OR NOT AT PARK SURROUND PALOWALTO TESTING OUT DIFFERENT AROBE FRISBY SO HE WAS SORT OF FAMOUS IN OUR COMMUNITY

MINUTES AFTER I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING ALTHOUGH NOT ALWAYS SOMETIMES IF I'M GOING TO EXERCISE I'LL DRINK COFFEE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING BUT I LOVE LOVE LOVE COFFEE AND WHAT I'VE PERSONALLY FOUND IS THAT BY USING THE AERO PRESS I CAN MAKE THE BEST POSSIBLE TASTE IN CUP OF COFFEE I DON'T KNOW WHAT EXACTLY IT IS IN THE AERO PRESS THAT ALLOWS THE SAME BEINGS TO BE PREPARED INTO A CUP OF COFFEE THA O TASTE THAT MUCH BETTER AS COMPARED TO ANY OTHER FORM OF BREWING THAT COFFEE EVEN THE TRADITIONAL FRENCH PRESS THE ARO PRESS IS EXTREMELY EASY TO USE AND IT'S EXTREMELY CALM PAT IN FACT I TAKE IT WITH

REFRESHED AND ENERGIZED YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE ATTUALLY HAS TO INCREASE BY ABOUT ONE TO THREE DEGREES ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE TEMPERATURE CHANGES OCCUR AT THE APPROPRIATE TIMES AT THE BEGINNING AND THROUGHOUT AND AT THE END OF YOUR NIGHT WHEN YOU WAKE UP IS TO CONTROL THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT AND THAT'S WHAT EIGHT SLEEP ALLOWS YOU TO DO IT ALLOWS YOU TO

THE REAL LIFE THE REAGOLANS IS THAT IS THE DOCUMENTARY IT'S ALL IT'S ALREADY BEING WRITTEN YOU'RE IT RIGHT OUT I'M A SHARE A LITTLE NARROW SCIENCE TID BIT THO WHAT I THINK IT'S ONE THAT YOU'LL APPRECIATE I'M MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS BUT THERE'S A BRAIN STRUCTURE CALLED THE ANTERIOR MID SINGULA QUARTEX AS WE POINT OUT BEFORE THAT'S A NOWN IT'S A NAME IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING WE CALL IT THE THE COOKY MONSTER RIGHT BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS BRAIN AREA IS THERE NOW A LOT O DATA IN HUMANS NOTS SOME MOUT STUDY SHOWING THAT WHEN PEOPLE DO SOMETHING THEY DON'T WANT TO DO LIKE ADD THREE HOURS OF EXERCISE PER DAY OR PER WEAK OR WHEN PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO DIE AND LOSE WAIGHT RESIST EATING SOMETHING RIGHT WHEN PEOPLE DO ANYTHING THAT THEY AND THIS IS THE IMPORTANT PART THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO DO RIHT IT'S NOT ABOUT ADDING MORE WORK IT'S ABOUT ADDING MORE WORK THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO DO YES THIS BRAIN AREA GETS BIGGER NOW HERE'S WHAT'S ESPECIALLY INTERESTING ABOUT THIS BRAIN AREA TO ME AND BY THE WAY I'M ONLY LEARNING THIS RECENTLY BECAUSE IT'S NEW DATA BUT THERE'S A LOT OF IT THE ANTEROR MID SINGULAT QUARTEX IT'S SMALLER AN OBES PEOPLE IT GETS BIGGER WHEN THEY DIE IT IT'S LARGER IN ATHLETES IT'S ESPECIALLY LARGE WERE GROWS LARGER IN PEOPLE THAT SEE THEMSELVES AS CHALLENGED AND OVERCOME SOME CHALLENGE RIGHT AND IN PEOPLE THAT LIVE A VERY LONG TIME THIS AREA REKEEPS IT SIZE IN MANY WAYS SCIENTISTS ARE TRYING TO THINK OF THE ANTER AMID SINGULAT QUARTEX NOT JUST AS ONE OF THE SEATS OF WILL POWER RIGHT BUT PERHAPS ACTUALLY THE SEAT OF THE WILL TO LIVE NOWER TALKING AND WHEN I LEARNED ABOUT THE ANTER AMID SINGULAT QUARTEX I WAS LIKE ALMOST OUT OF MY SEAT AND I'V BEEN IN THE NARROW SCIENCE GAME SINCE I WAS TWENTY NOT OF THE SAME AGE AND I WAS SO PUMPE AS I'VE HEARD OF THE MIGDULA ER PREFRONT OL QUARTEX ITS PLANNING AND ACTION I COULN TELL YOU EVERY BRAIN AREA AND EVERY I TEACHING OR ANATOMY TO MEDICAL STUDENTS BUT WHEN I STARTED SEEING THE DATE ON THE ANTER AMID SINGULAR QUARTAX I WAS LIKE WO THIS IS INTERESTING AND ALL THE DATA POINT TO THE FACT THAT WE CAN BUILD THIS AREA UP BUT THAT AS QUICKLY AS WE BUILD IT UP IF WE DON'T CONTINUE TO INVESTIN THINGS THAT ARE HARD FOR US THAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT'S THE PART THAT FEELS SO GOG AND ASK SE ME THAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO AN IF YOU LOVE THE ICE BATH YET I LOVE THE ISPEND YOU GO FROM ONE MINUTE TO TEN MINUTES GUESS WHAT YOUR ANTER AMIDSINGULAR QUARTEX DID NOT GROW BUT IF YOU HATE THE COLD WATER IF YOUR  AFRAID OF DROWNING AND YOU GET INTO WATER AND PUT YOUR HEAD UNDER THEN YOUR ANTER AMIDS AND SURVIVE THEN TH ANTER AMID SINGULAR QUARTEX GETS BIGGER BUT IF YOU DON'T DO IT THE NEXT DAY OR IF YOU DO IT THE NEXT DAY AND YOU ENJOY IT CAUSE  E I DID IT YESTERDAY WHO HAPPY ME MERRY CHRISTMAS IS RAS EVERY CHRISTMAS GETS WHAT THE ANTER AMID SINGULAR QUARTEX SHRINKS AGAIN TO ME THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES THAT NARL SCIENCE HAS EVER MADE BECAUSE IT'S THAT I DON'T WANT TO DO SOMETHING BUT DO IT ANYWAY I'S R THAT GROWS THIS AREA AND IT'S ALMOS AY HAVE A FRIEND HE'S BEEN SOBER THIRTY YEARS FROM ALKOHOL AND YOU LWAYS SAYS YOU KNOW THE AMAZING THING ABOUT A DICTION IS THERE'S A CURE THE PROMISE IT ONLY WORKS ONE DAY AT A TIME AND SELL YOU AFETER REKNEW IT EVERY DAY I SO THE ANER AMID SINGULAR QUARTEX TO ME WHEN I LEARNED ABOUT IT TO TWO THINGS WENT OFF IN MY HEAD WO THIS IS SUPERINTERESTING AND TWO I GOT TELL DAVID COGANS ABOUT THIS AND I WAITED UNTIL NO TO TELL YOU BECAUSE I FELT LIKE I WELL FOR OBVIOUS REASONS I WANT TO TELL YOU HEN I WANT TO TELL YOU HERE WELL I

YOU WERE BLESSED THE STRONG MINE LIK HOW YOU TOM BOUS BLESSE WITH A STRONG MINE YOU THAT'S SUMEN THAT YOU HAVE TO DEVELOP DO YOU BUILT THAT OVER YEARS DECATES OF SUFFERING AN GOING BACK INTO THE SUFFER THAT'S WHY A LOT PEOPLE WHO GRADUATE NAVY STILL TRAIN THET WERE NO I IT MY I TALK ABOUT VERY OPENLY ALL TIME A LOT O GODS DON'T GO YOUON'T DO ON GO BACK INTO THAT WATER THAN WENT O GO BACK INTO THE HARD STUFF IT MAY BE NOT ENSTAY ANYTHING HARD ANYTHING HARD IN LIFE WON'T YOU GET THROUGH IT IS LIK YOU BECOME A PEEL DBU I HO PEL DBYAS YOU KNOW WON GOBOUT THE PUDUB YOU CAMP NONE WHEN SUME SUCK

THAT SHIP RIGHT THERE MAN YEU I BUILD YOU WILL HOW YOU BILD YOU WILL EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID MAN EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID WELL I FEEL LIKE KNOWING THE NAME OF SOMETHING ANTER AMID SINGULAR QUARTEX DOESN'T FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE US BUT ONE THING I LIKE ABOUT BIOLOGY IS THAT WILL POWER IF SOMEBODY FEELS THEY DON'T HAVE IT RI FEELS LIKE THE THING THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE BUT EVERYBODY UNLESS THEI'R BRAIN DAMAGED LIKE A WHOLE RIGHT THROUGH THEIR HEAD HAS TOO ANTER AMID SINGULAR QUARTX ONE ON EACH SIDE OF THEIR BRAIN EVERY ONE HAS ONE THEY HAVE TO SO I FEEL LIKE IT'S JUST TA QUESTION OF OPENING THE PORTOL AND THE PORTOL WHAT I AGAIN I BSINTISAY TEN TIMES HAN FORGIVE ME S I THNK PEOPLE GO OH I DO HARD THINGS I DO SETS TO FAILURE AND THEN I DO FORESTRAPS I LOVE TRAINING WITH WAIGHTS I LOVE DOING SETS TO FAILURE I EVEN LIKE FORSTRAPS BUT GUESS WHAT I LIKE FORSTRAPS SO I I'LL TELL YOU THEY DON'T BUILD MY ANTERMID SINGULAT QARTAX I CAUSE I LIKE TO DO ITSRIGHT ANYTHING YOU LIKE TO DO IS NOT AN ENHANCE THIS ASPECT OF WILL POWER AND IT SEEM SO OBVIOUS ONCE YOU HEAR IT YOU KIND GO WHY OF COURSE BUT I THINK YOU REALLY CLOSE THAT LOOP FOR PEOPLE WHEN YOU SHARE WHAT YOU'RE SHARING TO DAY AND WHAT YOU SHAREID ELSEWHERE BEFORE IS WELL WHEN YOU'RE TRYING T EXPLAINED THE FRICTION IS THE CRITICAL INGREEDIENT RIGHT AND I THINK PEOPLE THINK ALL IF IT'S EFFORT WELL THEN I'M GETTING BETTER THAT'S PART OF IT NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT AS I SAY IN SINE BUT THE SUCK PART THE HAUNT FEET BEING HAUNTED THE STICK THER'RE REALLY UNPLEASANT TERMS ERY IT'S BY THE MOST UNPLEASANT TERMS WE'VE EVER USED ON

TRUETAYMENT E MEN I GOUN'T LIST OFF PROMINENT NAMES IN THE PRESS BUT THOSE ARE ACTUALLY THE LEAST INTERESTING WHAT'S PROBABLY MORE INTERESTING AS AN EXAMPLE IS ALL THE ONES WE DON'T HERABOUT CAUSE WE NEVER HEARABOUT EM RIGHT THEY JUST DWINDLE AND WHITHER OR I THINK THERE'S THIS BIG CATEGORY OF PEOPLE I'M REALIZING AS WE HAVE THIS CONVERSATION TODAY THAT THEY'RE NOT SUPER SUCCESSFUL THEY'RE NOT

GING TO BEW IT IS NOT FOR IT NOT AND THAT'S ALL IT WAS WAS THIS THAT THIS STRUCTURE ANTER AMID SINGULAT QUARTEX HAS I IN PUTS AND OUTPUTS FROM A BUNCH ET PLACES BUT YOU PRI NOT BE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT IT'S STRONGLY ACTIVATED WHEN WE MOVE OUR BODY WHEN WE DON'T WANT TO MOVE OUR BODY I FEEL LIKE IT IT'S LI OU DAVI GOG IT IS THE TRUGUR RIGHT IT REAL IT IS AND IT ALSO HAS STRONG CONNECTIONS TO THE DOPEMING REWARD PATHWAY AND EVERYONE GOES YEA DOPEMING WHAT EVER I LOVES DOPEMING I'M PARTIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR PEOPLE KNOWING A BIT MORE ABOUT DOPEING BUT DOPEMINS BADLY UNDERSTOOD EVERYTHING ITS DOPEMINDOPEMING HITS ITS ABOUT REWARD IT'S ABOUT MOTIVATION AND DRIVE AND THERE ARE PAIN IN PUTS TO THE DOPEING CENTERS OF THE BRAIN NO ONE TALKS ABOUT THAT EVERONES LIKE ALL YOU WANT THE CHOCOLATE YOU KNOW CHOCOLATE SEX COCENE OR YET THAT'S ALL TRUE RIGHT YOU RELEASED OPENING PAIN RELEASE IS DOPENING THAT ENTER AMID SNGULAT QUARTEX CAN TRIGGER THE RELEASE OF DOPEMING IN RESPONSE TO THE THING THAT WE'RE CALLING FRICTION AND THAT'S A LEARNED THING THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NO ANIMAL OR HUMAN BEING COMES INTO THE WORLD LEARNING WE ALL ARE AVERSE TO PAIN AND LIKE PLEASURE LIKE SUGAR FAT DON'T LIKE HOT SURFACES RIGHT BUT THIS IS A STRUCTURE THAT LEARNS IT HAS NEURO PLASTICITY THE ABILITY TO CHANGE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE LIFE SPEN AND HERE'S THE PART THAT I THINK AGAIN IS IS JUST NURROW NERD SPEAK FOR WHAT YOU ALREADY KNOW AND HAVE DONE AND EXEMPLIFY IS THAT IT PEOPLE SAY OH HAS PLASTICITY YOU CAN CHANGE IT BEGESS WHAT HAS PLICIT PLASTESY IN BOTH DIRECTIONS IT CAN GROW BUT JUST AS EASILY AS IT CAN GROW IT'S LIKE SILLY PUDY IT CAN SHRINK RIGHT SO IT REQUIRES CONSTANT UP KEEP RIGHT AND THAT ANSWER ISN'T ONE THAT PEOPLE ARE GEN ALIKE UKNO THEY LIKE GIVE ME THE ENERGY DRAIN GIVE ME THE SUPPLEMENT GIVE ME THE YES GIVE ME THE SON O PROTO CALL THAT CAN A MAKE MY ENTER AMID SINGULAT QUARTEXS THAT SOME ONE OUT THERE RIGHT NOW AS GOING WEIGHT IF I TOOK TRANSTRANUAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION AND OUR STIMULA YE YOU PROBABLY ACTULLY HEY'VE DONE THAT THEY STUCK A LO WIRE DURING YOUR SURGERY INTO THIS STRUCTURE THIS ACTALLY DISCOVERED BY A A COLLEAGUE OF MINE JO PARVESI STIMULATE AND THE PATIENTS GO I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A STORM COMING AND THEY GO ALWAS IT' SCARRINGTHEY GO KNO I WANT TO GO THROUGH IT THEY COME OFF THE STIMULATION AND PEOPLE ALIKE THIS IS THE SEA OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT EXACTLY AND IT LEARNS SO THE FACT THAT YOU'VE KEPT THIS BRAIN STRUCTURE I'M CONVINCED IF WE IMAGE YOUR BRAIN IBE LARGE AND IT WOULD BE LARGER IN TWO YEARS A YEAR BUT THIS IS THE NODAYS OFF RATIONEL CAUSE IT CAN GROW AND IT CAN SHRINK I KNOW WHATS YOUR SAYING RY NOW I DIDN'T KNOW INO THIS AND I NEVER  ALWAYS TAUGHT T I WISH I COULD JUST PUT THIS ON PAPERING AND YOUR SAYING IT IN A WAY THAT PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND I CAN NEVER PUT IN TE WORDS ON WHAT ID BUILT AND THE POWER THAT IS WITHIN ALL OF US BUT YOU PUT IT SO LIKE IN T IN A SCIENTIFIC WAY MOST PEOPLE LIKE FOR ME HE'S US CRAZY IT'S WHA I'T LIKE TALKING ABOUT IT MAN I KNOW I'M NOT CRAZY I KNOW WHAT I HAD TO DO TO GET WHERE I HAD TO GO PEOPLE LOOK IT AS CRAZE BECAUSE YOUR PEOPLE THAT JUST IF YOU CAN'T IMAGINE YOURSELF DOING SOMETHING IF YOU CAN'T IMAGINE YOURSELF DOING SOME THE PERSON HAS DOING ITS CRAZE  BECAUSE IN YOUR MIND THE LOGIC BEHIND IT IT DOESN'T COMPUTE THEREFORE YOU OT TO GIVE SOMEBODY A TITLE N THE TITLE FOR

GET JAS UP EVEN TALKING ABOUT IT MAN BECAUSE SO MAY PEOPLE THINK MY LIFE IS TI SO OH GOD IS LIFE IS HORRIBLE I DON'T DON'T FOLLOW HEM Y'S CRAZY REALLY BUT THERE A GOOD NUMBER OF PEOPLE I WOULD SAY AND THA  UNDERS TAT THAT ACTUALLY  I THINK IT I WHAT I'M HEARING TO DAY AND IT'S REALLY SINKING IN IS THAT A GREAT MANY PEOPLE EITHER PARTHLY OR COMPLETELY MISUNDERSTAND YOU YES I GOT I'LL PUT MYSELF IN THE PARSHLY CATEGOR IC TO BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT JUST FORWARD CENTER OF MASS CARROT CARROT CARROT CRROT BUT IT'S THE STICK IS THE THICK AND IT'S BEING HAUNTED AND YOU KNOW I DO HAVE EXAMPLES FOR MY OWN LIFE WHICH IS NOT WHAT TODAYIS ABOUT BOUT BEING REALLY AFRAID AND THEN TURNING THINGS AROUND  MY BIGGEST FEAR IS GETTING COMFORTABLE I DO NOT HAVE AS MUCH OF A STICK ORIENTED APPROACH BUT TO DAYIS CONVERSATIONS CHANGING THE WAY I THINK I'M LI GU STEP AWAY FROM THIS AND THINK OKAT THERE TWENTY FIVE MORAL CIRCUITS THAT CAN EXPLAIN TELL OTHER THNGS THAT DAVID'S TALKING ABOUT AND WHAT I'M THINKING ABOUT IS THE FACT THAT EVERYBODY HAS A BRAIN THEY'VE A MIND FORGET THE BRAIN THE RAINS IS THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURE BUT WHAT THAT MANIFEST WHAT THAT CREATES IS THE MIND AND EVERYBODY HAS THAT SO I DO BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE HAS THE CAPACITY TO DO WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AT SOME LEVEL I ALSO WILL BE THE FIRST TO CONFESS THAT I THINK YOU ARE HIGHLY UNUSUAL LET'S JUST SAY MAYBE EVEN AND OF ONE AS WE SAY INSIDE SAMPLE SIZE OF ONE SOMEBODY WHOIS CREATED THIS PROCESS FOR THEMSELVES AND KEEPS THEM IN THIS THEMSELVES IN THIS FORWARD CENTER MASS WITH THE STICK BATTERING THE BACK O THEIR HEAD ALL THE TIME HIGHLY UNUSUAL BUT THIS INTERNAL MEDLESON CABINET THE YOURE TIME BOUT BUILDING UP TRUE CONFIDENTE NOT NEETING ANYTHING FROM THE OUTSIDE I THINK I LIKE TO THINK THAT PEOPLE WANT THAT THEY WANT TO BE KNOWN THEY'RE AFRAID BUT THAT THEY WANT TO BE KNOWN FOR WHO THEY REALLY ARE AND THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING THE PAST TO DO THIS AND I WILL SAY I'M IMMENSELY GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE TALKING TO US THIS WAY TO DAY ABOUT THINGS YEU'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE BUT WE'RE HIDDEN IN A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY I LIKE TO THINK VERY DIFFERENT BECAUSE WHAT YOU TALKING ABOUT IS A PROCESS IT'S VERBS IT'S ALL VERBS ALL ACTION AND IT'S NOT ABOUT SUCCESS IT'S MORE ACTUALLY ABOUT KEEPING THAT FRICTION DIL TO TEN AND THAT I NO ENERGY DRINK NO SUPPLEMENT PEOPLE OFTEN MISUNDERSTAND ME THEY THINK YOU KNOW LIKE I'M BIG ON PEOPLE GAING SUNLIGHT IN THE MORNINGS EXCEPT THE CIRCADIAN RHYTHM AND GET BETTER SLEEP AS THEY CAN ET CETERA BUT THEN PEOPLE ALWAYS THINK THEY GO STRAIGHT TO THE SUPPLEMENTS WHAT SHOULD I TAKE YOU KNW AND THEN THT COURSE PEOPLE THNG EM ALL ABOUT SUPPLEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTS ARE ONE PIECE FOR ME BUT IT'S LIKE TINY FRACTION COMPARED TO THE ETHE DOING THE DOS AND DON'TS THAT'S WHAT HI WONT TALK ABOUT THAT TO DAY THAT'S FROM GAT WAS HUNG ABOUT THIS THIS IS IT THIS IS IT LIKE THE BRAIN ISTHE MOST POWERFUL WEPN IN THE WORLD AND IS ES CRAZY HOW A KID THAT WAS IT REAL SMART I WAS FORCED TO GO ONLY INTERNAL EXTERNAL HAD TO GO AWAY THE EXTERNAL WORLD HAD TO GO AWAY IN LIVING SO DEEP INSIDE MYSELF IT WAS ME IN THIS BRAIN IN FIGURE NOUT HOW THIS THING WORKS AND I'S SO MANY PEOPLE ARE DOING EXACTLY THAT THE SUPPLEMENTS THO THIS TO THAT I AGREE IT HELPS BUT ONCE YOU FIGURE OUT YOUR YOUR BRAIN YOU BECOME UNSTOPPABLE TO ALMOST ANYTHING YET YOU CAN'T BEAT DEATH YOU CAN'T WHATEVER WHATEVER YOUR BRAIN'S AMAZING ONCE YOU FEED IT THE RIGHT CONVERSATION THE RIGHT MENTAL NEUTRIENTS THE RIGHT MENTAL SUPPLEMENTS THE RIGHT THE RIGHT INTERNAL DIALOGUE AT THE RIGHT TIME WITH THE RIGHT HIT WITH THE RIGHT PROOF OF WHICH YOU'VE DONE IN THE PAST AND YOU SEND AT RIGHT TO THE RIGHT CIRCUIT DO YOU'RE A FUCKING BEAST A BEAST BUT MUNCT AGAIN YOU JUST CAN'T READ ABOUT IT YOU CAN'T SIT BACK AND BE A THEORIST YOU HAVE TO BE A FUCKING PRACTITIONER AND IN THAT PRACTISE IS WHERE THAT BECOMES PROOF POSITIVE WHAT I'M SAYING IS LIK GOD DAVID GOGNES HT IT'S BLOW IN MY MIND WHIT IS THIS HE'S NOT T CRAZY IT'S SO MANY PEOPLE A LOT OF PEOPLE HI'VE LISTEN TO ME IN THE RIGHT WAY AND THEY COME BACK LIK I'M TOLD YO ON BOARD IIT HAPPENED IT HAPPENED I THER'LL KEEP GOING MAY TOR KEEP DOING IT BUT THAT IS IT MAN THERE'S NO SUN THERE'S NO GLORY THERE'S NO CURIT HERE'S NO VICTORY BUT THERE IS ALL OF IT IN ONE I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT WE' OU TO PEOPLE MAA BUT WOULD YOU GET THE OTHER END IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE ALWAYS FOUND THERE'E NEVER LOST ANY MORE THERESN'T MEN TO JOURNEYS EASY THES N'T GETIAN EASIER BUT YOU'REALWAYS FOUND WL OLL THAT IT'S ONT A HOVER ON THAT FIRST SET THE SAME WAY WE HOVERED ON HAUNTED AND ISN'T IT I THINK PEOPLE FEEL LOST I'VE CERTAINLY FELT LOST OF TIMES IN MY LIFE I'M MANY TIMES AND THE OTHERE'S THAT THING I DON'T THINK THERE'S A NEROU SCIENCE OR PSYCHOLOGY TERM FOR IT SOME ONE WILL SAY PUT IN THE COMMENTS AND SAY OH YED THAT'S WHAT SO AND SO SAID BUT TAK YOU SAID WE'RE NOT TRYNG TO BE THEORETICAL HERE RETURNED T BE PRACTICAL THE BUSINESS O FINDING YOURSELF AND KNOWING LIKE BUT IT' SORE LIKE I'M SAFE BECAUSE I'M IN DANGER AND I'VE BEEN IN DANGER BEFORE AND I GOT MYSELF OUT IT ALWAYS ALWAYS SEEMS TO COME BACK TO VERBS AGAIN I DON'T HAVE A LANGUAGE FOR THIS YOU KNOW FOR ONCE I'M LOST FOR WORDS THERE'S I IT'S IT'S ABOUT O A PROCESS THE ALGARITHM AND YOU AND THE REASON HERE I'M JUST KIND OF TRY TO MAKE SURE I'M UNDERSTANDIN THINGS CORRECTLY ONE OF THE REASONS WHY IT MUST BE UNCOMFORTABLE FOR YOU TO BE WHO YOU ARE PUBLICLY IT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT US FOLKIS ON THE RUNNING OR THE SWEARING AND BY THE WAY THE SWEARING IS IS WELCOME I'LL TAY I CAME UP THROUGH LABORATORIES WE'RE ALL THREE PEOPLE I WORKED FOR SWORE A LOT BUT THERE WAS ONE RULE I COULDN'T SWEAR AT PEOPLE SO MY GRADU ADVISER BRILLIANT WOMAN I'M FORTUNING SHE DIED EARLY THEY ALL DIED EARLY I'M THE COMMON DENOMINATOR I HAD THAT INTERNAL LIZE FOR A LONG TIME RANYWAY SHE SAID BUT IF YOU SWEAR IT PEOPLE YOU'RE OUT RIGHT BUT YOU CAN SWEAR AS MUCH AS YOU WANT SO THAT'S THAT'S THE RULE I HAVE IT'S I CAN SWEAR AS MUCH AS OU WANT UST DON'T SWEAR AT PEOPLE IF YOU SWEAR IT PEOPLE BETTER BE RAD TO FIGHT RIGHT RIGHT OVEING I CAN FIGHT YOU S YOU CAN SWEAR ME GET AWAY WI BUT THE FACT TO THE MATTER IS THE YOT MUST BE FRUSTRATING THAT PEOPLELE CAUSE I KNOW PEOPLE O IT'S TAT IT'S ALL ABOUT SUPPLEMENTS AND ICE BADS I LISTEN I LIKE SUPPLEMENTS A LOVE SUPPLEMENTS AND ICE BADS BUT THAT'S NOT THE FULL PICTURE THEY JUST A GRAVITATIONAL PULL T'S THE SWEARING IT'S THE RUNNING IT'S HIS FEET THAT ARE ALL MESSED UP IT'S THE FACT THAT HE GOT A TRITING IT'S IS SEAL GOT  TALKN ABOUT THAT TOO RIGHT YOU KNOW AND THERE'S A GRAVITATIONAL PULL FOR PEOPLE AND THE'RE MISSING LIKE THE THAT'S LIKE THE TIP OF THE ICEBURG IS WHAT I'M REALIZEING I'M REALIZING THAT TO DAY THANKS DOWAY YOU'RE PHRASING THINGS CAUSE THE BIGGER VESSEL IS ALL IN HERE IN AS YOU SAID HOW D YOU PUT THAT IN A BOOK IIS IMPOSSIBLE TIS HIGHLY INDIVIDUAL YET YOU DO IT YOUR WAY YES AND YOU'RE SAYING EVERYONE NEEDS TO GO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT THEIR WAY FOR THEM YES AND THE THING ABOUT BEING MISINISTER'S VERY FIRST RATING MORE THEN I CAN EVEN IMAGINE I I CAME IEX EXPRESS HOW FIRST RING IT IS WHEN THE CUSYIN EVERYTHING COMES FROM A

REAL AND I CAN'T BE ON THESE PA CES THEY CAN'T TALK O ANYBY WITOUT BE REAL I'LL GO AWAY IT'S GO AWAY CAUS I I I CAN'T GIVE YOU WHAT I WANT TO GIVE YOU YOU SAID PERISHABLE SKILL I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER WORD SAID A WORD TO IN A HIGH LIGHT CA SKILL IMPLIES BEHAVIOUR AND WHEN WE'RE JUST TALKING A SECOND AN GO ABOUT THE DEEP TRUE BETEROC SENSE OF CONFIDENCE THAT COMES FROM LOOKIN SOME ONE IN THE EYE AND TELLING  SOMEBODY SOMETHING YOU ABSOLUTELY KNOW IT'S TRUE BECAUSE IT HAPPENED YOU'RE ROING ABOUT ACTIONS NOT TELLING MOUT PERCEPTIONS YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT WHAT YOU BELIEVE HAPPENED YOU KNOW IT HAPPENED ANDTHERE'S SOMETHING REALLY CONCRETE ABOUT ACTIONS AND THAT'S WHAT SO INTERESTING AS WERE TIE ABOUT THE MIND BUT ACTIONS ARE THE MANIFESTATION OF THE MIND AND I AND THE STUFF THAT JUST STAYS IN HERE PEOPLE DIE WITH THAT IT DOESN'T GO ANYWHERRE I I LONG AGOW SOMEBOD HE SAID TAT YOU KNOW I FORGOT WHAT THE CONTEXT WAS WAS A NORW SCIENTISTS HE SAID YOU KNOW MOST EMOTIONS LIKE THER'RE JUST EMOTIONS THEYRE JUST IN THERE BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING WITH EM AND I THINK CERTAIN MOTIONS YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING WITH RIGHT BUTI THNK PEOPLE FORGET THIS THEY FEEL MISERABLE LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO DISSALT AN TO PUDDLE OF THEIR OWN TEARS NO ONE EVER DIED FROM AN EMOTION RIGHT BUT THEY FEEL LIKE THAT THEY OVERWHELM US AS IF IT'S A TIDALWAY THAT'S GOING TO PULL US UNDER AND DROWN US IT'S SO INTERESTING TO ME BECAUSE I THINK WHAT PEOPLE THE SIMPT YOU HAVE A GRAVITATION FOR PEOPLE CAN FEEL THE ENERGY I THINK YAS YOUR EITHER COMPLETELY BADLY OR PARTIALLY UNDERSTOOD THERE'S ONLY ONE GEYE ON THE PLANT THAT TRULY UNDERSTANDS YOU I THIN THERE'S ONE WOMAN GENIPHER WHO PROBABLY UNDERSTANDS YOU AS MUCH AS ANY ONE'S GOING TO AND THEN THE REST OF US ARE KIND OF GRASP AND TRYIN TO FIGURE IT OUT RIGHT BUT YOU'RE SIN GO INWARD SO FIRST GO INWARD AND THEN IT'S ACTIONS INWARD AN ACTIONS AT THE INWARD PIECE IS SOMETHING I'D LIKE TOU TO SPEND A LITTLE BY TIME ON BECAUSE THERE' COUPLE CHARACTERS FROM HISTORY PEOPLE THAT WE'RE IN CONCENTRATION CANMP NELSON MEN DELLA A I'M NOT SURE HE HAD INSTER GRAHAMAN THERE 'N PRESTERING DIDN'T AND I DON'T THIN THERE WAS ANY ONE COACHING IM ON LIKE HAY YOU'RE GING TO GET OUT SOME DAY AND ACTUALLY YOU'REGING TO LEAD AN ENTIRE COUNTRY I'M PRETTY SURE THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKED HE HAD TO FIND IT HERE HE HAD TO FIND IT BETWEEN HIS EARS RIGHT AND THERE ARE OTHER EXAMPLES BUT THAT'S A AN IMPORTANT ONE SO THE PROCESS OF GOING INWARD DOES IT FOR YOU AND HERE I WILL ASK FOR SUGGESTIONS CAUSE I THINK PEOPLE WANT THERE ARE THOSE OF US WHO WANT TO BUILD THIS SKILL RIGHT WALL YOURSELF OFF TOWN OFF FOR BIG PORTIONS OF THE DAY PERHAPS TEXTING OFF  REQUESTS O THIS TO THAT ANY ONE THAT KNOWS YOU KNOWS THAT WE'VE COMMUNICATE A FEW TACTS BUT MOST OF IT COMES THROUGH A FILTER SHE'S GRAT SHE KNOWS YOU YOU KNOW AND SHE KNOWS HOW TO PROTECT YOUR TIME AND THE HURSTUP WAS FEELINGS BE I GET MAD A A ED GOD BLESS GOD BLESS YOU GAN FOR YOU KNOW CUTTING ONESELF OFF WHEN YOU'RE IN THERE YOU SAY IT'S JUST YOU AND THE VOICES THAT COME UP ARE NOT PLEASANT AND THEN IT'S SOME POINT IT CONVERTS TO ACTION OK HOW MUCH WHAT IS THE PROCESS OF PICKING THE ACTION THAT'S THE PIECE THAT I FEEL LIKE WEE THERE'S LIKE A A BRIDGE TO BUILD HERE IF YOU CAN IF YOU WOULD STO THE ACTION ME LIKE LIKE S LIKE WHAT'S NEXT YES OR WHAT LIKE ME WHEN YOU GO GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT WHEN THAT HAPPENS YOU KN WHA YOU'REGING TO DO THE NEXT DAY IT'S PREPLAN YES OE YES IS T IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME THING YOU'RE NOT BUILDING IT ON THE FLY NO NOTHING ON THE FLY NOTHING IN SO HOW WORKS INTERNALLY FOR ME IS I'M I I PUT THAT EXACTLY HOW IT IS I'M AN ARTIST AND EVERY DAN POINT I'M I'M PAINTING MORALLYS EVERYDAY AND BUTS TA DIFFERENT ONE 'S NOT THE SAME PAINTIN SO EVERYDY I WAKE I BON O DO THE SAME THING IT TAKES A DIFFERENT WAY TO GET THERE S EVERY DAY MY MY I'M GOING THROUGH MY MIND I'M JISTLIKE AND A GOOD PAINTER WOR NOT JUST PAIN'T AND E'S TO CREATE AND YOU CAN'T CREATE WI PHONES AND EVERYTHING GOING AROUND YOU SO YOU GOT IT BLOCK YOURSELF OFF YOU MAY DO TOO PY CASTIN TO YERE YOU BLOCK YOURSELF OFF AND YOU'RE AND YOU'RE PAINTING THIS THING INSIDE AND YOU'RE GOING THROUGH ALL THESE DIFFERENT COLORS OF PAINT AND EVERYTHING ELSE AND YOU CAN ONLY FIGURE OUT THE RIGHT PAINTING IF YOU SPEND THET CORRECT HIM ON A TIME IN YOUR BRAIN SO EVERY SINGLE DAY I'M LEARLY GOIH O MIN AND I'M PAINTING I'M CREATING THIS THIS MASTERPIECE THEN MASTER PIECE IS ALWAYS MYSELF AND BUT TO DO THAT YOU CAN NOT HAVE ANY DISTRACTIONS BECAUSE IF YOU'RE TALKING TO AN ARTIST AND HE'S TRYING TO THINK ABOUT THE NEXT PAINTING YOU CAN'T SOM I IS IMPOSSIBLE TO LISTEN TO YOU AND LISTEN TO WHICH YOUR MIND AND BIDY ARE TELLING YOU WE MUST DO YOU WON'T DO ENOUGH OF DON'T DO ANY OF IT YOUR THEY ON'T HAVE PASSION THAT THEY LIKE PASSIN DRIVE DETERMINATION BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T SPENT TIME WITH YOURSELF YYOUR MIND WILL TELL YOU WHAT IS NEXT BUT YOU HAVEN'T SPENT THE TIME TO GO I THET ME DIS FIGURE THIS OUT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR LET ME GO GO THIS AND LET ME GOGLE THAT AND LET ME YOU NI CAN TO FIND IT THERE BECAUSE THERE'S THINGS OF PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD AND THEY'RE ALL SUPPOSED TO BE INDIVIDUALS WE'VE A PACKMEN TALITY IT'S FOR YOU SO FUCK AND LOST WHY AN I SO UNIQUE I'M BEEN EXACTLY THO FUCK O SPOSE TO BE I AM FALSE SHID IN MI DID FALLO SHIT I' LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE THE SECOND I SAID O CAY MAN HANG ON

PSYCHOLOGIST AS I MENTION BEFORE BUT I'M AN ADVENTURE A HYPOTHESIS HERE I THINK THAT YOU'VE MASTERD THE PROCIS OF INTERNAL DIALOGUE BUT WHEN I SAY DIALOGUE I THINK MOST PEOPLE THINK O THE THE INNER VOICE THAT THE THE CHATTER BUT THAT'S JUST ONE HALF OF A DIALOGUE AT DIALOGUE IS A TO WAS STREET SO I COMPLETELY AGREE CAUSE I KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE THAT WHEN WE GO IN WERD OFTEN TIMES WE HEAR THINGS IND FORE REALLY ONUST WITH OURSELVES IS LIKE IN THINK ABOUT THAT OR THAT NO AND THEN WE START LOOKING OUT WORD ARE WE START TRYING TO SHIFT OUR ATTENTION AND DISTRACT AND THE'RE MILLYON REASONS THAT ARE HANDED TO US EXCUSES AND SEEMINGLY GOOD JUSTIFICATIONS TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT BUT DIALOGUEIS A TO WAYS STREET AND IT HIT ME WHILE YOU ARE JUST SAYING WHAT YOUARE SAYING I WAS PAYING VERY CLOSE ATTENTION AND I REALIZE DAE DOGUEANS IS TALKING ABOUT THE VOICE THAT COMES UP INCLUDING THE TERRIBLE STUFF THAT NO ONE WANTS TO HEAR ABOUT THEMSELVES FROM THEMSELVES BUT THEN HE'S ALSO GOT THE

THAT KIND CONVERSATION FOR ME WENT AWAY ALONG O TIME AGO WHICH IS WHY THE DIALOGUE AS NOW WHICH YOU SEE A LOUT OF ACTION BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE HAVE INACTION TAUSE THI'S ONE PERSON TALKING AND THAT ONE

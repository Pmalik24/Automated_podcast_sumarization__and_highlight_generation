WELCOME TO THE HUBERMEN LAON  A SCIENCE  SCIENCE TAYE TO NI MANDURE HUBERMEN AND OM OUR PROFESSOR OF NERBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY WE ARE DISCUSSING HAPPINESS WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS THE SCIENCE OF HAPPINESS BECAUSE INDEED THERE ARE EXCELLENT LABORATORIES THAT HAVE WORKED FOR MANY DECADES TO TRYING UNDERSTAND WHAT IS THIS THING THAT WE CALL HAPPINESS AND WHAT BRINGS US HAPPINESS IN THE SHORT AND LONG TERM FACT WE COULD PROBABLY POING TO HAPPINESS AS ONE OF THE MOST SOUGHT AFTER STATES OR COMMODITIES OR EMOTIONS WHATEVE YOU ONE TO CALL IT HAPPINESS IS WHAT MANY PEOPLE ARE SEEKING IN WORK IN RELATIONSHIPS AND IN GENERAL AND YET MOST OF US CAN'T REALLY DEFINE EXACTLY WHAT HAPPINESS IS OR MEANS FOR US WE CAN POING TO CERTAIN EXPERIENCES WE CAN TRY AND DESCRIBE OUR STATES OF MIND AND BODY BUT MOST PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THE FEELING WHEND WE HAPVE IT AND WE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THE FEELING OF NOT BEING HAPPY WHETHER OR NOT THAT MEANS SIMPLY NOT BEING HAPPY AS THE ABSENCE OF HAPPINESS OR ALL OUT DEPRESSION NW ONE OF THE KEY PROBLEMS IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HAPPINES AND INDEED THE SCIENCE AND PSYCHOLOGY OF HAPPINESS IS THAT IT DOES INDEED INVOLVE OTHER SIMILAR THINGS THINGS LIKE JOY AND GRATITUDE AND MEANING AND INDEED MANY SCIENTISTS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS HAVE ARGUED FOR MANY MANY DECADES ABOUT WHAT HAPPINESS REALLY IS NOW WE CAN COME UP WITH SO CALLED OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS OF HAPPINESS OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS OR SLLY AGREED UPON TERMS OR AGREED UPON DEFINITIONS AND CONDITIONS THAT WILL DEFINE SOMETHING SUCH AS HAPPINESS MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE CAN ALL PROBABLY COME UP WITH AN OPERATIONAL DEFINITION OF MILK BUT OF COURSE MILK CAN BE COWS MILK IT CAN BE OAKED MILK IT CAN BE SO I MILK ET CETERA ET CETERA SO TOO SOMETHING LIKE HAPPINESS CAN BE MICRO DIVIDED AND SLICED ENDISED INTO AS MANY THINGS AS WE DECIDE TO DAY WE ARE REALLY GOING TO FOCUS ON THREE MAIN THINGS FIRST WE ARE GOING TO DEFINE HAPPINESS AS A BRAIN STATE AND AS A STATE OF MIND AND BODY WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A LIOKAT WHAT THE SCIENCE SAYS ABOUT ALL OF THAT SECOND WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT TOOLS AND PRAPCTICES FOR PLACING OURSELVES INTO STATES OF HAPPINESS AND WHILE FOR MOST OF US WE THINK OF HAPPINESS AS SOMETHING THAT ONLY ARRIVES THROUGH THE ACQUISITION OF SOME GOAL OR SOME THING EXTERNAL TO US ND OF COURSE THAT IS TRUE THERE IS ALSO SOMETHING CALLED SYNTHETIC HAPPINESS OR SYNTHESIZED HAPPINESS WHICH TURNS OUT TO BE AT LEAST AS POWERFUL AND PERHAPS EVEN MORE POWERFUL NOW JUST SAY RIGHT OFF THE BAT THAT I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU THAT ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SIT IN A CHAIR AND IMAGINE BEING HAPPY IN ORDER TO FEEL HAPPY SYNTHESIZE HAPPINESS ACTUALLY INVOLVE SOME VERY CONCRETE STEPS THAT HAVE BEEN DEFINED BY EXCELLENT LABS AND PSYCHOLOGIS S WEARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SYNTHESIZED HAPPINESS AS IT RELATES TO WHAT YOU CAN DO TO OBTAIN HAPPY STATES MORE READILY OR MORE FREQUENTLY AND THEN THIR RED WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE MISCONCEPTIONS OR WHAT I WOULD CALL THE CONTRADICTIONS OF HAPPINESS FOR SEARCH AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS MOST OF YOU VE PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT THE GENERAL CONDITIONS FOR OBTAINING HAPPINESS AND THEY ALWAYS SEEM TO CIRCLE BACK TO SOME OF THE SAME BASIC FEATURES OF GET GREAT SLEEP HAVE GREAT SOCIAL CONNECTION PURSUE MEANING DON'T FOCUS TO ANY OVER EXTENT ON THINGS LIKE PURSUING MONEY BECAUSE THERE ARE INDEED THESE STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT PEOPLE MAKES DOES NOT NECESSARILY SCALE DIRECTLY WITH HAPPINESS WELL TALK ABOUT THOSE STUDIES IN SOME DETAIL LOB IT LATER AND WHILE ALL OF THAT LITERATURE IS VERY POWERFUL AND IN FORMATIVE THERE IS WHAT I SEE AS A CONTRADICTION WHICH IS FOR INSTANCE THAT FOR MANY OF US INCLUDING MYSELF SPECIALLY IN THE YEARS WHEN I WAS IN GRADUATE SCHOOL AND A POSTOC THERE WERE TIMES IN WHICH PURSUING AND BEING INVOLLVED IN WORK IN PURSUING DEGREES AND FINDING MEANING IN MY VOCATION ACTUALLY SEPARATED ME FROM THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE QUITE AS MANY SOCIAL CONNECTIONS OR QUITE AS MUCH SLEEP OR QUITE AS MUCH EXERCISE OR EVEN QUITE AS MUCH SUNSHINE FOR THAT MATTER SO ALL O THE THINGS THAT WERE TOLD THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO ACCESS HAPPINESS ON A REGULAR BASIS OFTENTIMES CONTRADICT WITH THE PRESSURES AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF NOTJOUST DAILY LIFE BUT IN BUILDING A LIFE THAT ALLOWS US TO HAVE THE KIND OF RESOURCES THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO HAVE THINGS LIKE QUALITY SOCIAL CONNECTION AND THE TIME AND OPPORTUNITY TO GET REGULAR EXERCISE AND GREAT NUTRITION ET CETERA ET CETERA SO AGAIN WHILE THIS ISN'T NECESSARILY A COMPLAINT WITH ANY OF THE RESEARCH OUT OF THE FIELDS OF PSYCHOLOGY ON HAPPINESS IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE THESE CONTRADICTIONS THAT EXIST IN THE DISCUSSION AROUND HAPPINESS IN PARTICULAR THE POPULAR DISCUSSIONS AROUND THE SCIENCE OF APPINESS SO TO DAY WHAT WE ARE GOING TO ARRIVE AT WHAT YOU WILL FINISH THIS EPISODE WITH IS A SET OF TOOLS AND A FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS IN THE SHORT AND LONG TERM AS IT RELATES TO THE RESEARCH FROM PSYCHOLOGY BUT ALSO THE NEURO SCIENCE AND MY GOAL TO DAY IS REALLY TO TRY AND PLACE THAT ALL INTO A STRUCTURED FRAME WORK SO THAT YOU CAN KNOW WHERE YOU ARE IN YOUR JOURNEY ORE THE LANDSCAPE AROUND HAPPINESS IN YOUR PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS AND WHAT I WON'T TELL YOU IS THAT YOU NEED TO ABANDON ALL GOALS IN TERMS OF PURSUING MONEY CAREER ET CETERA AND SIMPLY FOCUS ON RELATIONSHIPS BUT WE WILL TALK ABOUT WHAT CONSTITUTES AND EXCELLENT SOCIAL BOND OR EVEN IN EXCELLENT CONVERSATION THERE'S EXCELLENT RESEARCH THAT POINTS OF THE FACT THAT EVEN RATHER SHALLOW CONNECTIONS THAT IS CONNECTIONS BETWEEN PEOPLE THAT YOU HAPPENED JOT SEE IN THE HALLWAY ON A REGULAR BASIS NOT EVEN REQUIRING CLOSE BONDS OF ANY KIND CAN BE BUILT INTO CLOSE BONDS THAT CAN DELIVER A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF FEELING AND GENUINE SOCIAL CONNECTION PROVIDED CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET SO TO DAY AGAIN IS REALLY ABOUT ONDERSTANDING THE SCIENCE OF HAPPINESS UNDERSTANDING THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING WHAT WE CALL HAPPINESS AND PROVIDING YOU A FRAME WORK BY WHICH YOU CAN PURSUE AND ACHIEVE HAPPINESS NOT JUST AS A LONG TURM GOAL AND NOT JUST AS A DAY TO DAY GOAL OF LITTLE MICHOREXERCISES OF GRATITUDE ET CETERA BUT RATHER AS A WAY TO THINK ABOUT HAPPINESS AS A STATE THAT YOU HAVE CONTROL OVER AT LEAST IN TERMS OF YOURABILITY TO ACCESS WHAT I WILL CALL THE ALGARYTHMS THAT ENABLE US OR OPEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPERIENCE HAPPINESS NOW BEFORE WE BEGIN TO DAY'S EPISODE I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT A VERY SPECIFIC TOOL THAT APPLIES YES TO ARE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS BUT ACT JULLY TO UR PURSUIT OF EVERYTHING INCLUDING QUALITY SLEEP AND ON GOING MOTIVATION ET CETERA I'VE TALKED MANY MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCASTS AND ON OTHER PODCASTS AND ON SOCIAL MEDIA ABOUT THE CRITICAL VALUE OF GETTING REGULAR BRIGHT LIGHT I DEALLY SUNLIGHT IN YOUR EYES WITHIN THE FIRST HOUR OF WAKING OR IF THE SUN ISN'T HOUT WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING TO TURN ON A LOT OF BRIGHT ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS AND THEN GET SUNLIGHT IN YOUR EYES FOR ANYWHERE FROM FIVE TO TWENTY MINUTES TO PENNY ON HOW CLOUDY IT IS IN THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY ABSOLUTELY OUTSIZED EFFECTS ON MOOD AND FOCUS DURING THE DAY AND QUALITY OF SLEEP AT NIGHT NOW THERE'S ANOTHER TOR SENTIAL TENET OF GETTING GREAT SLEEP AND IMPROVING MOOD AND FOCUS THOUGHOUT THE DAY AND THAT'S TO AVOID BRIGHT ARTIFICIAL LIGHT EXPOSURE TO YOUR EYES BETWEEN THE HOURS OF ABOUT TEN P M TO FOUR A M NOW LEAVING SHIFT WORKERS ASIDE AND WE HAVE AN ENTIRE EPISO DEVOE TO SHIFT WORK MOST PEOPLE ARE ASLEEP AT NIGHT AND AWAKE DURING THE DAY AND YOU WOULD BE WISE TO AVOID EXPOSURE OF YOUR EYES TO BRIGHT ARTIFICIAL LIGHT BETWEE THE HOURS OF TEN P M AND FOUR A M IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE SCREENS ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS DIM THEM DOWN AS FAR AS YOU C M NOW THERE ARE SEVERALT STUDIES THAT POINT TO THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE MAJOR ISSUES WITH GETTING BRIGHT LIGHT IN YOUR EYES BETWEEN THE HOURS OF TEN P M AND FOUR A M IS THAT IT HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE SO CALLED DOPOMENERGIC OR DOPOMINE CIRCUITS OF THE BRAIN M BODY WHICH KN ENHANCE DEPRESSION THAT IS LEAD TO ON GOING LOWER MOOD AND AFFECT THAT'S A REASON TO DIM THE LIGHTS OR AVOID BRIGHT LIGHTS BETWEEN TEN P M AND FOUR A M HOWEVER I AND MANY OTHERS NEED TO USE ARTIFICIAL LIGHT IN SCREENS SOMETIMES EVEN BETWEEN THE HOURS OF TEN P M AND MIDNIGHT OR EVEN MIDNIGHT TO THREE A M DEPENDING ON WHAT'S GOING ON IN MY LIFE OR YOUR LIFE THAT MAY INCLUDE YOU AS WELL NOW IT TURNS OUT THAT THERE ARE POWERFUL WAYS TO OFFSET SOME NOT ALL BUT SOME OF THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF VIEWING ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS BETWEEN THE HOURS OF TEN P M AND FOUR A M AND ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL WAYS TO DO THAT IS TO SIMPLY ADJUST THE OVERALL BRIGHTNESS OF YOUR ARTIFICIAL LIGHTING THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND IN THE EVENING TO ONE OF THE ISSUES NOWDAYS THAT WE'RE REALLY FACING IS THAT PEOPLE ARE SIMPLY NOT GETTING ENOUGH BRIGHT LIGHT IN THEIR EYES FROM SUNLIGHT OR FROM OTHER SOURCES DURING THE DAYTIME AND THEY'RE GETTING FAR TOO MUCH BRIGHT LIGHT IN THEIR EYES LARGELY FROM ARTIFICIAL SOURCES OF COURSE IN THE EVENING AND AT NIGHT NOT JUST FROM TEN P M TOFOR A M BUT ALSO IN THE EVENING E HOURS FROM SIX TO TEN P M AND SO ON AND SO FORTH SO A VERY SIMPLE YET POWERFUL SOLUTION THAT SUPPORTED BY PU U REVIEWED RESEARCH INHUMANS I'S TO TRY AND MAKE YOU ARE INDOOR WORKING AND OR HOME ENVIRONMENT DURING THE DAY AS BRIGHT AS POSSIBLE NW IF YOU CAN ACHIEVE THAT THROUGH DIRECT SUNLIGHT TERRIFIC IF YOU CAN GET OUTSIDE A LOT DURING THE DAYTIME TERRIFIC BUT MANY PEOPLE SIMPLY CANNOT BUT MOST PEOPLE DO HAVE SOME WINDOWS IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT REALIZE SUM DON'T BUT MOST PEOPLE DO AND AS A CONSEQUENCE MOST PEOPLE ARE USING RATHER DIM ARTIFICIAL LIGHTING INDOORS DURING THE DAY AND THEN VERY BRIGHT ARTIFICIAL LIGHTING INDOORS IN THE EVENING AND AT NIGHT THAT'S A PROBLEM AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT LOGICALLY YOU WANT TO DO THE EXACT REVERSE SO IT'S BEEN SHOWN THAT IF YOU SIMPLY INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF BRIGHT ARTIFICIAL LIGHT THAT YOU ARE EXPOSED TO DURING THE DAY AND REMEMBER THIS IS NOT AN EXCUSE TO NOT GET YOUR MORNING SUNLIGHT VIEWING BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT TO MAKE YOUR INDOR ARTIFICIAL LIGHT VERY BRIGHT BRIGHT BRIGHT BRIGHT BRIGHT THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND THEN MUCH DIMMER FROM THE HOURS OF SIX P M UNTIL BEDTIME OR IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT THAN MAY BE AS SOON AS YOU GET HOME FROM ABOUT EIGHT P M UNTIL BHED TIME AND THEN DIM THEM WAYWAY DOWN BETWEEN TEN P M AND FOR M ERE OFF ENTIRELY THAT'S GOING TO BE A FAR BETTER PATTERN FOR YOUR SLEEP WAKE CYCLES FOCUS MOOD ET CETERA THEN WHAT MOST PEOPLE DO WHICH IS TO HAVE A FEW WINDOWS IN THEIR INDOOR WORKING ENVIRONMENT DURING THE DAY AND KEEP THE INDOOR LIGHTS RATHER DIM AT A TIME WHEN THEY NEED MORE FHOTONS MORE LIGHT ENERGY AND THEN THEN EVENING WHEN THEY GET HOME BECAUSE IT'S DARK OUTSIDE THEY TEND TO TURN THE LIGHTS MUCH BRIGHTER YOU HASH SYOU WANT TO DO THE REVERSE NOW THERE'S AN EVEN SIMPLER SOLUTION WHICH IS TO GET SOME BRIGHT SUNLIGHT IN YOUR EYES RIGHT AROUND THE TIME OF SUNSET IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE EXACTLY AT SUNSET IT COULD BE IN THE LATE AFTERNOON AND EVENING BUT IT'S BEEN SHOWN NOW IN STUDIES ON HUMANS ANDALL PROVIDE A LINK TO AT LEAST ONE OF THOSE STUDIES THAT BY GETTING SOME BRIGHT LIGHT IN YOUR EYES IDEALLY FROM SUNLIGHT IN THE LATE AFTERNOON AND EVENING AND OF COURSE THE TIMING WILL VARY DEPENDING ON TIME OF YEAR AND WHERE YOU ARE LOCATED ON THE PLANET BUT FACING THE SUN AROUND SUN SET YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO SEE THE SUN CROSS DOWN BELOW THE HORIZON BUT FACING THE SUN AROUND THAT TIME FOR ANYWHERE FROM FIVE TO TEN MINUTES OR EVEN LESS EVEN TWO TO FIVE MINUTES CAN ADJUST THE SENSITIVITY OF NURONS IN YOUR RATINA THAT COMMUNICATE LIGHT INFORMATION TO THE BRAIN AND MAKE IT SUCH THAT IN THE EVENING WHEN YOU USE ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS THEY AREN'T GOING TO HAVE AS MUCH OF A DENT FORMENTAL EFFECT ON YOUR DOPOMIN SYSTEM AND FOR IMPAIRING YOUR SLEEP CA SO THE IDEAS AS MUCH BRIGHT LIGHT IDEALLY FROM SUNLIGHT BUT ALSO FROM ARTIFICIAL SOURCES FROM THE TIME YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING UNTIL THE EVENING MAY BE ROUND SIX OR SEVEN O'CLOCK MAY BE IN THE SUMMER MONTHSYLOBIT LATER AND THEN REALLY TRY AND GET AS LITTLE BRIGHT LIGHT IN YOUR EYES AS YOU CAN IN THE EVENING AND NIGHT TIME HOURS END IDEAL YOU WOULD ALSO GET SOME SUNLIGHT EXPOSURE RIGHT AROUND THE TIME OF SUNSET OR IN THE LATE AFTERNOON GO OUTSIDE TAKE YOUR SUN GLASSES OFF DON'T TRY AND DO THIS THROUGH A WINSHIELD OR THROUGH WINDOW IT WILL NOT WORK YOU HAVE TO GET OUTSIDE YOU'RE UNDER AN OVERHANG AT LEAST TRY AND GET SOME DIRECT SUNLIGHT I YOUR EYES AT THAT TIME AND THAT WILL ADJUST THE SENSITIVITY OF YOUR RETNA SUCH THAT BRIGHT ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS OR ARTIFICIAL LIGHTS OF ANY KIND THAT YOUR EXPOSED TO IN THE EVENING AND IN THE LATE HOURS OF THE NIGHT WON'T HAVE AS MUCH OF A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT THAT SAID IF YOU GO TO THE BATHROM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT TRY AND KEEP THE LIGHT'S DIM MANY PEOPLE OF ASKE WHETHER NOT FOR INSTANCE A NIGHT LIGHT OR A FLASH LIGHT IS GOING TO HAVE IT AS MUCH OF AE NEGATIVE EFFECT THIS IS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IF YOU SHINE A LIGHT AT SOMETHING YOU CAN SEE INS YOUR ENVIRONMENT IF YOU EVER BEEN CAMPING YOU'VE WALKED WITH AE FLASHLIGHT YOU CAN SEE THINGS AROUND YOU THAT YOU WOULDN'T OTHERWISE OF COURSE BUT IF YOU WERE TO SHINE THAT LIGHT IN YOUR EYES IT WOULD BE FAR BRIGHTER SO YES OF COURSE IF YOU GET UP IN THEMILL THE NIGHT AND YOU CAN USE YOUR PHONE FLASH LIGHT TO ILLUMINATE THE ENVIRONMENT THAT YOUR IN SO YU CAN SAFELY GO TO WHERE YOU NEED TO GO AND THEN BACK TO BED THAT'S GOING TO BE FAR BETTER THAN TURNING ON THE LIGHTS OR OF COURSE SHINING LIGHT IN YOUR EYES  SO THE IDEA IS BRIGHT BRIGHT BRIGHT IN THE MORNING INTHROUGHOUT THE DAY AND IS DIM AND DARK IS POSSIBLE AT NIGHT AND THAT AFTERNOON LIGHT VIEWING PROVIDE SORT OF WHAT I CALL A NETFLIX AND NOCULATION THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO ADJUST YOURETINAL SENSITIVITY AND GIVE YOU A LITTLE MIT MORE FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF ALLOWING SOME NIGHT TIME LIGHT EXPOSURE WITHOUT THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS NOW I REALIZE TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ABOUT HAPPINESS IT'S NOT ABOUT SUNLIGHT OR DOPAMINE AND YET AS WI'LL TALK ABOUT MORE IN JUST A MOMENT IF YOU'RE NOT OPTIMIZING YOUR SLEEP AND IF YOU ARE USING OR BEING EXPOSED TO LIGHT RATHER AT THE WRONG TIMES OF THE DAYNIGHT CYCLE THAT IS GOING TO MAKE IT VERY HARD FOR THE OTHER SORTS OF PRACTICES THAT RELATE TO HAPPINESS TO HAVE THEIR FULL IMPACT SO THE BACK DROP OR I WOULD SAY THE KIND OF LANDSCAPE OF YOUR CHEMICOLS AND YOUR HORMONES IS POWERFULLY CONTROLLED BY NOT JUST THE BRIGHTNESS OF LIGHT BUT THE TIMING OF LIGHT AND YOURE EXPOSURE TO LIGHT IN PARTICULAR YOUR EXPOSURE TO LIGHT YOUR EYES IS SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE A LOT OF CONTROL OVER YOU DON'T HAVE ABSOLUTE CONTROL BUT YOU HAVE A LOT OF CONTROL OVER AND IT'S BEEN PROVING THAT EVEN THESE SMALL STEPS WHICH ARE COMPLETELY COST FREE THEY REQUIRE JUST A FEW MINUTES OF TIME BUT NO PURCHASE OF PRODUCT OR ANYTHING ELSE CAN ALLOW YOU TO GREATLY ADJUST YOUR NERROW CHEMISTRY AND YOUR HORMONES IN THE DIRECTION OF BETTER MOOD BETTER SLEEP AND HAPPINESS BEFORE WE BEGIN I LIGKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING AN RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTIC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTROLIGHT DRINK WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS PLENTY OF SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM THE SO CALLED ELECTROLIGHTS AND NO SUGAR NOW SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE SELLS IN YOUR BODY IN PARTICULAR TO THE FUNCTION OF YOUR NERVE CELLS ALSO CALLED NURONS IN FACT IN ORDER FOR YOUR NURONS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY ALL THREE ELECTROLIGHTS NEED TO BE PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOS AND WE NOW KNOW THAT EVEN SLIGHT REDUCTION IN ELECTROLIKE CONCENTRATIONS OR DEHYDRATION OF THE BODY CAN LEAD TO DEPHISITES IND COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE ELEMENT CONTAINS A SCIENCE BACK TO ELECTOR ELIKE RATIO OF ONE THOUSAND MELIGRAMS THAT'S ONE GRAHAM OF SODIUM TWO HUNDRED MELEGRAMS OF POTASSIUM AND SIXTY MILIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM I TYPICALLY DRINK ELEMENT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP IN ORDER TO HYDRATE MY BODY AND MAKE SURE I HAVE ENOUGH ELECTROLITES AND WHILE I DO ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL TRAINING AND AFTER PHYSICAL TRAINING AS WELL ESPECIALLY IF I'VE BEEN SWEATING LOT IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMENTE DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE AGAIN THAT'S DRINK ELEMENT EL EMENTE DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN LET'S TALK ABOUT HAPPINESS THIS THING THAT EVERYBODY SEEMS TO WANT AND YET NOT EVERYBODY CAN AGREE UPON WHAT EXACTLY IT IS OR HOW TO GET IT NOW I WANT TO START BY QUOTING A PREVIOUS GUEST ON THE HUBERMAN LAD PODCAST AND THAT IS A COLLEAGUE OF MINE AT STAMPORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE DOCTOR CARL DICEROTH WHO'S BOTH A BIO ENGINEER AND A CLENITION THAT IS HE'S A PCYCHIATRIST WHO SPENDS A LOT OF HIS TIME BOTH RUNNING A LABORATORY AND SEEM PATIENCE HUMAN PATIENCE OF COURSE AND I ONCE WAS AT A MEETING WHERE I HEARD CARL SAY SOMETHING TO THE EXTENT OF WE DON'T KNOW WHAT OTHER PEOPLE FEEL IN FACT MOST OF THE TIME WE DON'T EVEN REALLY KNOW HOW WE FEEL AND WHILE THAT STATEMENT WAS MEANT TO REPORT SEVERAL DIFFERENT THINGS ABOUT THE WAY THAT THE BRAIN WORKS IN A MOTIONS ET CETERA ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HE WAS EMPHASIZING AND I KNOW HE WAS EMPHASIZING IT CAUSE HE CONFIRM THIS FOR ME WAS THE FACT THAT LANGUAGE THINGS LIKE THE WORD HAPPINESS OR JOY OR MEANING OR PLEASURE OR DELIGHT ARE ACTUALLY NOT VERY PRECISE WHEN IT COMES TO DESCRIBING OUR BRAIN AND BODY STATES SO FOR INSTANCE IF I TELL YOU I'M FEELING PRETTY HAPPY I KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS FOR ME AT LEAST IN THIS MOMENT BUT YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHETHER NOT IT MEANS THE SAME THING AS WHAT PRETTY HAPPY MEANS FOR YOU IF I SAY IAM EXTREMELY HAPPY AND I'VE A BIG GRIN I'VE A GRIN ON MY FACE THAT CAN EM TO WIPE OFF MY FACE WELL THEN YOU MIGHT GET A SENSE OF HOW MUCH HAPPIER I AM THEN PRETTY HAPPY BUT IT'S STILL HARD TO CALIBRATE MY LEVEL OF INTERNAL STATE OR HAPPINESS AND THE SAME IS TRUE FOR YOU AND FOR EVERYBODY ELSE AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS BECAUSE AT THIS POINT IN HUMAN HISTORY TWENTY TWENTY TWO WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A MEASUREMENT LIKE BODY TEMPERATURE OR HEARTRADED OR HEARTRATE VERYABILITY OR EVEN A WAY TO MEASURE NOR  CHEMICALS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT GIVE US ANYTHING BETTER THAN A CRUDE CORELIT OR AN ESTIMATE AT BEST OF WHAT HAPPINESS IS SO THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND IN TO KEEP IN MIND THROUGHOUT THIS EPISODE IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CANNOT HAVE A STRONG DATA DRIVEN CONVERSATION ABOUT HAPPINESS AND WHAT BRINGS US TO A STATE OF HAPPINSS BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTA D UNDERSTAND THAT LANGUAGE IS NOT AN IDEAL AND MAY BE EVEN A DEFICIENT TOOL IN TERMS OF DESCRIBING OUR EMOTIONS AND OUR STATES OF MIND AND BODY NOW EQUALLY IMPORTANT IS TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHILE WE DO HAVE NEURO TRANSMITTERS THAT IS THE CHEMICALS THAT ARE RELEASED BETWEEN NURONS NERVE CELLS THAT ALLOW NEURONS TO COMMUNICATE THINGS LIKE GLUDOMATE AND GABA FOR INSTANCE AND WE HAVE WHAT ARE CALLED NEURO MODULATORS THESE ARE CHEMICALS ALSO RELEASED BY NURONS THAT IMPACT THE ELECTRICAL FIRING AND CHEMICAL RELEASE OF OTHER NURONS THINGS LIKE CERATONIN AND DOPOMINE AND A SEETO COLINE AND EPINEPERAN NEUROMODULATORS AND NEUROTRANSMITTERS ARE ALWAYS PRESENT IN A COCKTAIL IN OUR BRAIN AND BODY THAT IS THEY ARE PRESENT IN DIFFERENT RATIOS IN AT DIFFERENT LEVELS SO WE NEED TO COMPLETELY DISCARD WITH THE IDEA THAT ANY ONE NEURO TRANSMITTER OR ANY ONE NEUROMODULATOR IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR A STATE OF HAPPINESS OR FOR ELACK OF STATE OF HAPPINESS FOR THAT MATTER THAT SAID IT IS TRUE THAT FOR PEOPLE THAT TEND TO HAVE LOWER BASE LINE LEVELS OF FOR INSTANCE DOPOMINE THEIRE LEVELS OF HAPPINESS ERE WE SHOULD SAY THEIR SELF REPORTED LEVELS OF HAPPINESS TEND TO BE LOWER THEN FOR THOSE THAT HAVE GREATLY ELEVAT A BASELINE LEVELS OF DOPOMINE NOW THIS CAN BE BEST APPRECIATED AT THE EXTREMES WHERE FOR INSTANCE IN CONDITIONS LIKE PARKINSON'S DISEASE WERE OTHER CONDITIONS WHERE PEOPLES LEVELS OF DOPOMING IN THEIR BRAIN IS SEVERELY DEPLETED MIND YOU WE ALSO SEE THIS IN DRUG ADDICTED INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE IN A WITHDRAWAL STATE BECAUSE THEYRE TRYING TO QUIT OR THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE DRUG THAT NORMALLY STIMULATES RELEASES OF DOPOMINE THINK THE COCANEATTIC WHO CAN'T GET COCANE OR THE METHEMPHETEMINE ATTIC THAT CAN'T OR IS TRYING TO AVOID TAKING METHEMPHEDEMIE WHERE THE PARKANSENS PATIENT WHO HAS FEWER DOPOMIG NURONS BECAUSE THEY DEGENERATED THOSE INDIVIDUALS DO TEND TO BE MORE DEPRESSED THEY TEND HAVE LOWER AFFECT THEY ARE LESS HAPPY AT LEAST THAT'S HOW THEY REPORT THEMSELVES TO BE EMOTIONALLY AND THAT'S WHAT WE OBSERVE WHEN WE LOOK THEM BEHAVIORLY IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF SMILING THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY THEY SEEM TO HAVE  THE OPPOSITE EXTREME AND WHILE STILL FOCUSING ON THE KIND OF PATHOLOGY OF NEURO TRANSMITTER N NURMODULATOR SYSTEMS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS IN A MANIC PHASE OF BY POLERD WILL TEND TO HAVE VERY ELEVATED LEVELS OF DOPOMIN AND THOSE PEOPLE TALK A MILE A MINUTE AND THEY WON'T REQUIRE SLEEP AND AT LEAST TO THEM EVERY IDEAS AND EXCITING IDEA AND ONE THAT THEY WANT TO PURSUE WE DIDN'T ENTIRE EPISODE ABOUT BY POLER DEPRESSION ECA BY POLAR DISORDER SO YOU LIKE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THAT PLEASE CHECK OUT THAT EPISODE THAT AN ALL OTHER EPISODES OF THE PODCASS OF COURSE YOU CONFINE AT HUBERMAN LAVDOT CALM AND ALL FORMATS BUT THE POINT HERE IS THAT VERY LOW LEVELS ARE VERY HIGH LEVELS OF DOPOMINE ARE CORRELATED WITH CERTAIN STATES OF FOR INSTANCE LO O HAPPINESS OR THE ABSENCE OF HAPPINESS WE COUN EVEN CALL DEPRESSION IN SOME CASES OR EXTREME HAPPINESS OR EVEN EUPHORIA SOMETIMES EVEN INAPPROPRIATE EUPHORIA AS IS THE CASE WITH BY POLAR DEPRESSION ORS IS SOMEKID SOMETIMES CALLED BY POLAR MANIA OR BY PLAR DISORDER OF COURSE RIS ARRANGE IN BETWEEN DEPRESSED AND MANIC AND MOST PEOPL FORTUNATELY RESIDE SOMEWHERE IN THAT RANGE AND IT IS INDEED A CONTINUUM AND I THINK IT SAFE TO SAY THET LEVELS OF DOPOMINE PROBABLY DO CORRELATE WITH LEVELS OF HAPPINESS BUT THERE IS NO ONE SINGLE CHEMICAL NOR CHEMICAL SIGNATURE THAT IS NOS PECIFIC RECIPE OF TWO PARTS DOPOMN TO ONE PART SERATONANTO ONE PART A SINTL COLINE THAT WE CAN SAY EQUATES TO HAPPINESS INDEED THERE IS NOW TREMENDOUS CONTROVERSY AS TO WHAT ITHER NOT FOR INSTANCE HAVING LOWER LEVELS OF SERATONAN IS ACTUALLY THE CAUSE OF DEPRESSION OR MERELY CORRELATES WITH DEPRESSION OR MAYBE DOES EVEN CORRELATE WITH DEPRESSION AT ALL THIS BECAME ESPECIALLY CONTROVERSIOAL BECAUSE IN THE LAST YEAR SO CALED CERATONAN HYPOTHESIS OF DEPRESSION HAS BEEN CALLED INTOQUESSION AND INDEED IT DOES SEEM TO BE THE CASE THAT FOR INDIVIDUALS THERE DEPRESSE THERE LEVELS OF CERATONIAN CAN SOMETIMES BE NORMAL HOWEVER AND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT HOWEVER THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT ADMINISTERING DRUGS THAT INCREASE LEVELS OF SERATONAN IN DEPRESS PEOPLE DOES NOT SOMETIMES AND INDEED OFTEN HELP AMELIERATE SOME OF THEIR SYMPTOMS NI SHOUL MENTION THAT MANY OF THE SELECTIVE ERATONAN REUPTAKEN HIBITER SO CALLED ESSESS AREYES SUCH AS PROSAC AND ZOL OFTITS ET CETERA ARE STILL CONSIDERED EXCELLENT TREATMENTS FOR CONDITIONS LIKE O C D AND SO ON AND SO FORTH BUT WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO AS MAKE TOO IMPORTANT POINTS FIRST OF ALL THAT LANGUAGE IS NOT A GREAT INDICATOR OF INTERNAL STATE ESPECIALLY WHEN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND OTHER PEOPLES INTERNAL STATE AND THAT IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR THINGS LIKE HAPPINESS AND THAT THERE IS NO ONE CHEMICAL SIGNATURE OF HAPPINESS THERE IS NO ONE NEUROMODULATOR OR COMMINATIONS OF NEROMODULATORS THAT WE CAN SAY IS THE COCKTAL FOR HAPPINESS BUT AND IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT BUT WHEN LEVELS OF DOPOMINE AND SERATONAN TEND TO BE CHRONICALLY LOW FOR AN INDIVIDUAL BELOW THEIR TYPICAL BASE LINE THEY WILL YES TEND TO BE LOWER IN AFFECT AND HAVE LOWER MOOD AND LESS EPISODES OF HAPPINESS PER DAY PER WEEK PERMONTH PER YEAR ET CETERA CONVERSELY WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL HAS ELEVATIONS IN DOPOMINE IN SERATONAN LEVELS IN PARTICULAR DOPOMINE LEVELS AND THE OTHER SO CALL CATACOLAMINES WHICH INCLUDE EPINEFRON AN NORAPINEFRON SO THE CATICOMINES AR DOPOMINE EPINEFRON AND NORIPINEFRON THERE LL VERY SIMILAR BYACHEMICALLY THEY ALL LEAD TO STATES OF ELEVATED MOTIVATION ENERGY AND SO ON WHEN THOSE CHEMICALS ARE ELEVATED ABOVE BASE LINE PEOPLE DO TEND TO HAVE ELEVATED SENSE OF MOOD AND WELL BEING AND IN PARTICULAR SENSE OF POSSIBILITY ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN DO IN THE WORLD ND WHAT THE WORLD CAN OFFER THEM O WE EANTO ACKNOWLEDGE THOSE TWO FEATURES OF LANGUAGE AND NOR CHEMISTRY AS WE WEIGHED INTO THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE PSYCHOLOGY OF HAPPINESS AND IN PARTICULAR ABOUT THE CONTROLLED EXPERIMENTS THAT'VE BEEN DONE IN EXCELLENT LABORATORIES FOCUSSED ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF HAPPINESS AND WHAT BRINGS HAPPINESS AND WHAT DOES NOT THEREVE BEEN SOME EXCELLENT STUDIES ON HAPPINESS AND THESE COME IN TWO FORMS GENERALLY ONE FORM OF THESE STUDIES IS INDIVIDUALS COME INTO A LABORATORY THEY PARTICIPATE IN AN EXPERIMENT OVER THE COURSE OF A DAY OR MONTHS AND THEN DATE ARE COLLECTED ANALYZED AND THE PAPERS ARE SUBMITTED AND PUBLISHED AND DISCUSSED THE OTHER FORM IS SO CA LONGITUDINAL STUDY WERE INDIVIDUALS COME INTO THE LABORATORY AND THEY ARE STUDIED OVER A VERY LONG PERIOD OF TIME RANGING FROM MONTHS TO YEARS AND SOMETIMES EVEN DECADES AND THEN THE VARIABLES OF AGE LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES AND OTHER FACTORS CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO THE DATA AND TYPICALLY THERE ARE MULTIPLE PAPERS S DATA PUBLISHED THROUGHOUT THE LONGITUDINAL STUDY OR SOMETIMES ITS JUST ONE PAPER T THE END OF THE LONGITUDINAL STUDY LET'S TALK ABOUT ONE OF THE MORE FAMOUS AND PERHAPS THE LONGEST RUNNING LONGITUDINAL STUDY ON HAPPINESS THIS IS A STUDY THAT WAS INITIATED WERE CONCEIVED IN NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY THE SO CALLED HARVARD HAPPINESS PROJECT SOME OF YOU PROBABLY HEARD ABOUT THIS IT INVOLVED HARVARD CALLEGE SOPHOMORS AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS WERE INCORPORATED IN THIS STUDY AS WELL IT'S A STUDYH THAT INITIALLY HAD MORE THAN A COUPLE OF HUNDRED SUBJECTS BUT BECAUSE SOME HAVE EITHER DROPPED OUT AND NOT BEEN ABLE TO BE CONTACTED AND MONDERED OVER TIME OR DIED OR FOR WHATEVER REASON ARE NO LONGER PARTICIPATING IN THE STUDY THER VERY FEW OF THESE INDIVIDUALS LEFT AND YET THERE'S TREMENDOUS POWER TO A STUDY LIKE THIS IS SUCH AN IMPRESSIVE STUDY AND WERE ALLSO GRATEFUL THAT AND LABORATORIES AT HARVARD DECIDED TO INITIATE AND CONTINUE THE STUDY BECAUSE IT IS ONE OF THE FEW STUDIES PERHAPS THESE STUDY THAT IS ALLOWED US TO UNDERSTAND HAPPINESS IN OUR SPECIES OVER A VERY LONG PERIOD OF TIME LIKE ANY STUDY IT'S NOT PERFECT IT ID INCLUDE A LOT OF UN MATCHING BY SEC OR MATCHING BY VOCATION OR MATCHING BY INCOME IND BACKGROUND AND BACK THEN THERE WAS ALSO A LOTLESS TO SCUSSION ABOUT TRMA AND HISTORIES AROUND TRAMA AS WELL AS POSIVE EPISODES AND PEOPLE'S LIVES NONE THE LESS THERE'S A LOT OF POWER IN A STUDY LIKE THIS AND THERE'S SOME VERY BASIC TAKE AWAYS SOME OF WHICH YOU MAY HAVE HEARD BEFORE BUT SOME OF WHICH MAY BE SURPRISING THOSE OF YOU WHO HAPPENT SO ONE OF THE KEY THINGS ABOUT THE STUDY IS PEOPLE IN THE STUDY LEAST THOSE WHO STILL HAVE INTACKED MEMORY WHICH MANY OF THEM DO ARE ABLE TO THINK BACK ON NOT JUST THEIR PREVIOUS YEAR OR WEAK BUT TEN YEARS AGO TWENTY YEARS AGO FIFTY YEARS AGO AND COMPARE WHAT MAKES THEM HAPPY AT ONE AGE VERSES ANOTHER AGE A NUMBER OF THINGS HAVE EMERGED FROM THAT CONVERSATION SO I JUST WANT TO DISCUSS SOME OF THAT HIGH LIGHT POINTS THEN WI'LL GET INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THE KNITTY GREEDY OF THE DATA FIRST OF ALL IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED MANY MANY TIMES THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF INCOME THAT AN INDIVIDUAL MAKES OR HAS AND AGAIN THIS COULD BE INCOME FROM WORK OR IT COULD BE MONEY THAT THEY INHERITET DOES NOT SEEM TO DIRECTLY RELATE TO THEIR LEVEL OF HAPPINESS NOW A LOT OF PEOPLE TAKE THAT POINT AND THINK AH MONEY DOESN'T MATTER OTHER PEOPLE HEAR THAT POINT AND THINK TO THEMSELVES YE ARE RIGHT EASY TO SAY IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF MONEY WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE INTERPRETATION OF THOSE DATA IN JUST A FEW MINUTES BUT I DO ONE A EURE MARK THAT FINDING BECAUSE I AGREE THAT WELL MONEY OR TOTAL RESOURCES ITSELF DOES NOT PREDICT HAPPINESS IN ANY KIND OF DIRECT WAY THAT IS NOT THE SAME THING AS SAYING HAVING VERY FEW RESOURCES WILL MAKE YOU HAPPIER OF COURSE I DON'T THINK ANY ONE WOULD IMAGINE THAT BUT IT ALSO TENDS TO OVERLOOK AN IMPORTANT POINT WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT I CERTAINLY HAVE LEARNED TO APPRECIATE IN MY LIFE AND SOMETHING THAT I ESPECIALLY APPRECIATE WHEN I WAS A STUDENT AND POST STOC WHICH IS THE FOLLOWING PEOPLE WILL SAY MONEY CAN'T BUY HAPPINESS AND WILL TALK ABOUT THE BUY ASPECT OF THAT IN A MOMENT AND INDEED THAT'S TRUE IF YOU LOOK AT THIS LONGITUNERAL STUDY OR YOU LOOK AT OTHER STUDIES THEY ARE DONE ON A MORE SHORT TERM BASIS ONCE PEOPLE GET PASS A CERTAIN LEVEL OF INCOME RELATIVE TO THEIR COST OF LIVING THE AMOUNT OF HAPPINESS DOES NOT SCALE WITH THAT INCOME THAT IS FOR EVERY ADDITIONAL THOUSAND DOLLARS OR TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT THEY EARN THEY DON'T REPORT BEING THAT MUCH HAPPIER ON A DAILY BASIS NOW THAT'S SAID IVENTURE THE ARGUMENT THAT WHILE MONEY TRULY CANNOT BUY HAPPINESS IT ABSOLUTELY CAN BUFFER STRESS AND IN PARTICULAR IT CAN BUFF FOR STRESS IN THE FORM OF THE ABILITY TO PURCHASE OR PAY FOR GOODS AND SERVICES AND IN PARTICULAR SERVICES YOU'RE NOT CAN TO TELL ME THAT HAVING CHILDREN DOESN'T INVOLVE SOME INCREASE IN THE DEMANDS ON YOUR LIFE LESS SLEEP AND MORE DEMANDS AND IT CERTAINLY IS THE CASE THAT IF YOU CAN HIRE HELP TO CLEAN YOU CAN HIRE NANNIES IF THAT'S YOUR YOUR THING YOU CAN HIRE HELP TO ASSIST WITH BABY SITTING OR EVEN NIGHT NURSES IF YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE SLEEPING THAT WILL LAT LITERALLY ALLOW YOU TO SLEEP WHILE THEY TAKE CARE OF YOUR CHILD THAN E MILL THE NIGHT OFTEN GIVE EXCELLENT CARE ONE HOPES EXCELLENT CARE THAT THAT WON'T OFFSET SOME OF THE STRESS ASSOCIATE WITH LACK OF SLEEP SO THEY'RE MILLING DIFFERENT EXAMPLES ONE COULD GIVE OF THIS BUT I CERTAINLY EXPERIENCE THIS DURING GRADUATE SCHOL IN FACT I EXPERIENCE BOTH SIDES OF THE EQUATION HERE I MADE VERY LITTLE MONEY AS A GRADUATE STUDENT I HAD ESSENTIALLY NO SAVINGS WHEN I START GRADUATE SCHOON I MADE VERY LITTLE MONEY THE AMOUNT DOESN'T MATTER AT THIS POINT BUT I COULD JUST BARELY AFFORD RENT IN MY FOOD I SHAULL OPTED TO LIVE IN THE L ABORATORY LOT OF THE TIME AND BY DOING THAT I HAD MORE MONEY TO SPEND ON OTHER THINGS THAT WERE IMPORTANT TO ME NOW I DID NOT HAVE A FAMILY AT THE TIME AND SO I WAS ABLE TO DO THAT SOMETHING THAT NOT EVERYONE CAN DO BUT I MADE VERY LITTLE MONEY BUT AT THE SAME TIME I WAS IN LABORATORY ALL THE TIME AND THAT'S WHERE I WANTED TO BE AND SO MY LEVEL OF STRESS WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY LOW BECAUSE I WAS INVESTING ALL MY TIME AND ENERGY INTO THE VERY THING THAT I KNEW WOULD EVENTUALLY HELP BRING ME MORE RESOURCES WHEN I MOVED FROM BEING A GRADUATE STDENT TO A POSTOC FOR INSTANCE A POSTOC IS A GENERALLY OF THREE TO FIVE YEAR PERIOD SO LIKE RESINSEE AND METMEDICINE WHERE YOU'RE NO LONGER TAKING COURSES BUT YOU CONTINUED TO DO RESEARCH IN FACT ENTIRE NEW LINES OF RESEARCH AND PRIOR TO GETTIN A PROFESSORSHIP MY INCOME WENT UP SLIGHTLY WENT UP BY ABOUT THIRTY TO FORTY PER CENT BUT BECAUSE OF WHERE I MOVED AND BECAUSE OF THE TIMES MY COST OF LIVING WENT WAYWAY UP AND I WAS EXTREMELY STREST SO IT WAS IN MY ABSOLUTE INCOME IT WAS MY ABSOLUTE INCOME RELATIVE TO MY COST OF LIVING THE OTHER THING THAT ONE NEEDS TO CONSIDER WHEN CONSIDERING INCOME VERSES COST OF LIVING IS THERE'S ALSO THIS NOTION OF PURE GROUP AND WERE GOING TO TALK MORE ABOUT SOCIAL BONDS AND CONNECTIONS LATER ONE THING THA I NOTICED WHEN I MOVED FROM BEING A GRADUATE STUDENT TO A POSTOCK WAS I WAS A GRADUATE STUDENT IN A SMALL TOWN WHERE I HAD ACCESS IF I CHOSE TO PARTICIPATE IN MOST IF NOT ALL OF THE SOCIAL GATHERINGS BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL VERY LOW COST PEOPLE TENDED TO AGGREGATE AT THE FARMERS MARKET ON SATURDAY MOST PEOPLE AN EVEN PURCHASE ANYTHING AT LEAST NOT THE THE GRADUATE STUDENTS WHEN PURCHASINYTHING IT WAS JUST A PLACE TO AGGREGATE PEOPLE SOMETIMES PLAY PICK UP GAMES OF SOCKER OR JUST HANG OUT HAVE A CUP OF COFFEE THERE WAS A VOLUBLE GAME ON FRIDAYS SOMETIMES PEOPLE WOULD GO OUT TO EAT THAT EVENING WHICH OF COURSE COST MONEY ET CETERA BUT IT WAS RELATIVELY LOW COST OF LIVING AND SOCIAL CONNECTIONS AND PURE GROUP INTERACTIONS WE'RE ALL GENERATED AROUND THE SAME FAIRLY LOW COST ACTIVITIES WHEN I TRANSITION TO BEING A POSTOC I MADE MORE MONEY BUT COST OF LIVING WENT UP BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT MY PURE GROUP TENDED TO WANT IT ENGAGE IN THE SAME KINDS OF ACTIVITIES THAT PEOPLE IN THAT LARGER CITY WERE ENGAGED IT SO PURE GROUP HAS A TREMENDOUSLY POWERFUL INFLUENCE ON WHETHER R NOT WE GAGE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE HAVE AS BRINGING US HAPPINESS OR NOT AND THAT REALLY SPEAKS TO THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AND CERTAIN KINDS OF SOCIAL INTERCTIONS IN PARTICULAR IF ANY OF THAT WAS UNCLEAR WHAT I'M BASICALLY SAYING IS IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT BEING ABLE TO PAY YOUR RENT IT'S ALSO ABOUT BEING ABLE TO ACCESS THE KINDS OF SOCIAL INTERACTIONS THAT YOU DEEM ARE QUOTN QUOTE CORRECT FOR YOU AT THAT STAGE OF LIFE AND IN THE PLACE WHERE YOU HAPPEN TO BE LIVING BECAUSE IF YOU CAN MEET ALL THE DEMANDS OF COSTS OF OF RENT AND PAYING YOUR POWER BILL AND FOOD ET CETERA BUT YOU ARE SOCIALLY ISOLATED BECAUSE YOUR PURE GROUP WERE THOSE AROUND YOU THAT YOU WANT TO ENGAGE WITH ARE ENGAGING IN ACTIVITIES THAT YOU EITHER DON'T HAVE KINE FOR LITERALLY BECAUSE YOUARE DOING OTHER THINGS OR THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES FOR THEN THAT CAN ACTUALLY SEVERELY IMPACT THIS RATING OF WHAT WE CALL HAPPINESS WHY AM I PARSING THIS SO FINALLY ONE PARSILY IN FINALLY BECAUSE I THINK THAT MOST OF US HAVE HEARD THE OUTCOME OF THIS STUDY FROM HARVARD OR THE MORE SHORT TERM STUDIES ALSO MANY OF WHICH ARE FROM HARVARD WILL TALK ABOUT THE JUST PHENOMENAL WORK FROM DAN GILBERT'S LABORATORY AN OTHER LABORATORIES WHO FOCUSED ON ISSUES LIKE THESE AND I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM THOSE RESULTS THE'RE VERY POWERFUL AND IMPORTANT RESULTS THERE REALLY POINT OVER AND OVER TO THE FACT THAT PEOPLE'S HAPPINESS DOES NOT NECESSARILY SCALE WITH INCOME IN FACT IT TENDS NOT TO PASS A CERTAIN LEVEL AND YET I THINK WED BE REMISS I THINK ACTUALLY WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE FOR ME TO SAY THAT THE AMOUNT OF INCOME THAT ONE MAKES IS NOT IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IF THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE OR ARE MAKING DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO MEET YOUR BASIC NEEDS OF SHELTER HEALTH CARE ET CETERA AND OR DOESN'T ALLOW YOU TO ACESS THE KIND OF SOCIAL INTERACTIONS THAT CAN RENEW AND RESET OR I WOULD SAY DIRECTLY ENHANCE THE KIND OF NOR TRANSMITTER SYSTEMS AND HORMONES THAT LEAD US TO FEEL THAT WE ARE HAPPY IN OUR LIFE AND WERE HAVING QUALITY SOCIAL CONNECTIONS WELL THEN THAT'S VERY STRESSFUL AND THIS BRINGS ME BACK TO THE STATEMENT I MADE EARLIER WHICH IS INDEED MONEY CANNOT BUY HAPPINESS BUT IT CERTAINLY CAN BUFFOR STRESS AND ONE OF THE WAYS THAT IT BUF FOR STRESS IS BY ALLOWING OPTIONS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF SOCIAL INTERACTIONS OPTIONS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF RECREATION THAT ONE CAN ENGAGE INTO ACCESS NEW FORMS OF SOCIAL INTERACTION AND SO ON AND SO ON SO WE NED TO BE A LITTLE BIT CAREFUL OR AT LEAST NEW WANTS ABOUT THE STATEMENT THAT MONEY CAN'T BUY HAPPINESS AND THAT THE DAY TO SUPPORT THE FACT THAT WEALTH DOESN'T DETERMINE HAPPINESS I THINK THERE IS A TRUTH TO THAT BUT THERE'S ANOTHER SIDE TO THAT THAT I THINK IS LESS OFTEN ACKNOWLEDGED AND THAT I'M CERTAINLY I'VE EXPERIENCED AND THAT I THINK MANY OF YOU OUT THERE PROBABLY EXPERIENCE AS WELL ONE OTHER MAJOR FINDING OF THE HARVARD LONGITUDINAL STUDY ON HAPPINESS AS WELL AS SHORTER TERM STUDIES ON HAPPINESS IS THAT MUCH AS YOU'VE HEARD PERHAPS THAT NO ONE ON THEIR DEATH BED SAYS THEY WISH THEY AD WORKED MORE WELL INDEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF TIME THAT ONE SPENDS WORKING DOES NOT SEEM TO DETERMINE ONE'S HAPPINESS AND YET I ALSO WANT TO YOUREMARK THAT RESULT AS ONE THAT WE NEEDS A PARSE A BIT MORE CAREFULLY BECAUSE WORK LAST TIME I CHECKED AND CERTAINLY FOR ME IS THE WAY TYPICALLY THAT PEOPLE EARN AN INCOME AND AS WE JUST TALKED ABOUT A MOMENT AGO INCOME IS OFTEN AWAY THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO ERE PROVIDE ACCESS FOR THEIR FAMILY TO THINGS LIKE RECREATION THAT OPENS UP THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE SOCIAL CONNECTION MIGHT SO THEY WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WITH HOW WE INTERPRET THESE BLANKE STATEMENTS THAT HAVE BECOME VERY POPULAR THAT YOU MONEY DOESN'T DETERMINE HAPPINESS AND THAT THE AMOUNT THAT YOU WORK IS IN GOING TO DETERMINE HAPPINESS IT CERTAINLY IS THE CASE THAT IF YOU EARN MORE MONEY FROM WORKING MORE AND THAT MONEY IS DEVOTED TO THINGS THAT BRING MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR SOCIAL CONNECTION OR FOR BUFFERING STRESS AND OTHER AREAS OF YOUR LIFE INCLUDING HEALTH CARE I CARE FOR YOUR CHILDREN CARE FOR YOURSELF RECREATION OTHER THINGS THAT YOU ENJOY FOR THEN I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT NAIVE TO ASSUME THAT WORK ITSELF IS SOMEHOW COUNTER TO HAPPINESS WHICH OF COURSE IT ISN'T AND IT ESPECIALLY ISN'T IF WE COMBINE THAT FEATURE OF WORK WITH ANOTHER IMPORTANT FEATURE OF THE HUMAN PSYCHE WHICH IS THIS NOTION OF MEANING NOW IN THE NOT YOU DISTRIM FUTURE WE WILL DO AN EPISODE OF THIS PODCAST ON MEANING AND WHAT CONSTITUTES MEANING IN A GIVEN ENDEAVOR WORK OR OTHERWISE BUT MUCH OF THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE LAST CENTURY AND STILL TO DAY FOCASES ON THIS FEATURE OF MEANING AS A CRITICAL ONE IN TERMS OF WHAT MAKES US HAPPY IN WHAT DOESN'T MAKE US HAPPY CERTAINLY IN THE LONG TERM AND I CAN CERTAINLY SAY FOR MYSELF THAT LEARNING AND TEACHING AND DOING RESEARCH IN MY LABORATORY BRINGS ME TREMENDOUS FEELING OF MEANING AND HAPPINESS SOME PEOPLE CONSIDER THEIR WORK SIMPLY AWAY TO GAIN A PETYA CHECK AND OTHER PEOPLE FIND THAT THEY WOULD DO THE VERY WORK THEY DO REGARDLESS OF WHETHER R NOT THEY WERE PAID IN FACT MANY PEOPLE DO VOLUNTEER WORK AND OTHER FORMS OF WORK FOR ZERO MONEY SO THIS IDEA THAT MONEY ISN'T IMPORTANT OR THAT WORK IS NOT AS IMPORTANT AS WE DEEM IT TO BE THAT ALSO NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED FROM A NUMBER DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES AND AGAIND BY NO MEANS IN MY TRYING TO UNDERMINE THE DATA OF THESE IMPRESSIVE STUDIES BOTH THE LONGITUDAL AND SHORT TERM STUDIES BUT THINK WE DO HAVE TO BE CAUTIOUS IN OUR DISCUSSION OF RESULTS LIKE THIES BECAUSE THE INTERNETT IS REPLETE WITH CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE BIG FACTORS THAT DETERMINE HAPPINESS IT'S GOING TO BE SOCIAL CONNECTION NOT INCOME IT'S GOING TO BE A THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO HAVE OPEN THINKING AND CREATIVITY WHICH I THINK IS AN ESSENTIAL FEATURE OF HAPPINESS BY THE WAY PHYSICAL HEALTH IN PARTICULAR ONE'S ABILITY TO STAY MOBILE AND TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE KIND OF DAILY ACTIVITIES THAT ONE NEEDS TO ACCOMPLISH UNASSISTED IS A STRONG CORROLETE OF HAPPINESS AND SO ON AND SO ON AND OF COURSE THERE ARE THE BASIC PHYSIOLOGY FACTORS THE THINGS THAT FEED BACK ON TO OUR OVER ALL FEELINGS OF WELL BEING AND TALKED ABOUT THESE BEFORE AND WILL JUST PUT THESE QUICKLY INTO A BIN A YOU CAN THINK OF THIS AS A AS A TOOL KIT OF THINGS THAT YOU AND EVERY ONE REALLY SHOULD BE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO ACCESS IF NOT OPTIMIZE ON A REGULAR BASIS BECAUSE THEY RAISE THE TIDE OR WHAT I WOULD CALLED THE BUOYANCY OF YOUR OVER ALL SYSTEM MEANING YOUR BRAIN AND BODY AND THAT WOULD BE GETTING SUFFICIENT DEEP SLEEP AT LEAST EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE NIGHTS OF YOUR LIFE AND IDEALLY THE REMAINING TWENTY PER CENT YOU'RE N OCKANG DEEP SLEEP  WE'RE AS MUCH OF IT BECAUSE OF POSITIVE EVENTS QUALITY NUTRITION QUALITY SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AND WEWILL DEFIND THAT ELIBIT BETTER IN FACT WE WILL DEFIND THAT IN A LOT OF DETAIL LATER IN THIS EPISODE AND ACTALLY HOW TO GET BETTER AT CREATING QUALITY SOCIAL INTERACTIONS EVEN VERY BRIEF SOCIAL INTERACTIONS SO WE HAVE SLEEP WE HAVE NUTRITION WE HAVE SOCIAL INTERACTIONS WE HAVE PURPOSEFUL WORK WHETHER OR NOT ITS PAID WORK OR NON PAID WORK AND OF COURSE THERE LIKE EXERCISE AND MAY BE RELATIONSHIPS TO PETS IND THINGS THAT SORT AND THERE ARE FEW OTHERS AS WELL ALL OF THOSE ARE KNOWN TO INCREASE YOU'RE OVER ALL STATE OF WELL BEING THAT PUTS YOU IN A POSITION TO ACCESS MORE MEANING AND HAPPINESS ET CETERA BUT FOR MOST PEOPLE I THING IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT EARNING A LIVING AND EARNING A LIVING BY WORKING IS THE TYPICAL WAY IN WHICH WE SPEND MOST OF OUR TIME SO I THINK WE NEED TO PUT ASPECIAL BRACKET AROUND THOSE ACTIVITIES AND SOMETHING WE'LL RETURN TO A LOMIT LATER AND TERNS OF CHINA UNDERSTAND HOW PERIODS OF LIFE IN WHICH THEIRE OUR BIG OR EXTENSIVE WORK DEMANDS OR EXTENSIVE FAMILY DEMANDS ON US AR INDEED COMPATIBLE WITH STATES OF HAPPINESS OR FREQUENT STATES OF HAPPINESS AND HOW BETTER TO ACCESS THOSE RATHER THAN SIMPLY SAY MONEY ISNI'T IMPORTANT OR THE AMOUNT OF TIME AT WORK REALLY A ISN'T IMPORTANT THAT'S NOT WHAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO PAY ATTENTION TO IN FACT I DON'T KNOW HOW I WILL FEEL MY DEATHBED HOW COULD I AM HUMAN BEINGS ARE PRETTY GOOD ABOUT UNDERSTANDING HOW THEY FEEL IN THE PRESENT IF NOT DESCRIBING IT THEY ARE PRETTY GOOD AT FEELING IT IF THEY HAVE ANY SENSE OF INTERNAL STATE THAT IS INTEROCEPTION GAVE SOME IDEA OF HOW YOU FEEL IN A MOMENT WE'RE PRETTY GOOD ABOUT DESCRIBING OUR PAST FEELINGS AT LEAST IN BROAD CONTOUR BUT WE ARE NOT VERY GOOD AT PROJECTING HOW WE WILL FEEL WHEN THE FUTURE IN FACT THAT'S A THEME THAT'S GOING TO COME UP AGAIN AND AGAIN TO DAY NONE THE LESS WHAT WE DO KNOW ON THE BASIS OF REALLY SOLID DATA OR THAT CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OUR WELL BEING TEND TO CHANGE ACROSS OUR LIFE SPAN NOW LIFE SPAN IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER FROM ALSO A BIT OF NEW AUNTS BECAUSE HUMANS ARE INDEED LIVING LONGER AND LONGER AND IF WE LOOK AT THE DATE ON HAPPINESS ACROSS THE LIFE SPAN DATED MAY BE THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS BACK OR EVEN TWENTY YEARS AGO IT IS CONSISTENTLY DESCRIBED ING THAT LITERATURE AS A SO CALLED YOU SHAPED FUNCTION WHERE PEOPLE IN THEIR TWENTIES REPORT BEING VERY VERY HAPPY BUT AS TIME GOES ON AND THEY ACQUIRE MORE RESPONSIBILITY O TYPICALLY GETTING MARRIED AND HAVING CHILDREN IN THEIRE MID TOLATE TWENTIES AND THIRTIES AND INTO THEIR FORTIES HAVING MORE WORK DEMANDS ET CETERA HAPPINESS IS TEND TO BE RATED LOWER AND LOWER AT LEAST IN THOSE PREVIOUS STUDIES AND THEN HAPPINESS TENDED TO INCREASE AS PEOPLE APPROACH THEIR FIFTIES AND SIXTIES AND THEY TENDED TO RETIRE IN THEIR WORK DEMANDS WE'RE SHED FROM THEM HEN THEY WERE ABLE TO ENJOY THE SMALL THINGS OF LIFE DESPITE THE FACT THAT IN GENERAL I WOULD SAY ALMOST ALWAYS PEOPLE'S HEALTH IS NOT AS VIGOROUS WHEN THEIR SEVENTY AS IT IS WHEN TH WHEN THEIRE TWENTY THEIR EXCEPTIONS THAT OF COURSE BUT AND OF COURSE YOU CAN ADJUST THE RATE OF A COGNATIVE AND PHYSICALE DECLINE BUT IN GENERAL PEOPLE IN THEIR TWENTIES FEEL MORE PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY VIGOROUS THAN THEY DO IN THEIR SUCCEES IN SEVITIES IN GENERAL THAT YOU SHAPED FUNCTION THAT I JUST DESCRIBED STILL HOLDS TRUE TO DAY BUT OF COURSE THERE BEEN SOME MAJOR SHIFTS TO THE GENERAL LIFE STAGES AND WHEN PEOPLE UNDERGO THOSE LIFE STAGES FOR INSTINCE MANY PEOPLE ARE GETTING MARRIED MUCH LATER MANY PEOPLE ARE OPTING TO NOT HAVE CHILDREN I FACT IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA ON WHETHER NOT PEOPLE HAVE CHILDREN OR NOT HOW THAT RELATES TO HAPPINESS EVERYN WILL TELL YOU THAT THEIR KIDS ARE THEIR GREATEST SOURCE OF JOY LEAST MOST PEOPLE WI TELL YOU THAT AND ARE TREMENDOUS SOURCE OF HAPPINESS IT'S OBVIOUS KIDS ARE DELIGHTFUL AND RAISING KIDS WHILE HARD IS A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE IF YOU LOOK AT THE RADINGS OF HAPPINESS AMONG PEOPLE THAT ELECTED ELECTED DO NOT HAVE CHILDREN VERSES THOSE THAT HAD MOST PEOPLE WHO HAVE CHILDREN REPORT THERE OVER ALL LEVELS OF HAPPINESS AS LOWER THAN THAT OF PEOPLE WHO OUGHT NOT HAVE CHILDREN  THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS TO INTERPRET THOSE FINDINGS AND BY NO MEANS OF MY ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO NOT HAVE CHILDREN I THAT'S A ISSUE THAT YOU HAVE TO RESOLVE FOR YOURSELF OF COURSE BUT WE COULD IMAGINE FOR INSTANCE THAT PEOPLE WHO OPT NOT TO HAVE CHILDREN HAVE MORE INCOME TO DEVOTE TO THINGS MORE FOCUST ON THEMSELVES OR TEIR PARTNER OR OTHER ASPECTS OF THEIR LIFE WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE UNDERLYING REASON WE COULD PERHAPS CONCLUDE THAT PEOPLE WHO OUPT NOT TO HAVE CHILDREN ARE GETTING MORE SLEEP ON A REGULAR BASIS A WER HVE MORE TIME FOR EXERCISE O THE OTHER SOURTS OF THINGS THAT ELEVATE STATES OF MOOD AND WELL BEING AGAIN WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE UNDERLYING REASONS ARE FOR THIS FINDING BUT IT DOES SEEM THAT DESPITE MOST EVERY PARENT REPORTING THAT THEIR KIDS ARE THEIR GREATA SOURCE OF JOY AND QUOTINC HAPPINESS IN LIFE THAT PEOPLE WHO OPT NOT HAVE CHILDREN ARE AT LEAST AS HAPPY OR REPORT BEING AT LEAST AS HAPPY OR EVEN HAPPIER THAN THOSE THAT OUGHT TO HAVE CHILDREN AND OF COURSE I'M I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT I'M NOT TRYING TO AM SETTLE ANY ARGUMENTS ABOUT WHETHER NOT PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE CHILDREN OR NOT I HAPPEN TO FIND CHILDREN AN ANIMALS DELIGHTFUL UM AND I'M ALWAYS HAPPY WHEN PEOPLE OGHT TO HAVE CHILDREN PROVIDED THEY ARE TAKING GOOD CARE OF THE CHILDREN OR OR DOING THEIR VERY BEST TO TAKE GOOD CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN SO THAT'S MY STANCE BUT OF COURSE YOURE ALL ENTITLED TO YOUR OWN STANCE ON THIS THEYARE ALSO THE GENERAL ARGUMENTS THAT PEOPLE LIKE TO HAVE ABOUT WHETHER NOT THE POPULATION OF THE EARTH WILL BE SUSTAINED OR NOT SUSTAIN BASED ON CURRENT BIRTH RATES AT CETERA INDEED MANY ERRS THE WORLD BIRTHRATES ARE GOING DOWN IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT UM JUST AS A PERHAPS POINT OF INTERESTS HAS BEEN A STUDIED FROM THE A SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL BUT UM A LOGICAL PERSPECTIVE OF WEATHER NOT CHILD DIPERS ARE SELLING AT THE SAME RATE AS THEY WORE SOME YEARS AGO AND WHETHER NOT ADULT DIPERS FOR THE A ELDERLY ARE BEING SOLD AT THE SAME RATE OR OR GREATER THAT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IS ONE INDIRECT MEASURE OF WHETHER NOT PEOPLE ARE LIVING LONGER AND OR UNOPTING TO HAVE CHILDREN DETHALY IN DISCUSSION FOR ANOTHER TIME PROBALY FOR ANOTHER POD CAST ENTIRELY I'D LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE OF OUR SPONSORS ATHLETIC GREENS ATHLETIC GREENS NOW CALLED  G ONE IS A VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT COVERS ALL OF YOUR FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEENS I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE SOME DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE POD CAST THEREASON I STARTY TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS AND THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLTIC GREENS ONCE ARE USUALLY TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT GETS TO BE THE PROBIOTICS THAT I NEED FOR GOT HEALTH OUR GOD IS VERY IMPORTANT ITS POPULATED BY GUP MICROBIODA THAT COMMUNICATE WITH THE BRAIN THE MMUN SYSTEM AND BASICALLY ALL THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OF OUR BODY TO STRONGLY IMPACT OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM HEALTH AND THOSE PROBIOTICS AN ATHLETIC GREENS ARE OPTIMAL AND VITAL FOR MICROBIOTIC HEALTH IN ADDITION ATHLETIC GRENS CONTAINS A NUMBER OF ADAPTEGINS VITEMENTS AND MINERALS THAT MAKE SURE THAT ALL MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS ARE MET AND IT TASTEGRIGPT IF YOU LIKE TO TRIATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS THAT MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO MIX UP ATHLETIC GREENS WHILE YOU'RE ON THE ROAD IN THE CAR ON THE PLAIN ET CETERA AND THEYLL GIVE YOU A YEARS SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THRE K TWO AGAIND THAT TATHLETI GREEN STOK CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET THE FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEARS SUPPLY OF VITEMIND THRE K TO SO THIS YOU SHAPED FUNCTION OF PEOPLE BEING HAPPIER EARLIER IN LIFE AND THEN REPORTING FEELING FAR LESS HAPPY AND THAN HAPPINESS RETURNING TO THEM THAT IS THE RISING OF THE YOU AGAIN IN THEIR LATER YEARS IS SOMETHING THAT I DOU BELIEVE SHOULD BE REPEATED IN MODERN TIMES AND REPEATED IN A WAY THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THAT THAT YOU MIGHT BE SHIFTED TO THE RIGHT THAT IS I AM CERTAINLY AWARE THAT PEOPLE ARE TENDING TO GET MERRYD LATER MANY ARE OPTING TO NOT HAVE CHILDREN SO FOR INSTANCE THE THE QUESTION ARISES WHETHER NOT THAT YOU SHAPED CURVE SHOULD HAVE A BUMP DOWN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE YOU AMONG THOSE THAT OPNOT TO HAVE CHILDREN BECAUSE THE ARGUMENT WAS MADE IN THE DISCUSSION OF THOSE PAPERS THAT THE REASON WHY HAPPINESS IS LOWER WHEN PEOPLE ARE IN THEIR THIRTIES FORTIES AND FIFTIES IS BECAUSE THEY'RE DEVOTING MORE TIME TO RAISING THEIR CHILDREN AND DEVOTING MORE TIME TO WORK I WOULD HOPE PEOPL WOULD ENJOY THEIR WORK BUT NOT EVERYBODY REALLY ENJOYS THEIR WORK IN MANY PEOPLE EVEN IF THEY DO ENJOY THEIR WORK AND THEY FIND MEANIN IN IT STILL FIND IT STRESTFUL WHICH CERTAINLY CAN RUN COUNTER TO HAPPINESS NOWADAYS YOU COULD IMAGINE THAT BECAUSE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE OPTING PERHAPS TO WORK LESS ORT TO NOT HAVE CHILDREN OR BOTH WHERE THEY FIND TREMENDOUS MEANING FROM THEIR WORK THAT THERE WOULD BE A BUMP AT THE BOTTOM OF THAT YOU AMONG THOSE THAT DESIDED TO SIMPLY NOT TAKE ON THESE ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES THT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING TEST I THINK OF WEATHERN NOT THE TOTAL LOAD OF RESPONSIBILITY IS REALLY WHAT'S CORRELATING WITH REPORTED HAPPINESS OR NOT NOW ONE VERY CONSISTENT FINDING THAT HAS ABSOLUTELY STOOD THE TEST OF TIME IT'S KAVE AN INTERESTING ONE IT SYLABIT OF A POPPSYCHOLOGY FINDING BUT I THINK IT POINTS TO SOMETHING INTERESTING THAT WELL RETURN TO AGAIN AND AGAIN IS THAT PEOPLE TEND TO REPORT FEELING LOWER LEVELS OF HAPPINESS BELIEVE ARE NOT ON THEIR BIRTHDAY A AND THE ARGUMENT FOR WHY THIS IS IS THE FOLLOWING THAT TYPICAL WE GO THROUGH OUR YEAR NOT COMPARING OURSELVES TO OUR PEERS TERRIBLY MUCH WE MIGHT DO THAT ALOW BIT MORE WHEN WE'RE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HIGH SCHOOL AT CETERA OR SORT OF AGE MATCH MAY BEVEN COLLEGE IS WELL BUT IN VALUATION OF OURSELVES TO OUR AGE MATCH PEERS IS NOT TYPICALLY SOMETHING THAT WE DO ON A DAILY BASIS REAS ON OUR BIRTHDAY WE GET A SNAP SHOT OF WHERE WE ARE IN THE ARK OF TIME ARE AT LEAST IN OUR LIFE AND MANY PEOPLE REPORT FEELING RATHER LOW ON THEIR BIRTHDAY BECAUSE THEY USE THAT AS A BENCH MARK OR A WINDOW INTO THE THINGS THAT THEY HAVE NOT ACCOMPLISHED THE THINGS THAT DESPITE BEING AGE BLANK THEY STILL HAVEN'T ACCOMPLISHED AND O THAT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE OF WHAT IT REALLY POINTS TO IS TWO THINGS ONE THE EXTEND TO WHICH MUCH OF OUR FEELINGS OF HAPPINESS ARE RELATIVE IN PARTICULAR RELATIVE TO OUR PEERS O THERE'S THAT SOCIAL ASPECT AGAIN AND THE FACT THAT MOST OF THE TIME WE ARE NOT VERY GOOD AT ORIENTING OURSELVES IN THE LONGER ARK OF TIME WERE PRETTY GOOD AT KNOWING WHERE WE ARE IN THE ARK OF A DAY OR THE ARK OF A WEEK OR THE ARK OF A MONTH OR EVEN A YEAR BUT THAT MOST OF US ARE NOT VERY GOOD AT REFLECTING ON WHERE WE ARE IN OUR LIFE ARE CAN OF COURSE MOST OF US DON'T KNOW HOW LONG WE WILL LIVE ANYWAY BUT WE DO HAVE SOME GENERAL SENSE AND VERY FEW PEOPLE LIVE PAST THE AGE OF ONE HUNDRED MANY PEOPLE LIVE TO BE SEVENTY OR EIGHTY AND AGAIN LIFE SPEN IS EXTENDING AS FAR AS WE KNOW YEAR TA YEAR BUT IN GENERAL PEOPLE REPORT THAT ON THEIR BIRTHDAYS AND I SHOULD SAY THESE ARE FOR BIRTHDAYS AGED TWENTY FIVE OR LATER AT LEAST IN THE STUDIES I WAS ABLE TO ACCESS RIGHT I DON'T THINK THAT A LOT OF THREE YEAR OLD SIT AROUND COMPARING THEMSELVES TO OTHER THREE YEAR OLDS AND HOW WELL THEY'RE DOING OR TWELVE YEAR OLDS YOU CAN IMAGINE SOME PEOPLE MIGHT DO THAT AT EIGHTEEN AT CETERA BUT IT'S REALLY BY THE MID TWENTIES THAT PEOPLE START O VALUATING THEMSELVES TO THEIR PEERS IN TERMS OF LIFE PROGRESSION AND SO CALLED MILESTONES IT'S BEEN ARGUE THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY PEOPLEL REPORT LOWER AFFECT LOWER LEVELS OF HAPPINESS ON THEIR BIRTHDAY SOMETHING THAT'S A LIMIT A COUNTER INTUITIVE AND OF COURSE THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE ANTICORRELATED WITH HAPPINESS I BE WRE MYSSIFIED IN MENTION A FEWITIES THAT'S LONGITUNERAL STUDY  THE HARVARD HAPPINESS PROJECT HAS REPORTED FOR INSTANCE THAT PEOPLE THAT ARE CHRONIC SMOKERS OF NICOTINE AND CHRONIC CONSUMERS OF ALCHOLL IN PARTICULAR ALCOHOLICS THAT IS PEOPLE SUFFER FROM ALCHOLISM OR WHAT SOMETIMES CALLED ALCHOL USE DICE ORDER THAT IS STRONGLY ANTICORELATED WITH HAPPINESS AND I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THAT THE F AMILY MEMBERS AND IN PARTICULAR THE ROMANTIC PARTNERS OF PEOPLE WHO AR CHRONIC SMOKERS AND THE PARTNERS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE CHRONIC ALKOHOL USERS OFTEN WILL REPORT LOWER LEVELS OF HAPPINESS ESPECIALLY IF THEY THEMSELVES ARE NOT CHRONIC SMOKERS OR REGULAR CONSUMERS OF ALKOHOL SO WE'VE DONE EPISODES ON NICOTINE IN PARTICULAR AND THAT TOUCHED ON SMOKING OF COURSE AND WEVE A AN EPISODE ON ALCHOL AND THE EFFECTS OF ALKOHOL ON HEALTH AGAIN YOU CAN FIND THOSE AT HUBERMEN LAVEDOK KOM THIS STUDY OF FROM THE HARVARD HAPPINESS PROJECT REALLY HAS STRONG DATA SUPPORTING THE FACT THAT AVOIDING BEING IN NICOTINE SMOKER RIGHT THERE ARE POSIVE HEALTH EFFECTS OF NICOTINE THAT ARE DISCUSSED IN THE EPISOD NICOTINE BUT BEING A BUT SMOKING NICOTINE IN PARTICULAR IS COUNTER PRODUCTIVE FOR PEOPLE'S LEAT SELF REPORTED HAPPINESS AND CERTAINLY OVER ALL HEALTH ITHING THERE'S ZERO QUESTION THAT SMOKING INCREASES CANCERS OVR DIFFERENT KINDS AND THAT ALCHOL CONSUMPTION IN PARTICULAR ALKOHOLL CONSUMPTION BEYOND TWO DRINKS PER WEEK TWO DRINKS BEING THE TYPICAL VOLUME OF YOU KNOW A BEER GLASSAWINE OR  COCKTAL ET CETERA IS DETRIMENTAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF HEALTH AND OF COURSE THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU COULD IMAGINE WOULD RELATE TO A LACK OF HAPPINESS FOR INSTANCE A MAJOR TRAMA PHYSICAL OR EMOTIONAL TRAMA ATHAT COULD INCLUDE THE LOSS OF A MAJOR RELATIONSHIP A DEATH OF A CLOSE ONE ON BEING THE VICTIM OF A VIOLENT CRIME AND THINGS OF THAT SORT AND YET IT'S BEEN ARGUED IN FACT STRONGLY ARGUED THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT PEOPLE'S LEVELS OF HAPPINESS AFTER A TRAMA THAT IF YOU WAIT ABOUT A YEAR OR SO SOMETIMES AS EVEN AS SHORT AS THREE MONTHS HAFTER A TRAMA THAT PEOPLE SELF REPORTED LEVELS OF HAPPINESS ARE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THEY WERE PRIOR TO THE TRAMA NOW I VERY MUCH WONT TO HIGHLIGHT UNDERLINE AND BOLD AND ASTRICTS THAT STATEMENT AS ONE THAT WE REALLY NEED TO EXPLORE CAREFULLY BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER DATA THAT STRONGLY POINT TO THE FACT THAT MAJOR LIFE TRAMAS CAN SEVERELY DESTRUPT ONE SENSE OF HAPPINESS IN WELL BEING AND I THINK AS LONG AS WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION WE SHOULD POINT TO A USEFUL DEFINITION OF TRAMA AND THE DEFINITION THAT I'LL PERAPHRASES ONE THAT WAS SUPPLIED BY A FORMER GUEST ON THE HUBRAN LAPODCAST DOCTOROPOLL CONTI WHO'S A PSYCHIATRIS WHOSE WRITTEN A BOOK CALLED TRAMA I PERSONALLY THINK ITS THE BEST BOOK ON TRAMA AND TOOLS FOR ALLEVIATING TRAMAS INCREDIBLY THOROUGH EASY TO READ AND WELL INFORMED AND HERE AGAIN ON PRAPHRASING BUT DOCTOR CRANTI DESCRIBES TRAMAS SOMETHING THAT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGES THE WAY THAT ARE BRAIN AND BODY FUNCTION IN A WAY THAT MAKES OTHER ASPECTS OF LIVING MORE THALLENGING AGAIND AN EVENT EITHER EMOTIONAL OR PHYSICAL OR BOTH THAT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGES THE WAY THAT ARE BRAIN END OR BODY SAR ARE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND OTHER ORGAN'S FUNCTION IN A WAY THAT PREVENTS US FROM IN ENJOYING DAING DAILY ACTIVITIES ANDTHAT COULD EVEN BE ON GOING DISTRACTION RIHTE TRAMAS CAN I CREATE RUMINATION OR THEY CAN CREATE OBSESSIVE THOUGHT OR THEY CAN CREATE DISSOCIATION ANY NUMBER DIFFERENT THINGS AGAIN CHICK OUT THAT EPISODE A DOCTOR A PALKONTI IF YOU'D LIKE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT TRAMA AND HOW IT MANIFESTS BUT THE IDEA THAT'S BEEN PUT FORTH BY A NUMBER OF RESEARCHERS IN THE IN THE FIELD OF HAPPINESS THAT THREE MONTHS AFTER A MAJOR TRAMA PEOPLE AREN'T REPORTING THAT THEY ARE FEELING ANY LESS HAPPY THAN BEFORE THE TRAMA THAT WAS SURPRISING TO ME SO I AND WENT INTO THIS LITERATURE A BIT MORE DEEPLY ONE OF THE BASIS OF THAT GENERAL LINE OF THINKING IS A WHAT I CONSIDER NOW CLASSIC AND AND VERY IMPORTANT AND FRANKLY EXCELLENT TALK THAT WAS GIVEN BY PROFESSOR DAN GILBERT ON THE SCIENCE OF HAPPINESS YOU CAN FINDNESS ON YOU TO I SAY CLASSIC ONE BECAUSE IT WAS IT WAS DONE SOME YEARS AGO S RECEIVED A NOMILLIONS OF YEWS AND ONE OF THE POINTS THAT HE MAKES IN THAT TALK WHICH IS GROUNDED IN RESEARCH CARRIED OUT BY HIS LABORATORY AND OTHER LABORATORIES IS THAT HE POSES A QUESTION HE SAYS YOU KNOW LET'S DO A QUIS WOULH YOU RATHER BE SOME ONE WHO WINS THE LOTTERY AND SHOWS A PICTURE OF SOMEBODY WHO JUST ONE I THINK OF SEVERAL HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN E LOTTERY OR WAS RECENTLY MADE PARAPLEGIC A LOST USE OF THEIR LEGS AND THEN GOES ON TO STATE THAT ONE YEAR AFTER PEOPLE HAVE WON THE LOTTERY THIS MAJOR YOU KNOW MONITORY WINDFALL VERSES HAVE BECOME PARAPLEGIC IS THAT THERE SELF REPORTED LEVELS OF HAPPINESS ARE THE SAME WHICH I THINK IS INCREDIBLY SURPRISING NOW I HEARD THIS AND I IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT OF AN EXPERIENCE THAT I'VE HAD WHERE I TEACH A COURSE AT STAMFORD CHOOL OF MEDICINE ON NERAL REGENERATION AND IT'S ACUALY A COURSE THAT I ATTENDED SOME YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS A POSTOCK AT STAMFORD WELL OVER A DECATE AGO AND WE HAD EXCUSE ME WE HAD AN INDIVIDUAL COME INTO THE COURSE THE WAS A AN OLDER GENTLEMAN SO OLDER MEANING HE WAS IN HIS EARLY SEVENTIES AND HE HAD BECOME PARAPLEGIC FAIRLY LATE IN LIFE FROM A CYCLING ACCIDENT AND HE WAS AND IS AN EXPERT IN WHAT IT IS TO BECOME A PARAPLEGIC OF COURSE CAUS HE HAD THAT EXPERIENCE BUT ALSO BECAUSE HE SPENDS A LOT OF HIS TIME DOING VOLUNTEER WORK WITH PEOPLE WHOHAVE BECOME PARAPLEGIC AND HAVE BECOME PARAPLEGIC AT IFFERENT AGES AND WHAT HE DESCRIBED TO ME WAS THAT THE OVERALL OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE RENDERED PARAPLEGIC IN TERMS OF THEIR MENTAL HEALTH IN THEIR PHYSICAL WELL BEING THERE A SORT OF MANAGEMENT OF GENERAL LIFE SKILLS SKCALES WITH HOW EARLY THEY HAD THAT INJURY AND HOW LONG THEY HAD THE USE OF THEIR LIMBS SO IT'S NOT STRAIGHTFORWARD WHEN I HEARD THIS RESULT DESCRIBED BY DOCTOR DAN GILBERT THAT WINNING THE LOTTERY AND BECOMING PARAPLEGIC BASICALLY DON'T IMPACT YOUR LEVELS OF HAPPINESS TO ANY DIFFERENT DEGREE WHEN YOU KNON'T PEOPLE LOOK BACK A YEAR OR LATER I WAS PRETTY SURPRISE GIVEN MY PERIENCE OF HEARING THIS THIS LECTURE AT STAMFORD I THOUGHT WELL FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND INDEED THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE RENDERED PAROPLEGIC AND MANAGE THAT TRANSITION VERY EASILY IT DOESN'T SEEM TO UM DISRUPT THEIR FEELINGS A WELL BEING AT CETERA BUT FOR OTHER PEOPLE IT CAN BE UM SEVERELY DESRUPTING TO THEIR SENSE OF WELL BEING AND SO ON AND SO FORTH I WENT BACK IN EXAMINED THESE DATA AND IN FACT A SUBSEQUENT TALK IS ECTUALLY A PODCASTS THAT WAS GIVEN BY DOCTOR DAN GILBERT SOME YEARS LATER STHES SO BE JUST A FEW YEARS AGO I THINK I TWENTY NINETEEN AS THE IS THE SPECIFIC DATE WOICH I WAS RECORDED BUT JUST A FEW YEARS AGO AND INDEED HE CORRECTS HIMSELF IN THAT PODCAST WHAT HE SAYS IS THAT HE MISSPOKE IN THAT EARLIER TALK THAT THE DIFFERENCE IN SELF REPORTED LEVELS OF HAPPINESS FOR THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN RENDERED PARAPLEGIC FOR VERSES THOSE WHO'VE WON THE LOTTERY IS NOT AS GREAT AS ONE WOULD EXPECT YOU NOT THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD EXPECT THAT BEING RENDERED PARAPLEGIC WOULD MAKE PEOPLE FAR LESS HAPPY THAT'S THE EXPECTATION I THINK ANYWAY AND THAT PEOPLE WOULD WIN THE LOTTERY AT LEAST FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME WOULD BE FAR HAPPIER THAN THEY WERE PRIOR TO AWINNING THE LOTTERY ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF F MONEY AND AGAIN THE FACT THAT MONEY CAN'T BUY HAPPINESS BUT THAT MONEY DOES INDEED ENABLE THE ABILITY OF BUFFER STRESS PROVIDED PEOPLE WERE OU RESPONSIBLE WITH THAT MONEY AND IS BLOWIT OR SPENDED ALL RIGHT AWAY THAT THEY COULD START TO AFFORD THINGS THAT THEY COULDN' AFFORD NOCHUS IN TERMS OF LUXURY ITEMS BUT ALSO THE ABILITY TO HIGHER HELP THAT WOULD FREE UP TIME THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO DO ANYTHING FROM A TRAVEL THAT THEY CONDACTS US BEFORE TO MEDITATE IF THAT WAS SOMETHIG THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO DO BEFORE AND SO ON AND SO FORTH SO THE RESULT QUOTIN QUOTE THAT WINNERS OF THE LOTTERY AND RECENT PARAPLEGICS HAVE THE SAME LEVELS OF HAPPINESS IS ACTUALLY NOT TRUE AT LEAST ACCORDING TO THE AUTHOR OF THE ORIGINAL STUDY NOW WHAT HE DID NOT POINT TO IS THE DEGREE TO WHICH THAT IS NOT TRUE BUT HE DID POINT TO THE DIRECTION OF THE RESULT AND THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE RENDERED PARAPLEGIC IN FACT ARE REPORTING THEMSELVES AS LESS HAPPY THAN THEY WERE PRIOR TO THEIR INJURY AND CERTAINLY THAT THEIR LEVELS OF HAPPINESS ARE LOWER THAN THOSE O THAT SIMPLY ON THE LOTTERY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WHICH I THINK IT'S THEM MORE I INTUITIVE RESULT AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE AWARE OF OF THAT DISCREPANCY BECAUSE IT SOMETHING THAT WAS LOST IN THE COMMUNICATION UM A AROUND THOSE RESULTS THE FIRST TIME AROUND AND INDEED AM DAN GILBERT A IS AN EXCELLENT SCIENTISTS AND AND WAS A QUITE GOOD ABOUT TRYING TO CORRECT THE NARRATIVE I MYSELF AS A A PARCASTER WHO PUTS INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET KNOW THAT THE CHALLENGES OF CORRECTING NARRATIVES ESPECIALLY OF THINGS THAT THAT CAME OUT UM SOME TIME AGO WE ALWAYS ATTEMPT TO DO THIS AS BEST WE CAN BUT NOT EVERY ONE THAT SAW THAT FIRST VIDIA WILL NECESSARILY HEAR THE DISCUSSION THE HAPS HAPPEND SUBSEQUENTLY SO MY HOPE IS U THAT DOCTOR GILBERT ERE WILL INTERPRET ME COMMUNICATING THIS NOW NOT AS AN ATTEMPT TO CRITICIZIM BUT RATHER AS AN ATTEMPT TO APPRAISE HIS WILLINGNESS TO TRY AND CORRECT THE NARRATIVE TO BE MORE ACCURATE SO TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THIS STUDY DID AND IN SHOW AND HERE I 'M GOING TO COMBINE THESE RESULTS WITH OTHER STUDIES THAT I WAS ABLE TO FIND THAT EXPLORED SIMILAR PHENOMENA SO A MAJOR TRAMA FOR INSTANCE NOT NESARILY BECOMING PARAPLEGIC BUT TRAMAS OF A DIFFERENT SORT A EMOTIONAL TRAMAS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WHOLE OF THOSE DATA LEAST MY READ IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE WHIN THE LOTTERY OR ACQUIR WEALTH THROUGH INHERITANCE SOME FORM OF WEALTH ACQUISITION THAT IS SUDDEN AND THAT WASN'T PRECEDED BY A SPECIFIC EFFORT TO GAIN THAT WEALTH RIGHT BYING A LOTTERYTICKET IS PRETTY QUICK THING A INHERITANCE IS SOMETHING THAT YOU SIMPLY GET BY VIRTUE OF WHO YOU ARE NOT NESARILY BY EFFORT WELL THAT LED TO INCREASES IN SELF REPORTED HAPPINESS COMPARED TO PRIOR TO THE INHERITANCE OF THE LOTTERY WHEN BUT IT WASN'T AS SUBSTANTIAL AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE IF YOU ARE APPROACHING THE NOTION OF HAPPINESS SIMPLY FROM WELL MORE MONEY EQUALS MORE HAPPINESS AND WHILE IT IS TRUE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE RENDERED PAROPLEGIC OR WHO UNDERGO PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAMAS PHYSICAL TRAMAS OF ANY VARIOUS KIND ARE AND FRANKLY ARE REMARKABLY RESILIENT IN MANY CASES THEY CAN STILL MAN SHOULD GO ABOUT LIFE AND AND WORK AND ENGAGE IN RELATIONSHIPS ET CETERA THERE IS A VISIBLE DECREASE IN OVER ALL LEVELS OF HAPPINESS AND WELL BEING IN PARTICULAR IF THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL TRAMA RENDERS THERE NERVOUS SYSTEM DIFFERENT IN A WAY THAT IMPACTS OTHER MAJOR AREAS OF LIFE AND ENJOYMENT FOR THEM AND THAT CERTAINLY TRUE ONE YEAR OUT FROM THE TRAMA SO THE POINT IS THAT WE DO NEED TO REFRAME THIS IDEA THAT WHETHER NOT YOU WIN THE LOTTERIER BECOME PAROPLEGIC ORE SUFFER SOME MAJOR TRAMA YOUR LEVELS OF HAPPINESS ARE GOING TO BE THE SAME THREE MONTHS OR A YEAR LATER I DON'T THINK THATS ACCURATE AND IN FACT OCTOR DAN GILBERT EMPHASIZE THAT'S NOT ACCURATE AM EVEN IN THAT INITIAL STUDY AND I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT THING TO FRAME BECAUSE THAT SUCH A POPULAR NOTION OR THAT THAT IDEA COMBINED WITH THE IDEA THAT INCREASED EARNINGS DON'T MAKE US HAPPY COMBINED WITH THE IDEA THAT YOU KNOW WE ARE HAPPY EARLIR IN LIFE AM BUT THEN AS MORE DEMANDS ARISE IN LIFE WE BECOME LESS HAPPY AND THAN W BECOME HAPPY AGAIN AND AND THAT IDEAS WE ALREADY EXPLORED IS NOT NECESSARILY TRUE FRANKLY I KNEW A LOT OF TEA NAJORS AND PEOPLE IN THEIR THEIR EARLY TWENTIES ARE PRETTY UNHAPPY WHO THEN BECOME HAPPI ER LATER AS THEY ACQUIRE MORE RESOURCES SOMETIMES DISTANCE LET'S BEONA SOMETIMES DISTANT FROM OUR FAMILY OF ORIGIN MAKES US MORE HAPPY SOMETIMES LESS SO IT'S HIGHLY INDIVIDUAL SO I THINK THOSE GENERAL THEMES THAT WEVE HEARD OVER AND OVER WHILE THEY HAVE MERIT AND THEY CERTAINLY STAND UP IN SOME OF THE MORE POWERFUL LONGITUDAL AND SHORT TERM STUDIES THERE IS NEUANTS AND IN SOME CASES THERE ARE NOW ADDITIONAL DATA THAT ARE CAUSING US TO REVISE THOSE UNDERSTANDINGS NOW THERE IS AN IMPORTANT POINT OR I SHOULD SAY THE IMPORTANT POINT THAT WE CAN REALLY CREDIT DAN GILBERT AND OTHERS IN THE FIELD OF PSYCHOLOGY WITHAN THAT WE OWE THEM A GREAT DEBT OF GRATITUDE FOR IS THAT WE DO HAVE FAR MORE CONTROL OVER OUR LEVELS OF HAPPINESS THAN WE MIGHT THINK AND MANY OF THE THINGS THAT RESIDED AT THAT LEVEL OF CONTROL THAT IS THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO AND THINK AND SAY AND ACCESS DON'T COME FROM EXTERNAL THINGS S RIGHT THEY DON'T COME NECESSARILY FROM THE ACQUISITION OF MATERIAL GOODS BUT RATHER THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO THAT CAN ALLOW US TO SO CALLED SYNTHESIZE HAPPINESS AND I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT GIFTS OF MODERN PSYCHOLOGY IS THAT DAN GILBERT AND OTHERS THE HARVARD HAPPINESS PROJECT WORK AT YALE AND ELSEWHERE RIGHT THEIR EXCELLENT LABS WORKING ON HAPPINESS ALL OVER THE US END AND ALL OVER THE WORLD FRANKLY ONE OF THE GREAT GIFTS THAT THEY'VE SUPPLIED US IN THE FORM OF DATA IS THAT THERE REALLY ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN ALL DO AND THINK AN ACCESS TO ALLOW OURSELVES TO SO CALLED SYNTHESIZE HAPPINESS NOW THIS NOTION OF SYNTHSYNTHESIZING HAPPINESS OR SYNTHETIC HAPPINESS AS IT SOMETIMES CALLED CAN SOMETIMES RUFFLE PEOPLE'S FEATHERS OF BIT BECAUSE PEOPLE IMMEDIATELY FLIP TO THE IDEA THAT OH YOU'RE JUST GON TO TELL ME TO BE GRATEFUL FOR WHAT I HAVE OR TO JUST NAVAL GAZE OR JUST TO IMAGINE THAT I AM HAPPY THAT'S REALLY NOT WHAT SYNTHETIC HAPPINESS IS ABOUT AT ALL SYNTHETIC HAPPINESS ACTUALLY HAS TO DO WITH SOME REALLY IMPORTANT LARGER PRINCIPLES ABOUT THE WAY THAT ARE EMOTIONAL SYSTEM AND THE WAY THAT THE REWARD SYSTEMS OF OUR BRAIN REALLY FUNCTION AND THEY POINT TO IMPORTANT CONCEPTS THAT WERE GOIN ANOU DISCUSS THINGS LIKE THE HEDONIC SET POINT FOR INSTANCE OR THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM OF ANTICIPATION OF REWARDS VERSES RECEIVING WORDS JUST AS A BRIEF O INSITE INTO THAT OUR ANTICIPATION OF SOMETHING POSITIVE OFTEN TIMES LEADS TO GREATER INCREASES IN THE SORTS OF NAURO CHEMICALS THAT SUPPORT A STATE OF HAPPINESS AND WELL BEING THAN THE ACTUAL ACQUISITION OF THE THING THAT WERE TRYING TO OBTAIN AND THIS GOES BACK TO A THEME I'VE DISCUSSED A FEW TIMES BEFORE IN THIS PODCAST ON IN PARTICULAR WITH A MYCOLLIGAT STAMPORD SCHOOL MEDICINE DOCTOR ON OLEMPKI WHO WROTE THE FABULOUS BOOK DOPAMINE NATION IF YOUR INTERST IN DOPAMINE THAN A DICTION IN PARTICULAR THAT'S A WONDERFUL CLEAR AN EXTREMELY IN FORMATIVE READ AND IF YOUR INTERESTED IN DOPAMIN MORE GENERALLY JUST NOJUSON THE STATES OF ADICTION BUT IN EVERY DAY LIFE AND IN PURSUIT IN MOTIVATION O THE MOLECULE OF MORE IS AN EXCELLENT BOOK AR RELATED TO THAT AND AS I MENTION EARLY WE HAVE THIS EPISODE ON DOPAMINE MOTIVATION AND DRIVE THE THE NOTION OF SYNTHETIC HAPPINESS IS NOT SYMPLY ABOUT IMAGINING HAPPINESS ORE THINKING ABOUT HAPPINESS OR ANTICIPATING HAPPINESS TO SOME EXTENT IT IS BUT IT RELATES TO A NUMBER OF OTHER IMPORTANT THEMES BUT IT IS GROUNDED VERY THOROUGHLY IN THE NEUROBIOLOGY OF DOPAMINE REWARDS AND I'LL TALK ABOUT SOME OF THAT NEUROBIOLOGY IN A FEW MOMENTS BUT I WANT TO TAKE A COUPLE OF MINUTES AND TALK ABOUT WHAT SYNTHETIC HAPPINESS IS AND WHAT SOME OF THE CONDITIONS ARE FOR ALLOWING US TO ACCESS THES STATE OF SO CALLED SYNTHETIC HAPPINESS AND I WANT TO POINT OUT AT THE OUTSET THAT SYNTHETIC HAPPINESS WHILE IT MIGHT SOUND SYNTHETIC A K A FALSE IT'S ANYTHING BUT IT ACTUALLY TURNS OUT TO BE AMONG THE MORE AND PERHAPS THE MORE POTENT FORM OF HAPPINESS THAT WE CAN ALL HACCESS AND THIS IS WHERE THEMES IN RELATED TO OUR CONTROL OVER OUR OWN INTERNAL STATE REALLY BECOME NOT ONLY VALID BUT VERY POWERFUL SO FOR INSTANCE DOCTOR DAN GILBERT AND OTHERS HAVE EXPLORED HOW OPPORTUNITY AND CHOICE THAT IS FREEDOM CAN AND CAN'T LEAD TO STATES OF HAPPINESS AND THE RESULTS OF THOSE STUDIES ARE VERY SOLID AND FRANKLY VERY SURPRISING UNTIL YOU UNDERSTAND THE RESULTS AND ONCE YOU DO I THINK YOU WILL IMMEDIATELY SEE AREAS OF YOUR OWN LIFE THAT YOU CAN START TO ACCESS MORE HAPPINESS AGAIN GENUINE HAPPINESS SIMPLY BY FRAMING CERTAIN CHOICES IN A PARTICULAR WAY AND MAY BE EVEN BY ELIMINATING CHOICIS NOW I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON THE RESEARCH AIMED AT UNDERSTANDING WHAT INCREASES ARE LEVELS OF HAPPINESS AND I'D LIKE TO FRAME THIS UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF TWO MAJOR THEMES THE FIRST THEME IS SO CALLED NATURAL HAPPINESS NATURAL HAPPINESS IS THE SORT OF HAPPINESS THAT MOST OF US ARE FAMILIAR WITH SO THE KIND OF HAPPINESS THAT WE EXPECT TO HAVE IF WE FOR INSTANCE COMPLETE A DEGREE OF FLEE A DEGREE IN A TOPIC MEANINGFUL AND INTERESTING TO US BUT A DEGREE NONE THE LESS OR WE FIND A MATE HOPEFULLY A MATE THAT WE ENJOY SPENDING TIME WITH OR FOR INSTANCE MAKING A CERTAIN INCOME OR FINDING WORK THAT WE ENJOY ON A REGULAR BASIS ALL OF THOSE ARE FORMS OF HAPPINESS THAT FROM A VERY EARLY TIME AND DEVELOPMENT WE ARE TAUGHT EXISS FOR INSTANCE EVEN WHEN WE ARE VERY YOUNG WE ARE TOLD THAT OUR BIRTHDAY IS COMING AND THAT WE ARE GOING TO GET PRESENTES AN THOSE PRESENTS ARE GOING TO BE FOCUSED ON KNOWLEDGE OF THINGS THAT WE ALREADY ENJOY SO FERE LITTLE KID AND YOU LIKE CHUCKS OR YOUR LITTLE KID AND YOU LIKE DULLS YOU CAN SORT OF EXPECT THAT THOSE GIFTS WILL BRING YOU SOME LEVEL OF JOY OR HAPPINESS AND WHILE THAT'S A SMALL CHILD EXAMPL THAT GENERAL NOTION OF NATURAL HAPPINESS IS OF COURSE ONE THAT PERSISTS INTO ADOLESCENCE INTO YOUNG ADULTHOOD AND INTO ADULTHOOD AND WE QUITE UNDERSTANDABLY COME TO ASSOCIATE THIS FEELING OF JOY OR HAPPINESS WITH THE RECEIVING OF THINGS OR THE ACQUISITION OF THINGS WHETHER BY EFFORT BY GIFT BY INHERITANCE OR SOME OTHER FORM SO THAT'S NATURAL HAPPINSS AND YET AS I MENTIOND TO LOBIT EARLIER THERE'IS ALSO THIS NOTION OF SYNTHETIC HAPPINESS AND SOME OF THE MORE INTERESTING AND EXCITING RESEARCH IN THE FIELDS OF PSYCHOLOGY AND INFACT NORAL SCIENCE POINT TO THIS IDEA OF SYNTHETIC HAPPINESS AS AT LEAST AS POWERFUL A SOURCE OF HAPPINESS AS NATURAL HAPPINESS AGAIN AT LEAST AS POWERFUL AND PERHAPS EVEN MORE POWERFUL AND OF COURSE ONE HAS TO TAKE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT VIEW OF WHAT HAPPINESS IS IN ORDER TO ACCEPT THIS IDEA THAT WE CAN CREATE HAPPINESS FOR OURSELVES BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE WHOLE NOTION OF SYNTHETIC HAPPINESS IS MERELY A PASSIVE ONE WHERE ALL WE DO IS SIT BACK AND IMAGINE BEING HAPPI IN THAN WE ARE HAPPY AFOR BETTER FOR WORSE ARE NERVOUS SYSTEMS AND OUR NER CHEMISTRY SIMPLY DON'T WORK THAT WAY IN FACT SYNTHETIC HAPPINESS HAS ALMOST ALWAYS BEEN UNDERSTOOD AS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO PUT SOME EFFORT TOWARD ACHIEVING BUT AND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT THING TO POINT OUT SYNTHETIC HAPPINESS ALSO REQUIRES THAT CERTAIN SITUATIONAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS BE MET A GOOD EXAMPLE THIS IS SOME OF THE WORK BY GILLIAN MANDICH OR ASHUS A DOCTOR GILIAN MANDICH WHOS DONE SOME INTERESTING WORK ON THE CONDITIONS FOR CREATING HAPPINESS WITHIN OUR MIND AND IN OUR OVER ALL STATE OF BEING AND SHE'S BEEN INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT STUDIES BUT ONE OF THE ONES THAT I FOUND ON PARTICULARLY INTERESTING IS ONE IN WHICH THEY EXPLORED DIFFERENT TYPES OF MUSIC AND OTHER ASPECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SETTINGS SO YOU BRING SUBJECT TO THE LABORATORY PLAY THEM DIFFERENT TYPES OF MUSIC THERE ARE IN FACT CERTAIN ASPECTS OF MUSIC THAT CAN CREATE DIFFERENT STATES OF MIND SADNESS HAPPINESS ANTICIPATION AIN FACT THERE ARE CERTAIN PATTERNS OF MUSIC THAT CAN RELIABLY INDUCE ANTICIPATION OF THE FEAR AND ANXIETY BASE TYPE SO FORINSTANCS THINK THE MOVI JAWS A IF YOU RECALL A FOR THOSE WE SEEN JAWS THERES THIS ON GOING THEME MUSIC ANY TIME THE SHARK MIGHT BE A PRESENT IN THE WATER OR AN A GIVEN SCENE THAT SENTRY GOES TUNOW FOR THE MUSICIANS OUT THERE THIS HAS BASIS AND THINGS LIKE TRY TONES AND THINGS THAT ARE UNDERSTOOD FROM THE MATHEMATICS AND AND THE MUSICAL SIDE AND FROM THE NEURO SCIENCE SIDE ARE KNOWN TO CREATE A NOURAL STATE OF ANTICIPATION YET A NEURAL STATE OF ANTICIPATION AND NOT NECESSARILY A POSITIVE ONE AND INDEED THERE ARE OTHER PATTERNS OF MUSIC THAT INVOLVE UPTONES AM THINK SOME OF THE A MUSIC THATS A TYPICALLY BEEN USED IN CARTOONS OF VARIOUS SORTS THERE'S A LONG HISTORY OF THIS INDEETHERE' THE WHOLE LITERATURE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND NOW EVEN A SMALLER BUT STILL INTERESTING LITERATURE ON THE NARROW SCIENCE OF HOW CERTAIN PATTERNS OF MUSIC CAN INDUCE A STATE OF JOY AND JOYFUL ANTICIPATION IN PARTICULAR A LOT OF THOSE PATTERNS OF MUSIC ARE INCORPORATED INTO SO CLE HAPPY CARTOONS AND DIZZNY MOVINGS AND THINGS OF THAT SORT IN ANY CASE DOCTOR MANDICH AND OTHERS HAVE EXPLORED HOW MUSIC IN PARTICULAR BUT OTHER FEATURES OF THE ENVIRONMENT CAN OR CANNOT INDUCE STATES OF HAPPINESS AND THE BASIC TAKE AWAY FROM THOSE STUDIES IS THAT WHILE HAVING A CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL SOUND MUSICAL TONE OR VISUAL FEATURE TO A GIVEN SPACE A ROOM IS NECESSARY FOR A STATE OF HAPPINESS IT IS NOT ALONE SUFFICION WHAT IS REQUIRED IS THAT INDIVIDUALS NOT ONLY BE PLACED IN TO AND ENVIRONMENT THAT CONTAINS MUSIC OR VISUAL ITEMS OR A COMMINATION OF MUSIC AND VISUAL ITEMS THAT CAN INDUCE STATES OF JOY OR HAPPINESS OR POSITIVE ANTICIPATION BUT THAT THEY ALSO ARE GIVEN SOME SORT OF INSTRUCTION OR INSTRUCTION MANUAL AS TO HOW TO SYNTHESIZE HAPPINESS INSIDE OF THAT ENVIRONMENT THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHAT THIS SAYS IS THAT OUR ABILITY TO CREATE STATES OF HAPPINESS IS DEPENDENT ON OUR ENVIRONMENT BUT ALSO REQUIRES EFFORT FROM US THAT ALSO MAKE SENSE AS TO WHY WHEN WE ARE UNDER CONDITIONS OF DEPRIVATION S O CO BE SOCIAL DEPRIVATION OR FINANCIAL DEPRIVATION OR EVEN FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO WEATHER ANOTHERE ARE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS ABOUT THIRTY PER CENT OF PEOPLE WHO REPORT FEELING VERY VERY LOW UNDER CONDITIONS WHERE THE SKY IS OVERCAST I ESPECIALLYIF I' BEEN OVERCAST FOR A NUMBER OF DAYS THE SO CALLED SEASONAL EFFECTIVE DEPRESSION THOSE INDIVIDUALS BY THE WAY CAN OFTEN RECEIVE TREMENDOUS BENEFITS IN TERMS OF ELEVATING THEIR MOOD IF THEY MAKE AN EFFORT TO GET SUNLIGHT AND IF THEY CAN'T GET SUNLIGHT ARTIFICIAL LIGHT OF THE SORT THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER BUT IN ANY CASE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE PROFOUNDLY NEGATIVELY INFLUENCED BY THE LACK OF POSITIVE VISUAL AND AUDITORY CUSE IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT BUT FOR MOST PEOPLE WE ARE IN A WHAT I WOILD CALL IT DYNAMIC RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR ENVIRONMENT OUR ENVIRONMENT HAS AN EFFECT ON OUR MOOD BUT THE RESEARCH INDICATES THAT WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SOME SORT OF EFFORT TOWARD BEING HAPPY EFFORT TOWARD BEING HAPPY IS A VERY VAGUE TERM SO LIT'S BETTER DEFINE WHAT THAT IS IN THE CASE OF DOCTOR MANDAGEIS WORK THIS TOOK THE FORM OF DOING SO CALLED HAPPINESS INVENTORIES RIGHT A THAT CAN BE FOCUSSING ON THINGS THAT ONE IS GRATEFUL FOR AM THINGS THAT THEY PARTICULARLY ENJOY THIS IS SOMEWHAT OF A GRATITUDE TYHT PRACTISE BUT INCLUDES SOME OTHER FEATURES AS WELL THAT ARE MORE FOCUS ON THE THINGS THAT BRING YOU MEANING AND ACTUALLY ENGAGING IN THE THINGS THAT BRING YOU MEANING SO IF YOUR TRIN TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO IMPROVE YOUR LEVELS OF HAPPINESS WHUT THIS RESEARCH ES SENTIALLY SAYS IS THAT YOU WOULD BE SMART TO TRY AND ADJUST YOUR HOME ENVIRONMENT ADJUST YOUR WORK ENVIRONMENT SO THAT IT IS CHEERFUL TO YOU MAY BE THAT MEANS A PLANT FOR ME IN MY LABORATORY O ONE OF THE THNGS THAT WAS REALLY CRITICAL THAT I HAD AS A POSTOC AND A IN MY OWN LABORATORY WHEN I FIRST START OF MY LAB WAS I LOVE AQUARIA SO I HAD MULTIPLE FISH TANKS IN FACT PEOPLE MY LABORATOR WERE ALWAYS ROLLING THEIR EYES WHYD WE HAVE TO HAVE ALL THESE FISH TANKS WITH ALL THESE I LIKE FRESH WATER TANKS NOTA SALT WATER TANKS O FOR REASONS THAT AREN'T INTERESTING FOR THIS DISCUSSION BUT FRESH WATER TANKS WITH DISCOUS FISH FOR INSTANCE TO ME IR JIST BEAUTIFUL THEY MAKE ME HAPPY I JUST ENJOY THEM AM MUSIC IS A COMPLICATEHING IN LABORATORIES BECAUSE IT'S A SHARED SPACE SO HEADPHONES OR THE GENERAL REQUIRONMENT BUT HAVING EITHER SILENCE IF YOU LOVE SILENCE AND I HAPPEN TO LIKE WORKING IN SILENCE OR LISTENING TO CERTAIN FORMS OF MUSIC I DO ALSO USE THE FORTY HURTS A BY NORO BEATS OR I PARTICULARLY LIKE LISTENING TO A GLEN GOULD WHILE I WORK OR LISTENING TO WHALE SONG BELIEVET A'RE NOT WHILE I WORK BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY STRUCTURE THAT I CAN FOLLOW AN DON'T SPEAK WHALE AND SO I CAN'T FOLLOW BUT I FORFILLS THE SPACE IN A WAY THAT I FIND PLEASANT AND I'VE PUT SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF EFFORT INTO MAKING MY LABORATORY SPACES IN MY OFFICE SPACES MY WORK SPACES NICE PLACES TO BE NOW I HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THIS WORK FROM DOCTOR MANDAGE AND OTHERS OF THE TIME WHEN I DID THAT BUT WHAT I FOUND WAS THAT OVER THE YEARS I I WAS A CHALLENGED IN MAINTAINING A KIND OF ELEVATED MOOD WHILE WORKING IN A LABORATORY NOT BECAUSE I DIDN'T THOROUGHLY ENJOY THE WORK I LOVE DOING EXPERIMENTS WITH MY HANDS AND I LOVED BEING IN LAB BUT AT LEAST THE LABS THAT I WAS IN AS A GRADUATESUNION POSTOCK THERE WERE NO WINDOWS SO I WASN'T GETTING ADEQUATE SUNSHINE THE WINDOWS THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE DIDN'T OPEN SO I WASN'T GETTING A LOT OF FRESH AIR AND SO ON AND SO FORTH SO I'VE PERSONALLY FOUND IT VERY VALUABLE TO CREATE AND ENVIRONMENT BOTH AT WORK AND AT HOME THAT I FIND ESTHETICALLY PLEASANT AT LEAST IN SOME WAY OR ANOTHER AND I REALIZE PEOPLE HAVE VERYING LEVELS OF CONTROL A OVER THE AESETIC ENVIRONMENT CERTAINLY THE AUDITORY ENVIRONMENT CAN BE CONTROLLD NOWADAYS THROUGH THE US OF HEADPHONES IF YOU'RE ALLOWED TO USE THOSE SO FOR INSTANCE USING MUSIC OR USING BACKGROUND SOUND THAT YOU FIND VERY PLEASANT COMBINED WITH A CONCERTED EFFORT ON YOUR PART TO CREATE STATES OF HAPPINESS BY HOPEFULLY DOING WORK THAT'S MEANINGFUL TO YOU OR AT LEAST IS LEADING TO MEANINGFUL OUTCOMES WILL TALOLOBIT MORE ABOUT THAT BUT THESE HAPPINESS INVENTORIES ALSO TURN OUT TO BE INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT SOURCES OF CREATING SO CALLED SYNTHETIC HAPPINESS AND WE WILL ALSO TALK ABOUT OTHER WAYS THAT ONE CAN CREATE ELEVATED LEVELS OF SYNTHETIC HAPPINESS AND I REALIZE THE WORD SYNTHETIC PROBABLY DRAWS UP CONNOTATIONS OF FALSE HAPPINESS OR CONTRIVED HAPPINESS I WISH INSTEAD OF CALLING IT SYNTHETIC HAPPINESS THEY CALLED IT A SELF CREATED OR SELF DIRECTED HAPPINESS OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT CAUSE THET IT WOULDN'T SOUND AS FALSE BECAUSE IT IT'S SIMPLY NOT FALSE IT LEADS TO THE SAME AS FAR AS WE KNOW IDENTICAL NEUROCHEMICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL STATES OF HAPPINESS IS T NATURAL HAPPINESS AND MIGHT EVEN BE MORE PERSISTENT THAN NATURAL HAPPINESS IS CERTAINLY IS MORE UNDER OUR CONTROL BUT THE KEYP POINT IS THAT ENVIRONMENT END SELF DIRECTED WORK AT BEING HAPPY ARE BOTH IMPORTANT AND THEY INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER SO YOU'R SOMEBODY WHO HAS A HARD TIME SYNTHESIZING HAPPINESS THROUGH ANY OF THE METHODS THAT WE TALK ABOUT TODAY DON'T CONSIDER YOURSELF DEFICIENT IT COULD VERY WELL BE THAT THE ENVIRONMENT THAT YOUARE IN SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT OR PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT OR AUDITORY ENVIRONMENT IS SIMPLY NOT CONDUCIVE TO SYNTHESIZING HAPPINESS AND FOR THAT REASON I THINK THE WORK OF CHILLING MANDAGE AND COLLEAGUES  AND OTHERS IN THE FIELD IS TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REMOVES US FROM THIS A PRESSURE TO JUST SYNTHESIZE HAPPINESS FROM WITHIN DESPITE OR CIRCUMSTANCES I THINK YON MANY OF US OF HEARD OF THE INCREDIBLE A STORIES OF PEOPLE LIKE VICTOR FRANKIL OR A NELSON MANDELLA WHO WERE STRIPPED OF THEIR FREEDOM AND YET MANAGED TO MAINTAIN SOME SENSE OF POSITIVE ANTICIPATION OR AT LEAST SOME SENSE OF IDENTITY THAT ALLOWED THEM TO STILL ACCESS FORMS OF HAPPINESS THOSE ARE HIGHLY UNIQUE SITUATIONS OF COURSE AND THEY SPEAK TO THE THE POWER OF THE OF THE HUMAN PSYCHE FOR SYNTHESIZING HAPPINESS AND CERTAINLY FOR SYNTHESIZING A SENSE THAT THERE MIGHT BE A FUTURE AND TO LIVING TO THAT FUTURE IN IN THEIR CASES INCREDIBLY IMPRESSIVE WAYS BUT I THINK FOR MOST EVERYBODY THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WEREIN HAS A POWERFUL IMPACT ON OUR MOOD AND SOME PEOPLE MORE THAN OTHERS AN I KNOW PEOPLE THAT ARE PERFECTLY HAPPY WITH BLANK WALLS NO PICTURES ON THE WALLS OTHER PEOPLE BENEFIT TREMENDOUSLY FROM HAVING PHOTOES OR PLANTS IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT AND SO ON YOU REALLY HAVE TO DETERMINE WHAT'S NEEDED FOR YOU AND DO YOUR BEST TO TRY AND PLACE THOSE THINGS INTOU ENVIRONMENT OR RATHER PLACE YOURSELF INTO AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS CONDUCIVE TO YOU SYTHESIZING YOUR HAPPINESS IN FACT THE POWERFUL INTERACTION BETWEEN OUR ENVIRONMENT IN OUR OWN ABILITY TO GENERATE CERTAIN KINDS OF EMOTIONS IS WELL ESTABLISHED NOT JUST FOR HAPPINESS BUT FOR THINGS LIKE GRATITUDE SO FOR INSTANCE THERE'S A CLASSIC STUDY FROM AIMS A M YES IN TWO THOUSAND FOR THAT WHAS FOCUST ON GRATITUDE WE'VE HAD AN EPISODE ON GRATITUDE BEFORE AN THE BASIC TAKE AWAY OF THT EPISODE IS THAT IT TURNS OUT RECEIVING GRATITUDE IS A MORE POWERFUL STIMULUS FOR THE RELEASE OF NARRO CHEMICALS AND ACTIVATION OF BRAIN AREAS ASSOCIATE WITH SO CALL PROSOCIAL BEHAVIORS AND FEELINGS A WELL BEING INCLUDING HAPPINESS BUT ALSO OBSERVING STORIES IN THE FORM OF MOVIES OR BOOKS ARE OTHER NARRATIVES OF OTHER PEOPLE RECEIVING HELP IS ALSO A VERY POWERFUL STIMULUS FOR GRATITUDE ALSO GIVING GRATITUDE IS VERY POWERFUL BUT NOT AS POWERFULS RECEIVING GRATITUDE LEAS THUT SOT THE RESEARCH AS OR OBSERVING POWERFUL EXCHANGES OF GRATITUDE BETWEEN OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHAT THE STUDY FROM AIM SHOWED IS THAT GRATITUDE AS A STATE OF MIND AND AS AN EMOTION DOES NOT EXIST IN A VACUUM IT'S NOT INDEPENDENT OF OUR SURROUNDING SO FOR INSTANCE JUST WRITING DOWN ALL THE THINGS YOU ARE GRATEFUL FOR WHILE IT HAS SOME POSITIVE IMPACT THE IMPACT OF THAT OR RECEIVING GRATITUDE OR OBSERVING GRATITUDE IS FAR MORE PPOTENT RI BIGGER INCREASES IN HAPPINESS AND FEELINGS O WELL BEING AND INDEED NORRO CHEMICALS AND ACTIVATION OF BREENARR IS ASSOCIATED WITH HAPPINESS AND WELL BEING WHEN THERE'S A RESS OF PROCITY WHEN THE PERSON RECEIVING IT IS UNDERSTAND SOMETHING ABOUT THE PERSON THAT'S GIVING TO THEM AND UNDERSTAND TOT THE PERSON IS GIVING GENUINELY FOR INSTANCE SO THERE'S AN ENVIRONMENTAL INTER ACTIONS NOT JUST ABOUT RECEIVING ITS RECEIVING FROM SOMEBODY THAT YOU KNOW GENUINELY WANTS TO GIVE AND LIKEWISE FOR THE GIVER IN THAT EQUATION THE FEELINGS OF WELL BEING ARE FAR GREATER WHEN THE THE PERSON RECEIVING WHATEVER IT IS MONEY FOOD ASSISTANCE IN SOME FORM OR ANOTHER COULD BE IUNO PHYSICAL ASSISTANCE ET CETERA WHEN THE GIVER HAS KNOWLEDGE THAT THE PERSON RECEIVING IT GENUINELY NEEDED THE THING THAT THEY ARE RECEIVING SO THE IMPORTANT FINDING WITHIN THE RESEARCH AGAIN AND AGAIN IS THAT HAPPINESS DOESN'T EXIST IN A VACUME IT'S PARTIA LAY OUR OWN RESPONSIBILITY TO SYNTHESIZE HAPPINESS ANDI WAS TOLD THAT MANY TIMES YOU LIKE HAPPINESS IS IN YOUR HEAD WELL YES INDEED IT'S IN YOUR HEAD BUT IT'S ALSO DEPENDENT ON INTERACTIONS WITH YOUR ENVIRONMENT PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT AND SO ON LIKEWISE GRATITUDE IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN CREAT INSIDE OF US I THROUGH GRATITUDE LISS AN APPRECIATION OR WE CAN GIVE BOTH POWERFUL SOURCES OF EVOKING NOR CHEMICAL CHANGES ASSOCIATE WITH GRATITUDE AND HAPPINESS AND WELL BEING BUT IT TOO DOESN'T EXIST IN AVAPPIU THERE IS A MUCH GREATER POSITIVE EFFECT WHEN WE HAVE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHI THE GIVER IS GIVING US SOMETHING OR THAT THE PERSON RECEIVING SOMETHNG IS GOING TO BENEFIT TREMENDOUSLY FROM RECEIVING IT SO I'M HIGHLIGHTING THIS BECAUSE I THINK THAT WHEN WE HEREABOUT SYNTHETIC HAPPINESS THEREIS A A KIND OF AUTOMATIC A RACING OF CONTEXT THAT TENDS TO OCCUR IN FACT A FEW A WERE TO PERUSE THE VARIOUS VIDIOS ON LINE OR PAPERS THAT EXIST ON PUBMET AAROUND HAPPINESS AN SYNTHETIC HAPPINESS IN PARTICULAR YOU WOULD COME AWAY WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT SYNTHETIC HAPPINESS IS JUST SOMETHING THAT WERE SPUST TO SNAP OUR FINGERS IN ACCESS OR PERHAPS DO VERY SPECIFIC THINGS IN ACCESS BUT WHILE THAT IS TRUE CONTEXT REALLY MATTERS AND I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THAT THE POINT NEEDS TO BE MADE THAT WHILE MONEY DOESN'T BUY HAPPINESS MONEY CAN BUFFER STRESS AND CERTAINLY OFFER OPPORTUNITIES THAT CAN PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR MORE HAPPINESS I THINK WE O ARE STRYING TO ARRIVE AT A GENERAL THEME HERE WHICH IS THAT NOTHING RELATED TO OUR MOOD EXISTS IN ISOLATION AND IN FACT THAT LEADS ME TO A DISCUSSION OF ONE OF THE MAJOR SCIENTIFIC FINDINGS IN THE REALM OF WHAT SORTS OF MIND SETS IN BEHAVIORS CAN IN FACT LEAD TO HAPPINESS AND THIS IS A PAPER THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT EVEN THOUGH THAT MIGHT SEEM LIKE A WHILE AGO IT FORMS THE BASIS FOR A LARGE AMOUNT OF LITERATURE THAT FOLLOWED IT'S A VERY INTERESTING LITERATURE THIS IS WORK FROM A ELIZABETH DONE AND COLLEAGUES AND WAS PUBLISHIN THE JOURNAL SCIENCE AGAIN IS ONE OF THE OR THREE APEX JERNALS NATURE SCIENCE SELL I ALWAYS SAY IS FOR THE O SUPERBOLE AND BE A CHAMPIONSHIPS AN STANDLI CUP OF SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHING VERY VERY STRINGENT IN TERMS OF O THE NUMBER OF PAPERS THEY LET IN VERY FEW THAT IS AND THE TILE THIS PAPER MAKES FAIRLY OPIESS WHAT THE PAPER IS ABOUT THE TITLE OF THE PAPER IS SPENDING MONEY ON OTHERS PROMOTES HAPPINESS AND I KNOW A NUMBER OF YOU POBABLY HEAR THAT TITLE AND THINK OBOY HERE WE GO HE'S GOIN TO TELL US THAT GIVING AWAY ALL OUR MONEY IS GOING TO MAKE US HAPPIER THAN RECEIVING MONEY AND I PROMISE YOU THAT IS NOT WHAT I AM GOING TO TELL YOU BUT NONE THELESS THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING STUDY AND IT'S ONE THAT I THINK THAT WE REALLY OUGHT TO PAY ATTENTION TO BECAUSE WHAT THE STUDY IS BASED ON IS THE FACT THAT INCOME PROVIDED ONE'S INCOME MEETS A CERTAIN LEVEL OF BASIC NEEDS INDEED HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE ONLY A WEAK EFFECT ON OVER ALL HAPPINESS O K SO QUOTING FROM THE PAPER IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH QUOTE INCOME HAS A RELIABLE BUT SURPRISINGLY WEAK EFFECT ON HAPPINESS WITH IN NATIONS WITH THE NATIONS JUST MAIN THEY LOOK TO THIS IN NOT JUST THE UNITED STATES BUT A NUMBER OF OTHER PLACES AS WELL PARTICULARLY ONCE BASIC NEEDS ARE MET O CASESO IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN WHAT ASPECTS OF MONEY AND HAVING MONEY ARE RELATED TO HAPPINESS CERTAINLY THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE A LOT OF MONEY WHO ARE VERY HAPPY SERTAINLY THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE VERY LITTLE MONEY WHO ARE VERY HAPPY AND OF COURSE THE REVERSE IS ALSO TRUE THERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE VERY MUCH MONEY WHO ARE UNHAPPY AND IN FACT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE A LOT OF MONEY WHO ARE VERY UNHAPPY A POINT THAT WHENEVER O IT'S MADE OFTEN WEO THOSE WITH LESS MONEY TOO UNROLL THEIR EYES BECAUSE THE ASSUMPTION IS MORE MONEY DOES INCREASE HAPPINESS AND IN FACT IT DOESN'T AND A LATER WILL GET BACK TO THIS IDEA OF WHETHER OR HOW ONE ACQUIRED THEIR MONEY HAS ANY IMPACT ON WHETHER OR NOT THAT MONEY INCREASES THEIR HAPPINESS OR NOT CLET'S CON YOUREMARK THAT FOR LATER IN THE MEANTIME LET'S TALK A LTTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE FINDINGS IN THIS PAPER THIS PAPERS INTERESTING BECAUS WHAT IT ID IS EXPLORED SOME THING CALLED PROSOCIAL SPENDING PROSOSES PENDING IS A PHENOMENON WHERE PEOPLE ARE TAKING A CERTAIN PORTION OF THEIR INCOME AND THEY ARE GIVING IT TO OTHERS OFTEN FOR CAUSES OR FOR THINGS THAT THEY THINK ARE IMPORTANT TO SEE HAPPEN IN THE WORLD OR CHANGE IN THE WORLD THAT COULD BE  YOU KNOW A HUNGRY INDIVIDUAL HAVING ACCESS TO FOOD OR MEDICAL CARE IT COULD BE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CAUSES IT COULD BE O FOR ANIMAL WELLNESS COULD BE FOR ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS IT COULD EVEN BE GIVING SOMEBODY MONEY SO THAT THEY CAN BUY THEMSELVES A GIFT OR GIVING SOMEBODY MONEY AND NOT HAVING UNANY SCUSE ME UNDERSTANDING OR EXPECTATION OF WHAT THEYRE GONG TO DO WITH THE MONEY K AGAIN ONE OF THE CENTIRAL THEMES AROUND GRATITUDE IS THAT WELL RECEIVING IS GREAT GIVING IS ALSO GREAT IN TERMS OF INCREASING SENSE OF WELL BEING AND ONE OF THE MORE IMPORTANT FEATURES TO THAT IS WHEN WE GIVE EITHER IN THE FORM OF WORDS OR IN THE FORM OF RESOURCES KNOWLEDGE THAT THE PERSON RECEIVING BENEFITS FROM THAT IN SOME REAL WAY GREATLY INCREASES THE CHANCE THAT THERE IS AN INCREASE IN HAPPINESS FOR THE GIVER AS WELL AS THE RECEIVER AGAIN THAT'S A NOTE ABOUT GRATITUDE BUT NOT AN INSIGNIFICANT ONE AS IT RELATES TO THE STUDY SO WHAT THIS STUDY FOUND WAS THAT HIGHER PROSOCIAL SPENDING WHAS A SOCIATE WITH SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER HAPPINESS AS WAS A VERY STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT AND THEY FOUND THAT THE EFFECTS OF INCOME AND PROSOCIAL SPENDING WERE INDEPENDENT AND SIMILAR IN MAGNITUDE OK INDEPENDENT AND SIMILAR MANGEDALL EXPLAIN WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THOSE VIEW THAT  MIGHT BE CONFUSED BY THAT STATEMENT IN JUST A MOMENT WHEREAS QUOTE PERSONAL SPENDING REMAINED UNRELATED TO HAPPINESS SO WHAT THIS STUDY BASICALLY FOUND WAS IF PEOPLE ARE A LOTTED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY TO GIVE AWAY AND ONE ADJUST FOR OVER ALL INCOME RIGHT AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT FOR SOME INDIVIDUAL GIVING AWAY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS MIGHT EPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THEIR YEARLIER MONTHLY INCOME AND FOR ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL IT MIGHT REPRESENT A TINY FRACTION OF THEIR INCOME BUT WHEN YOU ADJUST FOR INCOME LEVEL WET YOU FIND IS THAT PEOPLE WHO GAVE AWAY MONEY BENEFITED TREMENDOUSLY IN TERMS OF THEIR OWN INCREASE IN HAPPINESS IN FACT QUOTE EMPLOYS WHO DEVOTED MORE OF THEIR BONESSES TO PROSOCIAL SPENDING THAT IS GIVING WAY MORE MONEY EXPERIENCE GREATER HAPPINESS AFTER RECEIVING THE BONUSS AND THE MANNER WHICH THEY SPENT THAT BONUSS WAS A MORE IMPORTANT PREDICTOR OF THEIR HAPPINESS THAN THE SIZE OF THE BONUSS ITSELF THIS WAS AN ACTUAL EXPERIMENT THEY RAN WITH REAL INCOME REAL MONEY IMNRY THAT AGAIN JUST TO MAKE SURE IT HITS HOME BECAUSE I FOUND THIS TO BE REALLY IMPACTFUL EMPLOYS WHO DEVOTED A GREATER FRACTION OF THEIR BONUSS TO PROSOSIAL SPENDING THAT IS GIVING AWAY MONEY TO OTHERS EXPERIENCE GREATER HAPPINESS AFTER RECEIVING THE BONUSS AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY SPENT THAT BONESS WAS A MORE IMPORTANT PREDICTOR OF THEIR HAPPINESS THAN THE SIZE OF THE BONUSS ITSELF SO THE ACTUAL BONESS THE RECEIVING OF THE MONEY LED TO GREATER INCREASES IN HAPPINESS IF THEY GAVE IT AWAY AND THE ACT OF GIVING IT AWAY ITSELF LED TO GREATER INCREASES IN HAPPINESS THEN RECEIVING THE BONUES SO IT'S A TUFER AS YOU MIGHT SAY SO THAT TAKE AWAY FROM THIS STUDY AND STUDIES LIKE IT THING IS PRETY OBVIOUS THAT AM TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN AND AGAIN WHEN I SAY TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN THIS MEANS WHATEVER PERCENTAGE OF OUR OWN INCOME THAT WE CAN AFFORD TO GIVE AWAY OR IF WE DON'T HAVE INCOME THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR EFFORT RIGHT OM N THIS WAS ABOUT MONEY BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT EFFORT WE CAN HELP OTHERS RIGHT YOU CAN SERVE IN A FOOD KICHINS YOU CAN DO AM  COMMUNITY GARDENING YOU CAN AM PICK UP TRASH YOU CAN DO ANY NUMBER OF OF THINGS YOU CAN ASSIST A NEIHBOR WITH CHILD CARE OR UN ASSIST A NEIGHBOR WHO IS A PHYSICALLY LESS ABLE TO RETRIEVE THEIR PAPER AT CETERA AT CETERA IT THAT THE POINT IS THAT GIVING RESOURCES CERTAINLY IN THE FORM OF MONEY BUT ALSO IN THE FORM OF EFFORT AND TIME IS IMMENSELY BENEFICIAL FOR SYNTHESIZING OUR OWN HAPPINESS THAT IS FOR THE GIVER US TO INCREASE OUR LEVELS OF HAPPINESS BUT THE DEGREE OF IINCREASE IN OUR OWN HAPPINESS IS PROPORTIONAL IN SOME WAY TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PERSON RECEIVING ACTUALLY NEEDED THAT HELP AND REGISTERS THAT HELP EXCELLENT RESEARCH ALSO POINTS TO THE FACT THAT ANOTHER POTENT WAY TO SYNTHESIZE HAPPINES THAT IS TO CREATE GENUINE STATES OF HAPPINESS IN OURSELVES IS TO LEVERAGE THE SO CALLED FOCUS SYSTEM OR RATHER I SHOULD SAY TO DE EMPHASIZE THE TENDENCY OF OUR MINDS TO WANDER THERE'S AN EXCELLENT PAPER ON THIS ALS O PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL SCIENCE THIS IS NOW A CLASSIC PAPER I TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT IN THE EPISODE ON MEDITATION BUT FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DID OR PERHAPS DIDN'T HEAR THAT EPISODE I JUST ONT OFD BRIEFLY TOUCH ON A FEW ASPECTS OF THE PAPER AND IN PARTICULAR A FEW ASPECTS OF THE PAPER THAT I DIDN'T TALK ABOUT PREVIOUSLY AND THE TITLE THIS PAPER AGAIN IS A VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD IN TERMS OF TELLING YOU WHAT IT'S ABOUT AND THAT IS A WANDERING MIND IS AN UNHAPPY MIND BY KILLINGSWORTH AND GILBERT THIS PAPER WAS PUBLISH IN SCIENCE IN TWENTY TEN AND WE WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO THE PAPER THIS IS FRANKLY A VERY INTERESTING PAPER THIS PAPER INVOLVED SEVERAL THOUSAND SUBJECTS OR I SHOULD TAY TWENTY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY ADULT SUBJECTS AND WHAT THEY WERE ABLE TO DO WAS TO CONTACT THESE SUBJECTS WHILE THEY WERE GOING ABOUT LIVING THEIR DAILY LIVES AND ASKD THEM BOTH WHAT THEY WERE DOING AND WHAT THEY WERE FEELING SOME ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THAT THEY ASKED THEM BUT THEY WERE ABLE TO ESTABLISH WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE WERE WATCHING TELL A VISION ARE DOING HOUSEWORK OR IM WORKING ON A HOME COMPUTER OR RESTING OR LISTENING TO MUSIC ET CETERA IN THEIR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT SO THIS IS OUTSIDE THE LABORATORY AND THEY WERE ABLE TO ASSESS TO WHAT EXTENT THOSE PEOPLE OR HAPPY OR UNHAPPY OR NEUTRAL OR HAD SOME OTHER EMOTIONAL STATE AT THE TIME WHEN THEY WERE ENGAGING IN ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES AND THEY ASSESSED WHETHER OR NOT THOSE INDIVIDUALS WERE ALSO FOCUSSED ON OR FOCUSSED AWAY FROM WHATEVER ACTIVITY THEY WERE ENGAGING IN AND THE TAKE WAYS FROM THE STUDY ARE MANY BUT FORSAKE OF TO DAY'S DISCUSSION WHAT I THINK IS ESPECIALLY INTERESTING IS THAT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE WERE ENGAGING IAN ACTIVITIES THAT THEY ENJOYED OR NOT THE TENDENCY FOR THEIR MIND TO WANDER FROM AN ACTIVITY PREDICTED LOWER LEVELS OF HAPPINESS THAN IF THEY TENDED TO BE FOCUS ON THE ACTIVITY THEY WERE ENGAGED IN NOW THAT ITSELF SHOULD BE SURPRIS MIN WHAT THAT SAYS IS THAT EVEN IF SOMEBODY WAS ENGAGED IN ACTIVITY LIKECLEANING THEIR HOUSE OR DOING HOME WORK OR READING SOMETHING THAT THEY WEREN'T ENJOYING IF THEY WERE FOCUSED ON WHAT THEY WERE DOING THEY TENDED TO REPORT AS HAPPIER THAN IF THEIR MIND WAS DRIFTING ELSEWHERE THIS ALSO POINTS TO THE IDEA THAT PERHAPS OUR MINDS DRIFT TO UNPLEASANT THOUGHTS MORE THAN PLEASANT THOUGHTS BUT THEY ALSO ADDRESSD THAT IN THE STUDY PHEN I LIKE TO MAKE HERE IS QUOTE ALTHOUGH PEOPLE'S MINDS WERE MORE LIKELY TO WANDER TO PLEASANT TOPICS THEN TO UNPLEASANT TOPICS AND THERE THAT THE DIFFERENCE IS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT PEOPLE'S MINDS TENDED TO WANDER TO PLEASANT TOPICS ABOUT FORTY THREE PER CENT OF THE TIME AS SUPPOSED TO UNPLEASANT TOPICS ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN PER CENT OF THE TIME OR TO NEUTRAL TOPICS IN THE REMAINING THIRTY ONE PER CENT OF THE SAMPLES PEOPLE WERE NO HAPPIER WHEN THINKING ABOUT PLEASANT TOPICS THAN ABOUT THEIR CURRENT ACTIVITY THINK ABOUT THAT PEOPLE WERE NO HAPPIER THAN WHEN THINKING ABOUT PLEASANT THINGS THAN THEIR CURRENT ACTIVITY IN FACT THE MERE FOCUS ON WHAT THEY WERE DOING WAS MORE POWERFUL THAN ANYTHING ELSE EVEN IF THEY DIDN'T ENJOY WHAT THEY WERE DOING SO THEY GO ON HERE TO SAY QUOTE ALTHOUGH NEGATIVE MOODS ARE KNOWN TO CAUSE MINE WANDERING ANALYSY STRONGLY SUGGESTED THAT MINE WANDERING WAS GENERALLY THE CAUSE THE CAUSE AND NOT MERELY THE CONSEQUENCE OF UNHAPPINESS ANDSO THERE A LOT OF ASPECTS OF THIS STUDY THAT ARE WORTH GOING INTO BUT THE MAJOR TAKE AWAY OR THE ONE THAT PERHAPS WE SHOULD ALL BE MOST CON CERNED WITH IS THAT WHEN WE ARE NOT FOCUSED ON WHAT WE ARE DOING WE TEND TO BE FAR LESS HAPPY THAN WHEN WE ARE FOCUSED ON WHAT WE ARE DOING EVEN IF WHAT WE ARE DOING IS SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T DEEM VERY PLEASANT AND CERTAINLY IF WE ARE ENGAGED IN SOMETHING THAT WE CONSIDER VERY PLESENT AND WE ARE VERY FOCUSED ON WILL THEN ARE LEVELS OF HAPPINESS ARE THE HIGHEST THAT SORT OF OPPINES BUT WHAT THIS REALLY SPEAKS TO IS THE TREMENDOUS POWER OF BUILDING OUR ABILITY TO FOCUS ON WHAT WE'RE DOING AND TO STAY PRESENT TO WHAT WE ARE DOING NOW THES WHOLE NOTION OF STAYING PRESENT IS ONE THAT ITSELF IS A LOBIT COMPLICATED AND IN THE EPISODE ON MEDITATION I TALK TO LITEBIT ABOUT WHETHER NOT ITS BENEFICIAL TO BE PRESENT TO OUR INTERNALS STATE OR THAT IS OUR IN TERRECEPTIVE STATE YOU KNOW OUR FEELINGS OF OUR HEART RAED AND HOW FULL OR EMPTY ARE GOT FEELS OR THE OUR STATE OF BEING FROM OUR SKIN INWARD OR WEATHER OR NOT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON BEING PRESENT TO THINGS IN OUR IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS BOTH OURE VERSIONS OF BEING QUOTINPRESENT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE BUT IN THE ONE CASE WERE FOCUSED INTERNALLY IN THE OTHER WERE FOCUS EXTERNALLY AND OF COURSE MOST THE TIME IT'S SOME COMMINATION OF THE TO BUT WHAT THIS STUDY REALLY SAYS IS THAT ANY PRACTICE THAT CAN POWERFULLY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO REMAIN PRESENT IN THE ACTIVITY WE ARE ENGAGED IN THAT COULD EVEN BE A PHONE CALL COULD BE TEXTING FOR THAT MATTER COULD BE SOCIAL MEDIA FOR THAT MATTER RIGHT WE'RE NOT PLACING JUDGEMENT ON THE ACTIVITY HERE IN FACT WHAT WERE REALLY TALKING ABOUT IS THE ENORMOUS HAPPINESS INCREASING VALUE OF BEING PRESENT TO WHAT WE'RE DOING REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE ARE DOING AND THE PRACTICE THAT'S KNOWN TO BE BENEFICIAL FOR INCREASING OUR ABILITY TO FOCUS IS AMONG OTHER THINGS A SHORT MEDITATION PRACTISE IN FACT WORK FROM WHEN HE SEZUKI'S LABIT AND WHY YOU AGAIN WHEN HE AS BEEN A GUEST ON THIS PODCAST HER LABORATORY IS SHOWN THAT EVEN A VERY BRIEF MEDITATION OF ABOUT THIRTEEN MINUTES AND THIS WOULD BE THE QUOTIN CLASSIC TYPE OF MEDITATION OF EYES CLOSED FOCSING ON ONE'S BREATHING EVEN A VERY BRIEF MEDITATION OF JUST THIRTEEN MINUTES OR SO DONE CONSISTENTLY SO IDEALLY EVERY DAY BUT YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT EVEN IF YOU SKIP A DAY THEARE STILL BENEFITS THAT SORT OF MEDITATION CAN GREATLY ENHANCE ONE'S ABILITY TO FOCUS AND AND HER STUDIES THAT WAS ALSO SHOWN THAT SORT OF BRIEF MEDITATION COULD ALSO GREATLY ENHANCE A MOOD AND SLEEP AND VARIOUS ASPECTS OF COGNTIVE PERFORMANCE AND WORK FOR MY LABORATORY IN CLABORATION EN DOCTOR DAVIDSPEAGLE AT STAMFORD DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIETRY IS SHOWN THAT EVEN BRIEFER MEDITATIONS OF EVEN JUST FIVE MINUTES PER DAY CAN HAVE FAIRLY OUTSIZED POSITIVE EFFECTS ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PRAMITERS AS WELL THOSE VERY BRIEF TYPES OF MEDITATIONS BEC OES THEY REALLY ARE FOCUSING AND MORE ACCURATELY I SHOULD SAY REFOCUSING EXERCISES WHEN YOU DO THAT SORT OF ACTIVITY OF CLOSING YOR EYES AND FORCING YOURSELF TO FOCUS AND REFOCUS ON YOUR BREATH AND INTERNAL STATE THAT IS DIRECTING YOUR PERCEPTION INWARD OR IF YOU CHOOSE YOU COULD DELIBERATELY FOCUS YOUR PERCEPTION ON SOME EXTERNAL OBJECT OR SOUND FOR THAT MATTER WHEN ONE DOES THAT THES CIRCUITS OF THE BRAIN INVOLVED IN FOCUS DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE THAT IS THE REWIRE AND INCREASE THEIR ABILITY FOR YOU TO ACHIEVE FOCUS MANY OF US HAVE HEARD ABOUT MEDITATION MANY OF US THINK ABOUT MEDITATION AS A MINDFULNESS EXERCISE MINDNESSING QUOTES CAUSE AT ITSELF NEEDS DEFINITION BUT I PREFER TO VIEW MEDITATIONS OF THE SORT THAT I JUST DESCRIBED AS PERCEPTIAL OR FOCUS BASE TRAINING WHICH IS REALLY WHAT THE DATEA POINT TO NOTIONS ABOUND CONSCIOUSNESS AND STATES OF MINE ARE VERY HARD TO DEFINE BUT IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT EVEN A FIVE MINUTES O DAY OR IDEALLY AND UPTO A THIRTEEN MINUTE DAY MEDITATION CANGREATLY INCREASE OUR ABILITY TO FOCUS AND BASED ON THE FINDINGS IN THIS PAPER A WANDERING MINE IS UNNHAPPY MIND ALSO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THE ABILITY TO REFOCUS AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIND ON WHAT WE'RE DOING THROUGHOUT OUR DAY REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE'RE DOING CAN HAVE A VERY DRAMATIC IN FACT A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE ON ARE LEVELS OF OVER ALL HAPPINESS SO WHAT ELSE DOES THE RESEARCH TELL US WE CAN DO TO INCREASE OUR LEVELS OF GENUINE HAPPINESS WELL IT'S VERY CLEAR BASED ON THE LOGITUDAL STUDY FROM HARVARD AS WELL AS THE YALE HAPPINESS PROJECT AND THE WORK OF NUMEROUS LABORATORIES IN THE U S AND ELSEWHERE THAT QUALITY SOCIAL CONNECTION IS EXTREMELY POWERFUL IN TERMS OF IT'S ABILITY TO INCREASE ARE LEVELS OF HAPPINESS WHAT IS QUALITY SOCIAL CONNECTION QUALITY SOCIAL CONNECTION FALLS INTO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT BENS THIS CAN BE ROMANTIC CONNECTION THIS CAN BE FRIENDSHIP THIS CAN EVEN BE CO WORKER OR JUST DAILY SUPERFICIAL INTERACTION TYPE CONNECTIONS THAT'S SURPRISING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE HEAR QUALITY SOCIAL CONNECTION AND THEY THINK DEEP CONVERSATION BUT IT'S VERY CLEAR FROM THE RESEARCH THAT OFTENTIMES ARE CONVERSATIONS WITH PEOPLE THAT WE ARE CLOSEST TO ARE ACTUALLY QUITE SHALLOW IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IF YOU'VE BEEN A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP OR A FRIENDSHIP FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME OR MAY BEVEN A SIBBLING RELATIONSHIP OR OTHER FAMILY RELATIONSHIP MUCH OF WHAT YOU TALK ABOUT IS FAIRLY SUPERFICIAL OR FAIRLY TRIVIAL IN FACT IT'S OFTEN A SHARING OF THE TRIVIAL DAY TO DAY THINGS BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE OR THROUGH GROUPS OF PEOPLE THAT LEADS TO THE FEELING THAT PEOPLE ARE REALLY CONNECTED TO ONE AN ANOTHER IN PARTICULAR IF IT'S INVOLVING SHARED EXPERIENCES OF ANY KIND GOOD OR BAD SO THERE'S AN EXTENSIVE LITERATURE ON SOCIAL CONNECTION AND HOW TO BUILD SOCIAL CONNECTION THIS CERTAINLY SHULD BE THE TOPIC OF A FULL EPISODE OF THIS P TCAST IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE BUT BECAUSE SOCIAL CONNCTION CAN HAVE SUCH A POWERFUL IMPACT ON OUR STATES OF HAPPINESS AND OVERALL WELL BEING ONE O EMPHASIZE A FEW FEATURES OF SOCIAL CONNECTION THAT I THINK MOST PEOPLE MIGHT NOT APPRECIATE ONCE AGAIN WHEN WE HEAR QUALITY SOCIAL CONNECTION I THINK MOST OF US TEND TO THINK ABOUT DEEP MEANINGFUL CONVERSATION OR LONG WALKS ON THE BEACH OR CAMPING TRIPS TOGETHER OR TRAVEL TOGETHER AND WHILE ALL OF THOSE CERTAINLY QUALIFY AS WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITIES FOR SOCIAL CONNECTION OPPORTUNIES FOR QUALITY SOCIAL CONNECTION ARE CERTAINLY NOT LIMITED TO THOSE KINDS OF INTERACTIONS IN FACT I CAN RECALL TIMES IN MY GRADUATE CAREER SO THIS WOULD BE TIMES WHEN I WAS LIVING IN THE LABORATORY AS I WAS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION F MY CRADUATE YEARS AND ONE OF THE MORE IMPORTANT SOCIAL CONNECTIONS FOR ME WAS THE STAFF THAT WORKED THERE IN THE WE HOURS OF THE NIGHT AND THAT CAME IN VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING SO ONE OF THE MORE REGULAR SOCIAL CONNECTIONS I HAD AS I WOULD BRUSH MY TEETH IN THE HALLWAY BATH ROOM AND WAS NO ONE ELSE REALLY ROUND AT THAT TIME EXCEPT FOR THE JANITORS THAT TENDED TO LEAVE EARLY IN THE MORNING THEYD WORKED A GOOD PORTION OF THE NIGHT OR THAT WERE ARRIVING VERY EARLY IN THE DAY AND THE FACT THAT I WOULD SEE THEM ON OUR REGULAR BASIS AND MAY BE EXCHANGE A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE WORK OR THEIR FAMILIES OF THE HOLIDAYS I SH FOR ME BECAME VERY MEANINGFUL IN PART BECAUSE MY SOCIAL CONNECTIONS OF THE TIME WERE REALLY LIMITED TO ONLY SOCIAL CONNECTIONS THAT I HAD IN THE CONTEXT OF WORK NOW SOME PEOPLE MIGHT LOOK AT MY SCHADUL AT THAT TIME AND LOOK AT MY LIFE AT THAT TIME AND SAY THAT WAS VERY UNHEALTHY YOU KNOW YOU WERE LACKING IN CERTAIN NUMBER OF WAYS BUT FRANKLY LOOKING BACK AND AT THET TIME AND I KNOW THIS BECAUSE I JOURNALD AT THE TIME I WAS EXCEEDINGLY HAPPY AT LEAST FOR THAT STAGE OF MY LIFE AT THAT STAGE OF MY LIFE I WANTED TO BE FOCUSD PRIMARILY ON DOING EXPERIMENTS AND IMMERCING MYSELF IN MY SCIENTIFIC TRAINING AND FOR ME THE EVEN SEEMINGLY INSIGNIFICANT INTERACTIONS OF TALKING TO THE JANETOR IN THE MORNING OR SOME OF THE OTHER REGULAR STAFF WAS NOT INSIGNIFICANT IN FACT FOR ME IT WAS VERY SIGNIFICANT AND OVER THE HOLIDAYS WHEN THEIR HOURS WERE REDUCED I SHAE MISSED THEM QUITE A LOT AND EVEN AS I TALK ABOUT THIS I CAN RECALL THE FEELINGS OF WELL BEING OF JUST SEEN FAMILIAR FACES AND THAT BRINGS UP AN IMPORTANT POINT WHICH IS THERE'S A QUITE EXTENSIVE LITERATURE POINTING TO THE FACT THAT WHEN WE SEE FACES ESPECIALLY FACES IN THE MORNING AND IN THE LATE AFTERNOON THERE IS A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE EMOTIONAL CIRCUITRY OR I SHOULD SAY THE CIRCUITRY OF THE BRAIN THE UNDER LIES EMOTIONAL WELL BEING AND THAT SHOULDN'T COME AS SURPRISING WE AS OLD WORLD PRIMATES MUCH LIKE OTHER PRIMATES ARE VERY DEPENDENT ON FACES AND FACIAL EXPRESSIONS IN TERMS OF REGISTERING OUR OWN AND OF PLACIN LIFE AND OUR EMOTIONAL STATE NOW THE ORIGINS OF THIS ARE MANY AND PARTICULAR WE HAVE A BRAIN AREA IT'S C I SHOLD CALL THE FUSIFORM FACE GYRUS THE ISNAREA OF THE BRAIN THAT WAS LARGELY DISCOVERED BY WOMEN BY NANCY CANWISSURE AT AMITEE AND THE C ANWISHER LAB HAS DONE EXTENSIVE WORK SHOWING THAT THIS BRAIN AREA THAT'S DEDICATED TO THE PROCESSING EF FACES AND NOT JUST FACES IN REAL LIFE BUT FACES ON COMPUTER SCREENS AND ELSEWHERE ARE INTIMATELY TIED TO AREAS OF THE BRAIN THAT ARE ASSOCIATE WITH EMOTIONALITY THAT SIC HAULD WORK FROM ANOTHER LABORATORY DO OUR SALVES LABORATORY CALTEC NOW T OU SEE BIRKLY HAS SHOWN THAT THIS FACE PROCESSING AREA IN THE BRAIN IN BOTH NON HUMAN PRIMATES AND PRIMATES IS DIRECTLY LINK TO THE AREAS OF OUR BRAIN THAT ASSOCIATE WITH ANXIETY AND FEAR BUT ALSO AREAS OF THE BRAIN THEIR ASSOCIATE WITH WELL BEING SO IT COMES IS NO SURPRISE THAT WHEN WE SEE FACES IN PARTICULAR FRIENDLY FACES EVEN IF WE HAVE JUST BRIEF INTERACTIONS WITH THOSE FACES AND EVEN IF NO WORDS ARE EXCHANGED THAT CREATES THE SENSE OF SOCIAL BOND AND IT CREATES THE SENSE OF PREDICTABILITY AND I RAISE THIS AGAIN BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT SOCIAL CONNECTION ALWAYS HAS TO COME IN THE FORM OF CLOSE FRIENDSHIPS WHICH WHICH OF COURSE ARE WONDERFUL ARE CLOSE ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS WHICH OF COURSE ARE WONDERFUL OR CLOSE FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS WHICH OF COURSE ARE WONDERFUL BUT AS WILL SOON DISCUSSING A IN OUR MODEL OF HAPPINESS OR HOW TO ACHIEVE HAPPINESS BASED ON THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE IN A FEW MINUTES SOCIAL CONNECTION CAN AND SHOULD COME IN VARIOUS FORMS AND WHEN I SAY VARIOUS FORMS I MEAN FORMS OF BRIEF INTERACTION MORE SUPERFICIAL INTERACTION AND FORMS OF DEEPER INTERACTION ALL OF THOSE ARE RELEVANT TO OUR STATES OF HAPPINESS AND THERE'S RESEARCH TO SUPPORT THAT DAILY INTERACTIONS WITH SOMEBODY AT A CAFE OR JUST A BRIEF HELLO OR A SMILE PROVIDED THAT WE ARE BOTH PRESENT ERE WE MAKE THE EFFORT TO BE PRESENT TO THOSE INTERACTIONS HOWEVER BRIEF THEY ARE CAN HAVE A POSIVE EFFECT ON PEOPLES OVERELL WELL BEING AND NOT JUST IN THAT MOMENT BUT CONSISTENTLY EVIDENCE BY THE FACT I THINK THAT WHEN I LOOK BACK ON THOSE YEARS OF WORKING LONG HOURS IN THE LABORATORY AND ESSENTIALLY RESTRICTING MYSELF EITHER TO EXERCISING SLEEPING EATING OR WORKING AGAIN THAT'S WHAT I WANTED AT THAT STAGE OF MY LIFE CERTAINLY NOT THO WAY LIVE MY LIFE NOW BUT THAT'S WHAT I WANTED THAT STAGE OF MY LIFE THAT EVEN THOSE SEEMINGLY INSIGNIFICANT SOCIAL INTERACTIONS WERE IMPORTANT TO ME AND HAD A POTENT IMPACT ON INCREASING MY LEVEL OF HAPPINESS AND FRANKLY STILL DO AND I FEEL THAT RIGHT NOW THAT SAID I THINK ALL OF US CAN APPRECIATE THE IMMENSE VALUE OF SOCIAL CONNECTION THAT IS OF THE MORE LONG LASTING AND FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD RICHER TYPE WHETHER OR NOT THAT IS WITH SIBLINGS OR WITH PARENTS ERE WITH FRIENDS OR WITH ROMANTIC PARTNERS FOR THAT REASON I WANTED EMPHASIZE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT CONSTITUTES CONNECTION AND WHAT CONSTITUTE SOCIAL CONNECTION THERE ARE BASICLLY TWO FORMS OF SOCIAL CONNECTION THAT HAVE BEEN STUDIED AND I'LL REVIEW BOTH AS IT RELATES TO INCREASING OUR LEVELS OF HAPPINESS AND THE FIRST ONE IS PRESENTS AND E CONTACT AND THE SECOND IS PHYSICAL CONTACT SO IN TERMS OF PRESENTS IN I CONTACT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF STUDIES ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE EXCHANGE DIRECT EY CONTACT DURING CONVERSATION OR NOT DICTATING WHETHER OR NOT EACH INDIVIDUAL IN THAT INTERACTION FEELS AS IF THEY HAD A CONNECTION NOW AGAIN KEEP IN MIND THAT WHILE WE THINK OF CONNECTION AS RELATING TO SOME DEEP OR MEANINGFUL CONVERSATION AND OFTENTIMES THAT CAN BE THE CASE THINK OUT FOR INSTANCE AN EXCELLENT THERAPIST A PATIENT RELATIONSHIP WERE AN EXCELLENT ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP WERE AN EXCELLENT FRIENDSHIP WHERE YOU REALLY FEEL HEARD AND UNDERSTOOD OR AT LEAST TO THE EXTENT THAT PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO EXPLORE CERTAIN TOPICS WITH YOU YOU'RE WILLING TO HEAR THEM AND LISTEN REALLY CAREFULLY FOR WHAT THEY'RE SAYING AND THERE WILING TO HEAR AND LISTEN TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AN ATTEMPT TO UNDERSTAND THAT CERTAINLY CAN ENHANCE THE SENSE OF SOCIAL CONNECTION LEADING TO WHAT PEOPLE WOULD CALL SOCIAL BONDS LEADING TO INCREASED HAPPINESS BUT  CONTACT IS ALSO KNOWN TO BE AN IMPORTANT FEATURE THE THING ABOUT I CONTACT IS THAT MOST PEOPLE ASSUME THAT A LOT OF I CONTACT AND IN FACT ONGOING I CONTACT IS CRITICAL TO A SENSE OF CONNECTION AND IFFACT THAT'S NOT THE CASE THERE'S A RECENT PAPER THAT I FIND REALLY INTERESTING THAT WAS PUBLISHIN PROCEEMGS IN THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE TITLEOTIST PAPER IS I CONTACT MARKS THE RISE AND FALL OF SHARED ATTENTION IN CONVERSATION I FIND THIS PAPER INTERESTING FOR NUMBER REASONS FIRST OF ALL MY LABORATORY WORKS ON INTERNAL STATES AND VISION SO IT RELATES DIRECTLY TO THE WORK OF MY LABORATORY DOES BUT ALSO THAT IT VIOLATES WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A GENERAL RULE OF SOCIAL CONNECTION WHICH IS IS IDEA THAT TWO PEOPLE NEED TO BE FOCUSSED ON ONE ANOTHER THAT IS LOOKING AT ONE ANOTHER DIRECTLY AND FAIRLY CONSISTENTLY THROUGHOUT A CONVERSATION IN ORDER FOR THE FEELING OF CONNECTION TO EMERGE BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE AND IN FACT JUST TO GIVE YOU THE TAKE AWAY AND THEN ALL FLESH ET OUT ALOBIT WITH SOME DATA I CONTACT OR I SHOULD SAY MUTUAL I CONTACTS AT TWO PEOPLE REGISTERING THE PRESENCE OF THE OTHER PERSON LOOKING AT THEM YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME AND I'M LOOKING AT YOU FOU'RE WATCHING THE SUN YOU TO PERHAPS WE ARE ACTUALLY DOING THIS AT THAT MOMENT IF YOU'RE LISTENING JUST KNOW THE'M LOOKING DIRECTLY INTO THE CAMERAS I'M SAYING THIS AT THIS MOMENT IF WE WERE TO BE LOOKING DIRECTLY AT ONE ANOTHER THAT IT TURNS OUT SIGNALS THE NEXT STEP WHICH IS THAT IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT WE WILL EACH BOTH LOOK AWAY AND THAT TURNS OUT TO BE A WAY IN WHICH WE SET AND RESET ATTENTION CONTINUALLY DURING CONVERSATION AGAIN I REALLY LIKE THIS STUDY BECAUSE OF THE HI FIDELITY THE HI TEMPORAL PRECISION THAT IS THE PRECISION OVERTIME AT WHICH THEY LOOK AT I CONTACT AND ENGAGEMENT OF ATTENTION BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THEY DO THIS BI LOOKING T THINGS LIKE PEOPLE SIZE AND OF COURSE WHERE THE EYES WERE LOOKING AND SO ON AND SO FORTH THE BASIC TAKE AWAY OF THE STUDY WAS THE FOLLOWI N HERE I'M QUOTING FROM THE STUDY QUOTE RATHER THAN MAXIMISING SHARED ATTENTION GOOD CONVERSATION MAY REQUIRE SHIFTS IN AND OUT OF SHARED STATES ACCOMPANIED BY I CONTACT SO IT THIS BASICALLY SAYS IS THAT WHEN TWO PEOPLE ARE INVOLVED IN A VERY LET'S CALL IN AN INTIMATE CONVERSATION BUT THE WORD INTIMATE SHOULD NOT BE MIS CONSTRUDE TO MEAN SOMETHING ABOUT INTIMACY OR SEXUAL INTIMACY OR PHYSICAL INTIMACY JUST A CONVERSATION IN WHICH BOTH PEOPLE FEEL PRESENT TO THE CONVERSATION AND FOCUSED ON THAT CONVERSATION IN THAT CONVERSATION AND ITS CONTENTS ONLY THET TENDENCY IS FOR PEOPLE TO TAKE TURNS TALKING ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES DEPENDING ON THE INDIVIDUALS THEY MIGHT INTERRUPT MORE OR LESS AGAIN INTERRUPTING CAN BE A SIGN OF INTEREST IT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAVE TO BE RUDE BY THE WAY BUT THEIR SHARING INFORMATION HOPEFULLY ABOUT A COMMON TOPIC OR SET OF TOPICS THEY WILL AT SOME MOMENT LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER SO THE STUDY SHOWS AND THAT AFTER BRIEFLY GAZING DIRECTLY AT ONE ANOTHER ATTENTION PIKES AND THEN THEY WILL LOOK AWAY AND ATTENTION WILL GET REDUCED AND THEN THE CONVERSATION CONSISTS OF A SERIES OF FOCUSSING BACK ON ONE ANOTHER WITH THEIR EYES AND THEN FOCUSSING OFF FOCUSSING ON IN FOCUSSING OFF AND THOSE MUTUAL I CONTACT MOMENTS ACTUALLY PREDICT THE BREAKING OF ATTENTION SO THAT TIS RAMPING UP OF ATTENTION AND BREAKING OF ATTENTION RAMPING OF ATTENTION AND BREAKING OF ATTENTION I THINK THESE ARE IMPORTANT RESULTS BECAUSE THEY VIOLATE THE STEREOTYPE OR ASSUMPTION THAT DEEP SOCIAL CONNECTION OF THE SORT LEADING TO HAPPINESS ALWAYS INVOLVES ON GOING I CONTACT OR ON GOING FOCUS JUST AS WITH MEDITATION JUST AS WITH ANY ACTIVITY FRANKLY WE UNDERGO SHIFTS IN ATTENTION IN FOCUS THAT IS FOCUS RAMPS UP AND THEN IT BREAKS AND THEN IT RE ENGAGES IT RAMPS UP IT BREAKS AND THEN IT REENGAGES AND THAT IT TURNS OUT IS THE BASIS OF INDEPTH CONNECTED CONVERSATION SO FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE INTERESTED IN CREATING SOCIAL CONNECTION IN ANY CONTACT AND IN PARTICULAR FORSAKE OF INCREASING HAPPINESS BECAUSE IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT SOCIAL CONNECTIONS EVEN IF THEY ARE FAIRLY SUPERFICIAL SOCIAL CONNECTIONS CAN INCREASE SOR SENSE OF HAPPINESS SEEING FACES IS IMPORTANT IDEALY FACES IN PERSON ALTHOUGH I SUPPOSE THESE DAYS OVERZUME OR OVER ON OTHER SCREENTIPE MEDIUM WOULD WOULD BE A CLOSE SECOND BUT THE POINT IS THAT IF YOU WANT TO INCREASE HAPPINESS YOU NEED TO HAVE QUALITY SOCIAL CONNECTIONS AND IF YOU ONT HAVE QUALITY SOCIAL CONNECTIONS YOU NEED TO BE PRESENT AND ENGAGE IN THOSE SOCIAL CONNECTIONS AND THAT REQUIRES A VIEWING OF EACH OTHER'S FACIS IDEALLY WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT A PHONE CUALLER TEXA CHANGE CAN'T BE MEANING FUL BUT THAT FACES ARE REALLY TEMOST POWERFUL WAY TO ENGAGE IN SOCIAL CONTACT AND THAT I CONTACT NOT CONSIST IN I CONTEBUT I CONTENT OF THE SORT THAT BUILDS UP AND THEN BREAKS AND BUILDS UP AND BREAKS ACROSS THE INTERACTION IS GOING TO BE THE BEST WAY THAT WE ARE AWARE OF TO FEEL THAT ONE HAD A REAL CONNECTION THIS SHOULD ALSO REMOVE ANY PRESSURE THAT YOU MIGHT FEEL TO CONSTANTLY LOOK AT SOMEBODY OR TO BE COMPLETELY EYES OPEN STARING AT THEM WITHOUT BLINKING OR DIVERTING OR ATTENTION IN ANY POINT JURING AR CONVERSATION THIS ALSO FRAN ALLY IS AN OPPORTUNITY WHERE IF SOMEBODY SAYS AY YOU'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION BECAUSE YOU LOOK AWAY THAT YOU MAY ACTUALLY BE ENGAGING IN WHAT IS THE MORE TYPICAL FORM OF HEALTHY CONNECTION I TALKED ABOUT THIS LONG AGO ON AN EPISODE ABOUT FOCUS AND TURNS OUT WHEN WE ARE LISTENING VERY INTENTLY TO SOMEBODY AND TRYING TO REMEMBER THE INFORMATION THEIR TELLING US WE WILL OFTEN CLOSE OUR EYES AND THAT'S NOT A FORM OF LACK OF ATTENTION THAT'S A ACTUAL FORM OF ATTENDING IN BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MUCH OF OUR BRAIN DEVOTED TO VISION WHEN FORTY PER CENT OF OUR BRAIN IS DEVOTE DIVISION IN SOME WAY OR ANOTHER WHEN WE CLOSE OUR EYES WE CAN ACTUALLY DEVOTE MORE ATTENTIONAL RESOURCES TO MEMREMEMBERING THE SPECIFICS OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE TELLING US BUT AGAIN PLEASE DON'T GO THROUGH CONVERSATIONS WITH YOUR EYES CLOSE THE ENTIRE TIME I THINK THAT WOULD CERTAINLY NOT BE CONCONDUCIVE TO BUILDING SOCIAL CONNECTION SO WE KNOW THAT FACES ARE IMPORTANT FOR SOCIAL CONNECTION AS IT RELATES TO SYNTHETIC HAPPINESS AND WE KNOW THAT I CONTACT IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR BUILDING SOCIAL CONNECTION PHYSICAL CONTACT IS ALSO IMPORTANT FOR SOCIAL CONNETION AND NOT JUST ROMANTIC OR SECTUAL TYPE CONNECTION IN FACT THERE IS A FORM OF PHYSICAL CONNECTION THAT IS PRESENT IN OTHER PRIMATES IN FACT ITS PRESENT AS FAR AS WE KNOW IN ALL MAMMELS AND IS ALSO VERY MUCH A FEATURE OF THE HUMAN NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THAT SOMETHING CALLED ALO GROOMING TO IMAGINE THAT MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY HAVEN'T HEARD OF ALO GROOMING THE RESEN BRINGING UP ALOGROOMING IS THAT IT STEMS FROM A FAIRLY EXTENSIVE LITERATURE ABOUT THE PROSOCIAL PRO HAPPINESS EFFECTS OF PETS ON HUMANS IN FACT IF YOU WANT A READ UP ON THIS THERE IS A PAPER AM OUT OF YELE UNIVERSITY ON THIS TOPIC THOUS PUBLISH IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE TITLE THE PAPER IS THE INFLUENCE OF INTERACTIONS WITH DOGS ON AFFECT A GA EMOTION ANXIETY AN AROUSAL IN CHILDREN AND IT REFERENCES SOME OTHER STUDIES THAT WERE PERFORMED ON HUMANS AND THE BASIC TAKE AWAY AM IS THAT THE SO CALLED A A AS ANIMAL ASSISTED ACTIVITIES A REPRESENT A REALLY POTENT WAY TO INCREASE PEOPLE INCLUDING CHILDREN'S FEELINGS OF WELL BEING NOW WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS TO ME IS THAT DOGS THEMSELVES DON'T REALLY HAVE TO DO MUCH EXCEPT BE PRESENT IN THE ROOM IN ORDER FOR THESE POSIVE EFFECTS THAT IS THE REDUCTIONS AN ANXIETY INCREASES IN HAPPINESS ET CETERA TO OCCUR IN INFFACT THEY CAN BE VERY VERY BRIEF AS THEY DESCRIBIN THE PAPER BRIEF UNSTRUCTURED INTERACTIONS WITH AN UNFAMILIAR DOGS YOONLY LY LE TO  NOW THIS DOG AFTER EXPOSURE TO A MODERATE STRESSER SHOWED HIGHER POSIVE AFFECT RELEVANT PERSICIPANTS RECEIVED A SOOTHING OBJECT OR WAITED FOR THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME SO JUST EVEN SEEING A DOG FOR A BRIEF AMOUNT OF TIME HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE STRESS AND IMPROVE HAPPINESS OR I SHOULD A INCREASE FEELINGS OF HAPPINESS OVER ALL THEN A CHILD RECEIVING A SOOTHING OBJECT WHICH AT LEAST FOR ME A LITL BIT COUNTER INTOITIVE I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT CHILDREN RECEIVING A SOOTHING OBJECT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE MORE POWERFUL A STIMULUS BUT IN FACT IT WASN'T AT LEAST NOT IN THIS STUDY THE REAL QUESHION I THINK WE SHOULD BE ASKING OURSELVES IS WHAT IS IT ABOUT INTERACTIONS WITH OTHERS AND WITH OTHER ANIMALS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE THIS PROSOSIAL HAPPINESS ENHANCING A FACT AND THE REASON I RAISE THIS IS ALSO BECAUSE I THINK MANY PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN EITHER OWNING OR HAVING INTERACTIONS WITH PETS AS A WAY TO IMPROVE THEIR FEELINGS SO WELL BEING AND I SAY HAVING INTERACTIONS WITH BECAUSE I MYSELF I'M A GOOD EXAMPLE SOMEBODY WHO WASN'T ALWAYS A ABLE TO HAVE PETS SO WHEN I WAS A GRADUATE SOON IN A POST OCK I VERY MUCH WANTED A DOG VERY VERY VERY MUCH WONT A DOG IN FACT THERE WAS A RULE IN MY FAMILY AT SOME POINT THAT I WASN'T ALLOW TO TALK ABOUT DOGS ANY MORE BECAUSE I WAS TALKING ABOUT ALL THE BREEDS OF DOGS GOING TO DOG BREEDERS EXAMINING DIFFROM REEDS GOING TO THE POUND ET CETERA THE POINT IT WAS THAT I WAS OBSESSED WITH GETTING A DOG BUT I KNEW I WASN'T IN A GOOD POSITION TO OWN A DOG YET I DIDN'T HAVE THE FINANCES I DIDN'T HAVE THE CORRECT LIVING SITUATION AND SO ON EVENTUALLY I DID OWN A DOG OF COURSE BUT AT THE TIME I COULDN'T SO WHAT I WOULD DO IS EVERY SUNDAY I WOULD GO TO A PLACE WHERE THEY FOSTER DOGS AND THEY NEED DOG WALKERS AND I WOULD WALK THEIR DOG I WOULD ALSO WALK MY NEIGHBORS DOGS I DIDN'T CHARGE THEM FOR IT IN FACT I FELT LIKE I WAS GET BEING PAID BY GETTING TIME WITH THOSE DOGS IN FACT I PUT IN ADD AT THAT TIME ON CRAGSLESS THAT I WOUL WALG PEOPLE'S DOGS FOR FREE AND ONLY A FEW PEOPLE TOK THAT SERIOUSLY BUT OF THE ONES THAT DID I HAD A GREAT U CAGER OF DOG OWNERS THAT WOULD ALLOW ME TAKE THEIR DOGS OUT AND I WAS SUPERHAPPY IT JUST MADE ME VERY VERY HAPPY AND I REALLY ENJOYED IT UM I'M FRENKLY AM IT WAS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO ALSO GET TO KNOW THE VARIOUS DOG BREEDS AND THE DIFFERENT DOG TEMPERAMENTS AND TO LEARN A BIT ABOUT MY ABILITY TO INTERACT WITH DOGS IN IN A CERTAIN WAY ACTUALLY GOT TO BE A PRETTY GOOD DOG WALKER UNFORTUNATE LATER I GOT A BULLDOG IN IT TURNS OUT NO MATTER HOW GOOD A DOG WALKER YOU ARE BULDOGS JUST SIMPLY DON'T LIKE TO WALK IN FACT IF YOU'VE EVER WALKED UP TO A BULLDOG AND YOU'V OFFERED TO SCRATCH OR PET THAT DOG YOU'LL NOTICE THAT BULLDOGS LOVE THAT AND I WOULD ARGUE HAVING BEEN A BULDOG OWNER THAT THEY LIKE IT BECAUSE IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO STOP MOVING BUT THAT'S MORE ABOUT THE BULLDOG THAN WHAT I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU NEXT WHICH IS THIS PRINCIPLE OF SO CALLED ALLO GROOMING ALLO GROOMING IS A PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR THAT'S OBSERVED IN ESSENTIALY ALL MAMMALS BUT VERY STRONGLY IN NON HUMAN PRIMATES AN PRIMATES WHERE INDIVIDUALS WITHIN A SPECIES TOUCH ONE ANOTHER AND THIS IS NONSECTUAL TOUCH SO THIS WOULD BE AM SOMEONE BRUSHING SOMEBODY ELSE'S HAIR OR COMBING THEIR HAIR OR EVEN USING A LINT ROLLER ON THEM FOR INSTANCE OR AM SOME ONE GROOMING SOMEBODY ELSE NOT TYPICALLY ONE NEEDS TO HAVE AN ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIP WITH THIS PERSON SO IT COULD BE A PROFESSIONAL TYPE RELATIONSHIP WHERE THIS IS A BARBER CUTTING SOMEBODY'S HAIR OR HAIR DRESS OR AM CUTTING SOME A ERE STILING SOMEBODY'S HAIR IT COULD BE SOMEBODY GIVING SOME ONE A MANICURE PETICURE TO BE SOMEBODY DOING SKIN CARE MASAGE FOR SOMEBODY IN IN A PROFESSIONAL CONTACT OR COULD BE TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE AGREED THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE C ONTEXT THAND FOR THE RELATIONSHIP FOR ONE PERSON TO BE GROOMING SOMEBODY ELSE S CAN EVEN BELIEVE OR NOT THERE'S LITERATURE ON THIS THIS CAN EVEN EXTEND INTO THE REALM OF PEOPLE SORT OF CLEANING AND PICKING OFF OTHER PEOPLE NOW WHEN WE SEE THIS AND PRIMATES IT SEEMS LIKE A VERY CUTE AND A EVE ALMOST UNDERSTANDABLE BEHAVIOR WE CAN SEE THESE PICTURES ON LINE F YOU LOOK THEM UP YOU CAN JUST LOOK UP ALO GROOMINE YOU'LL SEE A VAST NUMBER OF PICTURES OF FOR INCIS BABOONS PICKING LITTLE THINGS OUT OF EACH OTHERS A HAIR OR UM A GROOMING AND KIND OF PERUSING ONE ANOTHER TO FIND THING AS PRESUMELY PARASITES ARE LIKE LITLE BITS OF PLANTS ARE SOMETHING LIE THAT THAT THEY ONE O REMOVED FROM THEM ALO GROOMING IS KNOWN TO STIMULATE A CERTAIN CATEGORY OF NURONS CALLED THE SEA TACTILE FIBRS THESE ARE A PARTICULAR CATEGORY OF SO CALLED CENSORY NURONS THAT INERVATE OUR SKIN SO THERES A LITERLLY LIKE LITTLE ENDINGS OF OF NURANS LO WIRES THAT END UP IN THE SKIN THAT WHEN THEY ARE TOUCHED LIGHTLY TEND TO CREATE A FEELING OF WELL BEING IN THE PERSON THAT'S BEING TOUCHED AGAIN THIS IS CONSENTUAL TOUCH THAT'S VERY CONTEXT APPROPRIATE BUT IT'S KNOWN TO INCREASE LEVELS OF OXY TOSEN A AND A HORMON SLASH NER O TRANSMITTER IT'S BOTH REALLY A THAT IS KNOWN TO EVOKE FEELINGS OF BONT OF BOND OR OF AF FEELING BONDED TO SOMEBODY OR SOME THING AND FOR MANY PEOPLE WE HEAREABOUT OXY TOSEN AND WE THINK ABOUT A BOND BETWEEN PARENT AND CHILD IN PARTICULAR MOTHER AND INFANT WHERE IT'S BEEN MOST EXTENSIVELY STUDIED OR BETWEEN TWO MEMBERS OF A ROMANTIC COUPLE BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE LITERATURE ON ALOGROOMING WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT WHEN HUMANS GROOM ONE ANOTHER THE INCREASES IN OXY TOSEN THAT ARE EXPERIENCED ARE AT LEAST ON PAR WITH AND IN FACT MORE OFTEN MORE DRAMATIC IN RESPONSE TO ALOGROOMING THEN IN RESPONSE TO OTHER FORMS OF TOUCH SO THE POINT HERE IS THAT ALOGROOMING IS A PROSOCIAL BEHAVIOR THAT TENDS TO A SOCIATE WITH AND PROMOTE FEELINGS A WELL BEING AND HAPPINESS AND THIS IS NOT A TRIVIAL EFFACT IF YOU LOOK THE BRAIN IMAGING DATA OR OTHER FORMS OF DATE ON THIS ALOGROOMING IS A VERY POWERFUL FORM OF BONDING BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS THAT'S COMPLETELY NON VERBAL IN FACT MOST OFTEN IT DOESN'T INVOLVE EYE CONTACT I SUPPOSE TWO PEOPLE COULD BE LOOKING AT ONE ANOTHER GROOMING ONE ANOTHER BATYPICALLY THIS IS DONE FROM THE SIDE OR FROM BEHIND WHY DID I BRING UP THE PAPER OND PETS WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT WHEN HUMANS STROKE DOGS OR BRUSH THEIR DOGS OR STROKE CATS OR BRUSH THEIR CATS ET CETERA THAT IS A FORM OF HUMAN TO ANIMAL ALOGROOMING AND IT'S ONE IN WHICH BOTH THE PET AND THE HUMAN RECEIVE HUGE INCREASES IN OXY TOSEN AND OTHER RELATED NERO CHEMICALS THAT MAKE US FEEL BONDED I BRING THIS UP BECAUSE THE HARVORD LONGGITUNERAL STUDY ON HAPPINESS AND MANY MANY OTHERS IFNOT HUNDREDS OF OTHER STUDIES ON HAPPINESS POINT TO THE IMPORTANCE OF QUALITY SOCIAL CONNECTION A YOU HEAR THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN PEOPLE ON THEIR DEATH BEDS DON'T SAY THEY WHAT WHISH THEY HAD WORKED MORE PEOPLE ON THEIR DEATH BEDS TALK ABOUT THE RICHNESS OF SOCIAL CONNECTIONS OR THE WISH THAT THEY HAD INVESTED MORE IN SOCIAL CONNECTIONS I THNK A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK OF SOCIAL CONNECTIONS ONLY IN TERMS OF TRAVEL WITH OR A CONVERSATION WITH OTHERS BUT MUCH OF WHAT WE PERCEIVE AS DEEP SOCIAL CONNECTIONS ALSO INVOLVES PHYSICAL CONTACT AND THAT SOMETHING THAT'S DEEPER DEEPLY ROOTED SCUSE ME IN OUR EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY AND ITS PRESENT BOTH IN US AND IN NON HUMAN PRIMANTES END IT'S CLEAR THAT WE CAN ENGAGE IN THESE KINDS OF PRO SOCIAL NON VERBAL NON EE CONTACT TYPE BEHAVIORS THROUGH THINGS LIKE NONSECTUAL TACTILE TOUCH A KA A ALOGROOMING SO WE'VE BEEN TALKING OUT A NUMBER THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ONE CAN DO IN ORDER TO INCREASE LEVELS OF HAPPINESS AND CERTAINLY BEFORE WE CONCLUDE TO DAY I'M GOING TO TOUCH BACK IN TO NOT JUST SYNTHETIC HAPPINESS AND THE VARIOUS THINGS WE CAN DO SUCH AS PROSOCIAL SPENDING ALOGROOMING SOCIAL CONNECTION ET CETERA BUT ALSO THINGS RELATE TO HAPPINESS THAT INVOLVE FOCUS ON VOCATION AND WORK AND PURSUIT OF GOALS BECAUSE AS I MENTION AT THE BEGINNING THOSE ARE ALSO CRITICAL TO INCREASING OUR STATE OF HAPPINESS AND CERTAINLY OURE STATE OF SECURITY AND THE FEELING THAT WE CAN PROVIDE FOR OURSELVES AND PERHAPS FOR OTHERS AS WELL WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS NOTION OF CHOICE AND CHOICE IS AND WHETHER R NOT HAVING A LOT OF FREEDOM TO CHOOSE OR LIMITED FREEDOM IN CHOOSING WHAT WE DO AND WHAT WE GET AND WHAT WE ARE ABLE TO PURSUE IN LIFE HOW THAT RELATES TO BOTH NATURAL HAPPINESS AND SYNTHETIC HAPPINESS DAN GILBERT AND OTHERS HAVE EXPLORED THIS ISSUE OF FREEDOM OF CHOICE AND HOW IT RELATES TO HAPPINESS AND THERE I MUST SAY THE FININGS ARE INCREDIBLY COUNTER INTUITIVE BUT VERY VERY WELL SUPPORTED BY ALL OF THEIR DATA O'M GOING TO SUMMARIZE A LARGE AMOUNT OF THE STUDIES AT ONCE BY SAYING THE FOLLOWING DAN'S LABORATORY AND OTHER LABORATORIES HAVE DONE EXPERIMENTS WHERE THEY GIVE PEOPLE A SERIES OF OPTIONS IN ONE OF THE MORE CLASSIC EXAMPLES THEY GIVE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RATE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PAINTINGS OR PICTURES IN A SENDING OR DECEENDING ORDER OF PREFERENCE NOTHER WORDS THEIR DECIDING WHICH ONES THEY LIKE MOST WHICH ONES THEY LIKE LLEAST THEN WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THE EXPERIMENTOR WILL VARY THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY HAVE TO STICK TO THAT CHOICE SO THIS COULD BE STICKING TO THE CHOICE BY RECEIVING THAT PAINTING TO TAKE HOME OR IN ANOTHER EXPERIMENT IT WAS HAVING TO MAKE A CHOICE BETWEEN GIVING UP ONE PHOTOGRAPH THAT THEY THE THE RESEARCH SUBJECT TOOK OR ANOTHER PHOTOGRAPH THAT THEY TOOK ONE OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS WAS GOIN TO GO OFF TO A PUBLICATION ANOTHER ONE THEY COULD KEEP FOR THEMSELVES AND THE CONDITIONS IN THAT EXPERIMENT WERE EITHER THAT YOU HAD TO MAKE THE DECISION AND IT WAS FINAL THAT IS YOU COULD KEEP ONE AND RATE YOUR DECISION OR YOU COULD KEEP ONE AND THEN YOU HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SWAP OUT THAT PICTURE FOR THE OTHER ONE AT SOME LATER TIME IN OTHER WORDS THESE EXPERIMENTS REALLY WARNT ABOUT RATING PICTURES THEY WERE REALLY ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT CONSTRAINING YOUR CHOICE MEANING FORCING SOMEBODY TO MAKE A CHOICE AND STICK TO THAT CHOICE LED TO GREATER LEVELS OR LESSER LEVELS OF HAPPINESS AND SATISFACTION WITH THAT CHOICE AND WHAT THEY FIND CONSISTENTLY IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE HAVE AN ON GOING SET OF CHOICES IT LEADS TO REDUCE LEVELS OF HAPPINESS NOW THAT MIGHT COME AS SURPRISING TO MANY OF YOU BUT I WONE TO BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT HAVING A LOT OF CHOICES OF WHAT YOU LIKE MOST LEADS TO LESSER HAPPINESS AND THAT HAVING FEWER CHOICES ABOUT THINGS YOU DO OR OBJECTS YOU ACQUIRE IT CETERA LEADS TO GREATER HAPPINESS WHAT THIS SAID OF EXPERIMENTS REALLY POINTS TO IS THAT WHEN WE MAKE A CHOICE IF WE ARE FORCED TO STICK TO THAT CHOICE WE TEND TO BE FAR HAPPIER WITH THAT CHOICE THAN IF WE MAINTAIN THE OPTION TO CHANGE OUR MIND THE RESULTS OF THESE EXPERIMENTS ARE EXTREMELY INFORMATIVE I BELIEVE IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING OUR REAL LIFE HAPPINESS THAT IS HAPPINESS OUTSIDE THE LABORATORY BUT I THINK THEY ARE OFTEN MISUNDERSTOOD AS MEANING THAT IF WE HAVE A LOT OF CHOICES WE TEN TO BE LESS HAPPY THAN IF WE HAVE FEWER CHOICES THAT IS NOT THE CASE HAVING FREEDOM OF CHOICE IS TERRIFIC AND ACTUALLY CORRELATES WITH ELEVATED LEVELS OF HAPPINESS BUT ONCE WE MAKE OUR CHOICE IT'S CLEARLY THE CASE THAT KILLING ALL OTHER CHOICES OR HAVING ALL OTHER OPTIONS KILLED FOR US INCREASES OUR SATISFACTION WITH THE CHOICE THAT WE'VE MADE WHEREAS LEAVING DOORS OPEN LEAVING OPTIONS OPEN GREATLY DIMINISHES OUR SENSE OF SATISFACTION THIS HAS BEEN EXPORTED TO ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT DOMAINS SO THIS HAS BEEN EXPORTED TO THE DOMAIN OF MAKING CHOICES ABOUT WHAT COLLEGE TO GO TO OR WHAT PARTNER TO SELECT IN LIFE IN EVERY ONE OF THOSE INSTANCES WE SEE THAT OUR HAPPINESS WITH OUR CHOICE IS VERY MUCH RELATED TO THAT CHOICE BEING EITHER THE ONLY ONE OR ONE OF VERY FEW OTHER OPTIONS THEIR NUMBER OF DIFERENT WAYS TO INTERPRET THIS THROUGH THE LENDS OF NAURO SCIENCE WE MIGHT SAY THAT THE PREFRONTAL QUARTECS THE AREA OF THE BRAIN THAT'S INVOLVED IN DECISION MAKING AND EVALUATING DIFFERENT OPTIONS IS AN ARY OF THE BRAIN THAT'S VITAL FRANKLY TO OUR EVOLUTION AS HUMAN BEINGS INTO OUR DAILY LIFE INTO OUR WHOLE LIFE IT IS OF COURSE THE THING THAT ALLOWS US TO IT EVALUATE DIFFERENT RULE SETS TO CHANGE RULE SETS TO SWHICH CONTEXTS AN TO CREATE MEANING ET CETERA TO INTERPRET WHAT'S GOOD WHAT'S BAD BUT IT'S ALSO A FAIRLY COSTLY PROCESS MEANING IT'S VERY METABOLICALLY DEMANDING AND THE'S AN ENTIRE LITERTURE RELATED TO WHAT'S CALLED EGO DEPLETION THIS IS CERTAINLY A TOPIC FOR A FUTURE PO CASPODEGO DE PLETION ESSENTIALLY SAYS THAT IF I HAVE YOU ATTEND VERY A INTENSELY TO A GIVEN TASK FOR INSTANCE ASKING YOU TO COUNT BACKWARDS FROM A THOUSAND TO ZERO IN INCREMENTS OF THIRTEEN AND THEND HAVE YOU SWITCH ABOUT HALF WAY THROUGH THAT'S HARD FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IF I HAVE YOU DO THAT THEN YOUR ABILITY TO SUPPRESS IMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR AND TO DO A HARD COGNITIVE AR PHYSICAL TASK IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT IS ACTUALLY SUPPRESS THE SO CALLED EGODEPLETION RELATES TO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS BUT IT' CERTAINLY RELATES TO ENGAGEMENT OF THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX WHICH IS VERY METABOLICALLY DEMANDING SO I VALUATING CHOICES AND DOING COMPUTATION OF NUMBERS ARE ATTENDING TO THINGS WITH YOUR MIND AND FORCING YOURSELF TO FOCUS INTENSELY IS METABOLICALLY DEMANDING AND THAT'S A LIMITED RESOURCE THAT CAN BE RESET BY THINGS LIKE SLEEP AND NON SLEEP DEEP BREAST OR IDLE TIME OR LETTING YOUR MIND WANDER IN THAT CASE A POSITIVE MIND WANDERING TO ALLOW YOUR BRAIN TO RESET IT'S ABILITY OF FOCUS BUT THE OTHER THING THAT IT DOES IS IT IMPACTS THE REWARD CIRCUITRY OF THE BRAIN THE SO CALL DOPOMING REWARD CIRCUITRY AND OTHER REWARD CRCUITRYIES OF THE BRAIN AND AND HERE I'M PAINTING WITH A BROAD BRUSH BUT IT ESSENTIALLY DIVIDES THEM  SUCH THAT FOR INSTANCE IF A GIVEN CHOICE OF A LET'S AY A PARTNER OR MAY BE BUYING OURSELVES IN ARTICLE OF CLOTHING NOT THAT I WANT TO COMPARE YOU KNOW SELECTION OF AN A LIFE PARTNER TO SELECTION OF AN ARTICAL CLOTHING BUT JUST TO GIVE MULTIBLE EXAMPLES MIGHT GIVE US AND HER IT'S ARBITRARY UNITS IN EX UNITS OF DOPAMINE INCREASE WELL IF WE BY THAT ARTICAL CLOTHING OR WE SELECT THAT LIFE PARTNER AND THEN WE EMERGE FROM THE STORE OR THE WEDDING AND WE ARE FOCUSED ON WHAT WE PURCHASED FOR OURSELVES OUR CHOICE OR OUR LIFE PARTNER CHOICE AND ONLY THAT WELL THEN THERE'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF NURACHEMICAL REWARD ASSOCIATED WITH THAT AN HAPPINESS AN WELL BEING BUT IT'S ALSO VERY CLEAR THAT IF WE LEAVE THOSE CHOICES THE STORE ORTHER ARE WEDDING FOR INSTANCE WHERE LIFE WITH SOMEBODY FOR A MOMENT EVEN JUST MENTALLY AND START THINKING ABOUT THE OTHER OPTIONS THAT WE MIGHT ENTERTAIN AS POSSIBLE IF THOSE ARE STILL OPEN TO US IN REALITY OR IN OUR MIND WILL THEN A REWARD CIRCUITRY BECOMES FRACTURED IN A WAY NOT PHYSICALLY FRACTURED BUT LESS ATTENTION IS DEVOTED TO THE REWARD CIRCUITRY OF ASSOCIATE WITH OUR CHOICE AND AS A CONSEQUENCE INSTEAD OF BEING EX UNITS OF DOPOMINE IT'S EX DIVIDED BY HOW EVER MANY OTHERITHOICES WE MIGHT HAVE AVAILABLE TO US IN OUR MIND OR IN REALITY CASO INSTEAD OF AND AGAIN THESE ARE ARBITRARY UNITS BUT INSTEAD OF A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF REWARD IT'S A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF REWARD DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF OTHER OPTIONS THAT WE MIGHT BE CONSIDERING AS ALTERNATIVES TO WHAT WE CHOSE AND I THINK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF UNDERSTANDING HOW LIMITING OUR CHOICE IS AFTER WE'VE MADE THEM I IS A VITAL PART OF WHAT WE CALL SYNTHETIC HAPPINESS IN FACT WE COULD EVEN GO SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT FOCUSSING ON THE CHOICES WE'VE MADE AND REALLY INVESTING IN THOSE CHOICES AS GOOD ONES WERE GREAT ONES AND REALLY TRYING TO LIMIT OUR THINKING TO THE CHOICES THAT WE'VE MADE ONCE WE'VE MADE THEM IS PERHAPS ALSO IMPORTANT TO OUR NATURAL HAPPINESS BECAUSE IT'S SO INITSTRICTABLY INTWINED WITH WHAT WE THINK OF AS A GOOD LIFE AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS IF WE ARE CONSTANTLY IN A MODE OF A VALUTIVE DECISION MAKING EVEN AFTER WE'VE MADE A DECISION WE ARE NOT NOURACHEMICALLY NORH PSYCHOLOGICALLY ABLE TO EXTRACT THE FEELINGS OF HAPPINESS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CHOICE THAT WE MADE SO WEVE TALKED ABOUT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS OF HAPPINESS BOTH IN SYNTHETIC AN NATURAL HAPPINESS AND SOME OF THE MORE COUNTER INTUITIVE ASPECTS OF HAPPINESS FOR INSTANCE THAT PEOPLE TEND TO ADJUST THEIR LEVELS OF HAPPINESS NOT REGARDLESS BUT OFTEN IN SPITE OF THEIR LIFE SCIRCUMSTANCES BUT AS WE EMPHASIZE EARLIER IN THE EPISODE THAT IS NOT TO SAY AT LEAST THE RESEARCH DOES NOT DIRECTLY SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT A MAJOR TRAMA OR LOSS WON'T IMPACT OUR HAPPINESS IN FACT IT TENDS TO AND THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE ACCESS RESOURCES IN WORK DEVOTED TO OVERCOMING TRAMA WHICH CERTAINLY EXIST OUT THERE AND OF COURSE THERE ARE THE LONGITUDINAL STUDIES IN SHORT TERM STUDY SHOWING THAT INCOME LEVEL AND MATERIAL THINGS DON'T NECESSARILY SCALE WITH HAPPINESS AND VICE VERSA AND YET WE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE EARLY IN THE EPISODE THAT WHILE INDEED MONEY CAN'T BY HAPPINESS IT CAN BUFFER STRESS AND WHILE WORK DOESN'T NECESSARILY BRING HAPPINESS PER SAY WORK CAN BRING A TREMENDOUS FEELING OF MEANING AND RESOURCES WHICH CAN THEN PUT YOU INTO CONTACTS IN WHICH THINGS LIKE PROSOCIAL CONTACT AND ENHANCED BONDS AND CARETAKING OF OTHERS AND THERE OF YEW CAN BE ENHANCED SO IT WOULD BE UNFAIR AND IN FACT INACCURATE TO SIMPLY VIEW HAPPINESS THROUGH THE LENDS OF MONEY DOESN'T MATTER IT'S ALL ABOUT SOCIAL CONNECTION AND SO ON AND SO FORTH ABSOLUTELY SOCIAL CONNECTIONS IMPORTANT WHICH IS WHY WE SPEND SOME MINUTES TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE WAYS TO ENHANCE SOCIAL CONNECTION BOTH WITH OTHER HUMAN BEINGS AND OTHER ANIMALS AND THEM WITH US I THINK THERE'S A OPPORTUNITY HERE TO TAKE THE RESEARCH ON HAPPINESS THE RESEARCH ON THE NORROW SCIENCE OF WHAT HAPPINESS AND GRATITUDE AND PRO SOCIAL CONNECTION TELLS US AND TO COMBINE IT INTO A BIT OF A A MODEL OR A TOOL KIT IF YOU WILL AND I THINK INDEED THIS WILL BE A TOOL KIT IN ONE OF OUR FUTURE TOOL KIT EPISODES LIKELY MERGE WITH THE TOOL KIT ON GRATITUDE WHICH WE HAVEN'T DONE YET AND PERHAPS EVEN WE WILL DO AN ENTIRE EPISODE ON SOCIAL BONDS AND HAP TO ENHANCE ARE BUILD SOCIAL BONDS OR LEAST WHAT THE SCIENCE TELLS US ABOUT THAT IF WE TAKE A STEP BACK AND WE LOOK AT THE CONCEPT OF HAP PINESS WE CAN MAKE A COUPLE OF ABSOLUTE STATEMENTS THAT IS STATEMENTS THAT I THINK VERY FEW PEOPLE IF ANY WOULD CONTEST FIRST OF ALL THERE IS NO SINGLE MOLECULE OR CHEMICAL ASSOCIATE WITH HAPPINESS BUT THAT THE CHEMICAL MILLU OF THE BRAIN END BODY IS IMPORTANT FOR SETTING THE STAGE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR HAPPINESS HENCE WHY THERE ARE TREATMENTS AIMED AT LEAVIING DEPRESSION OR MANIA THAT TARGET CERTAIN OROCHEMICAL SYSTEMS IN HORMONE SYSTEMS HAPPINESS AT LEAST THE WAY OF I'M FRAMING IT TO DAY HAS ESSENTIALLY TOO COMPONENTS ONE IS MEANING THAT IS WHAT SORT OF MEANING DO CERTAIN TYPES OF INTERACTIONS OR BEHAVIORS COULD BE WORK COULD BE SOCIAL INTERACTIONS ET CETERA CARRY FOR US AND NESTED IN THAT IS THIS CONCEPT OF CONNECTION AND WE TALKED A BIT ABOUT TOOLS FOR INHANSING CONNECTION THINGS LIKE I CONTACT BUT NOT CONSTANT EYE CONTACT THINGS LIKE BEING VERY PRESENT TO A CONVERSATION OR AN ACTIVITY THAT YOU'RE ENGAGING IN REMEMBER WE TALKD ABOUT THE PAPER A DISTRACTED MIND IS AN UNHAPPY MIND THE PAPER PUBLISHED IN SCIENCE AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE STUDY ALSO PUBLISHD IN SCIENCE IN WHICH GIVING MONEY BUT ALSO KNOWING HOW THAT MONEY HAS POSITIVELY IMPACTED OTHERS LEADS TO THIS FEELING OF PRO SOCIAL CONNECTION AND HAPPINESS IN THE GIVER END IN THE RECEIVER AND I SHOULD MENTION AGAIN THAT IT'S NOT JUST TO GIVING A MONEY BUT ALSO THE GIVING OF EFFORT AND TIME AND ATTENTION THAT CAN HAVE SIMILAR EFFECTS SO WE HAVE MEANING AND CONNECTION AND A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO ACCESS THOSE AND THEN WE HAVE THIS ACCES THAT I'M REFERRING TO AS PERFORMANCE AND RESOURCES AND I'M TOK ABOUT PERFORMANCE IND RESOURCES AS IT RELATES TO NATURAL HAPPINESS NOT SYNTHETIC HAPPINESS BUT NATURAL HAPPINESS BECAUSE WE WOULD BE WRONG I BELIEVE F WE WERE TO SAY THAT INCOME DOESN'T MATTER I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY BASED ON THE RESEARCH THAT INCOME MATTERS AND INCOME THAT CAN COVER COSTS OF LIVING PLUFS THAT INCLUDES SOME BUFFER AND WHAT DO I MEAN BY BUFFER I MEAN BUFFER TO THE ANXIETY THAT CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT CHANGE IS IMPORTANT NOW THAT'S  GOING TO VARY FROM PERSON TO PERCON MEANING SOME PEOPLE WILL BE PERFECTLY HAPPY MAKING ONE DOLLAR MORE THAN THERE ABSOLUTE COST OF LIVING EVERY MONTH OTHER PEOPLE WILL REQUIRE A MORE SUBSTANTIAL BUFFER IN ORDER TO PROTECT THEM AGAINST THE NEGATIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF WORRYING ABOUT FOR INSTANCE INFLATION OR WORRYING THAT THEY MIGHT LOSE THEIR JOB AND THIS IS WHY I THINK MOST PEOPLE RECOMMEND HAVING IF POSSIBLE SOME BUFFER IN THEIR BANK ACCOUNT THAT COULD COVER TWO OR THREE OR MAYBE VEN SIX OR MAYBE IN TWELVE MONTHS OF LIVING EXPENSES WERE THEY TO LOSE THEIR JOB OR SOMETHING CATESTROPHIC HAPPEND TO THEM SO IF WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HAPPINESS I THINK IT'S ONLY FAIR ONLY ACCURATE AND FRANKLY ONLY RESPECT AL TO TALK ABOUT LIVING REQUIREMENTS AND COST OF LIVING REQUIREMENTS THAT INCLUDES THIS SORT OF BUFFER AND THAT THAT BUFF FORT ANXIETY IS GOING TO VERY DEPENDING ON HOW ANXIOUS SOMEBODY GETS ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF CATESTROPHIC THINGS HAPPENING TO THEM LIKE LOSING THEIR JOB OR THEIR RENT GOING OUPWARD DOUBLING AND HERE I 'M TALKING ABOUT HYPOTHETICALS BUT I THINK WE ALL KNOW PEOPLE AND PERHAPS OURSELVES OF EXPERIENCE THOSE KINDS OF CIRCUMSTANCES SO WE TALK ABOUT HAPPINESS WE WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO THINK ABOUT RESOURCES AND WE ALSO NED TO THINK ABOUT PERFORMANCE I THINK WE WOULD BE COMPLETE INACCURATE IF WE SIMPLY SAID OH YOU KNOW ANY WORK LEADING TO ANY OUTCOMES YOU KNOW ANY EFFORT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT IT GET TO YOU AN A IN SCHOOL AR AN EFFIN SCHOOL ISN'T AN IMPACT YOUR HAPPINESS I DON'T THINK ANY ONE WOULD AGREE WITH THAT AND YET IF YOU LOOKC AT THE MAJOR TAKE AWAYS AT LEAST AS THEY ARE COMMUNICATED TYPICALLY IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE AROUND THE LONGITUDINAL AND SHORT TERM STUDIES OF HAPPINESS THA TAKE AWAY GENERALLY IS MORE FOCUSSED ON SOCIAL CONNECTION AND HOW MONEY IS NOT IMPORTANT AND DON'T THINK ANYONE THAT SAYING THAT ACTUALLY MEANS THAT INCOME THAT CAN COVER YOUR EXPENSES PLUS SOME BUFFER ISN'T IMPORTANT BUT IT'S OFTEN NOT STATED SO IF WE WERE TO COME UP WITH A GENERAL MODEL OF HAPPINES THAT INCLUDES VARIOUS TOOLS FOR HOW TO INCREASE OUR LEVELS OF APPINESS I THINK IT'S ONLY FAIR TO INCLUDE BOTH NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC FORMS OF HAPPINESS AND TO PURSUE BOTH NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC HAPPINESS JUST REMIND YOU NATURAL HAPPINESS IS THE KIND OF HAPPINESS THAT WE ASSOCIATE WITH OBTAINING SOMETHING EITHER BY EFFORT OR BECAUSE IT WAS GIVEN TO US ALTHOUGH I DEFTLY WANT A HIGHLIKE THE FHAPCT THAT RECEIVING THINGS THAT DON'T REQUIRE MUCH REWARD IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THEM OVER TIME CAN BE DETRIMENTAL TO OUR DOPOMING SYSTEM THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ASIDE THE OTHER FORM OF HAPPINESS IS THE FORM OF HAPPINESS THAT WE CALL SYNTHETIC HAPPINESS WHICH IS FOR INSTANCE FOCUSSING ON SOCIAL CONNECTION AND WE TALKED ABOUT WAYS TO DO THAT AS A MEANS TO ENHANCE YOUR HAPPINESS RIGHT AGAIN THE THE LANGUAGE THATHE NAME  SYNTHETIC HAPPINESS IMPLIS SOMETHING KIND OF ARTIFICIAL BUT FRANKLY GENUINE SOCIAL CONNECTION IS GENUINE THERE'S NOTHING ARTIFICIAL ABOUT IT OR SYNTHETIC ABOUT IT IS THAT YOU CAN SYNTHESIZE IT THROUGH ACTION THROUGH DELIBERATE ACTION LIKEWISE BEING FOCUSSED OR ENCOURAGING YOURSELF WORKING ON BEING FOCUSED ON WHATEVER ACTIVITIES YOU APPIN TO BE ENGAGE IN POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE IS KNOWN TO INCREASE YOU'RE LEVELS OF HAPPINES AGAIN THIS IS A FORM OF SYNTHETIC HAPPINESS YOU'RE NOT OBTAINING ANYTHING NEW OR ADDITIONAL AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS IT'S ENTIRELY INTERNAL I THERE'S NO EXTERNAL REWARD THERE ISN'T MORE MONEY THAT ARRIVES WITH THIS OR A BETTER GRATE ALTHOUGH I WOULD MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT IF YOU ARE PRESENT TO THE WORK YOU'RE DOING IN ANY CONTACT PHYSICAL OR MENTAL WORK IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT YOU ARE GOING TO PERFORM BETTER AT THAT WORK SO WE HAVE NATURAL HAPPINESS IN SYNTHETIC HAPPINESS IN BOTH OF THEM REQUIRE OUR ATTENTION AND EFFORT AND IN FACT IF WE WERE TO DRAW LINK BETWEEN NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC HAPPINESS IT REALLY IS THIS CONCEPT OF PRESENTS OF REALLY BEING FOCUST ON WHAT WEARE DOING THETS MOST LIKELY TO LEAD TO THE OUTCOME STHAT WE WANT BOTH EXTERNALLY IN TERMS OF RECEIVING MONITARY REWARDS AR GRADES OR PRADE OR WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU HAPPEN TO BE PURSUING OUT THERE RESOURCES OF SOME KIND AND PRESENTS AND STRIVING TO BE PRESENT WHEN IN THE PURSUIT OF SO CALLED SYNTHETIC HAPPINESS IN THE FORM OF SOCIAL CONNECTION OR IN THE FORM OF REALLY FOCUSSING ON THE CHOICE THAT YOU'VE MADE AN MAKING THE BEST OF THAT CHOICE SPECIALLY SINCE YOU MADE THAT CHOICE IN A WAY THAT YOU DEEMED BEST AT THE TIME WELL THAT ALSO IS KNOWN TO INCREASE YOU'RE OVER ALL LEVELS OF HAPPINESS SO IF AN ABILITY TO FOCUS AND ATTEND TO THINGS DEEPLY IS REALLY WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT AND REALLY ACTS AS THE GREATEST LEAVER FOR BOTH NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC HAPPINESS WELL THEN TOOLS LIKE A FIVE MINUTE DAILY MEDITATION ARE A THIRTEEN MINUTE DAY MEDITATION AS WELL AS TOOLS THAT ALLOW US TO GET EXCELLENT SLEEP EVERY NIGHT WHICH OF COURSE SETS THE BASIS FOR ATTENTION DURING THE DAY IF YOU'VE EVER HAD A POOR NIGHT SLEEP THEN ARE VERY FAMILIAR HOW HARD IT IS TO FOCUS THE FOLLOWING DAY LEAST FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME BUT BUILDING OUR CAPACITY TO FOCUS THROUGH A FOCUSING EXERCISE WHICH AGAIN IS OFTEN CALLED MEDITATION BUT IS REALLY SIMPLY JUST A FOCUSING AND PERCEPTURAL EXERCISE THAT'S GOING TO CREATE AN OUT SIZE EFFECT ON ALL THE ASPECTS ALL THE BEHAVIORS THAT WE KNOW FEED IN TO CREATING NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC HAPPINESS AND SO IT'S REALLY FAIR TO SAY THAT ARE ABILITY TO ATTEND AND FOCUS REALLY EQUATES TO HAPPINESS SO AS IS OFTEN TYPICAL THIS PODCAST TO

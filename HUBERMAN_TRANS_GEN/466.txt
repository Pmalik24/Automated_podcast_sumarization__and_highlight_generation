WELCOME TO THE HUBERMANLAO SCIENCESCIENCE PACETO IM ANDREW HUBERMEN AND ON PROFESSOR OF NEROBILOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY MY GUEST IS EDO PORTAL EDO PORTAL IS SOMEBODY WHO TRULY DEFIES FORMAL DEFINITION HE IS HOWEVER CREDITED BY MANY TO BE THE WORLD EXPERT IN ALL THINGS MOVEMENT MOVEMENT IS ONE OF THE MORE FASCINATING AND IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IN FACT IT WAS THE GREAT NOBO PRIZE WINTER SHERRINGTON THAT SAID MOVEMENT IS THE FINAL COMMON PATH AND WHAT HE WAS REFERRING TO IS THE FACT THAT SO MUCH OF OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IS DEDICATED TO MOVEMENT AND IN PARTICULAR THAT THE HUMAN NERVOUS SYSTEM CAN GENERATE THE GREATEST VARIETY OF FORMS OF MOVEMENT WE CAN RUN WE CAN JUMP WE CAN CRAWL WE CAN MOVE AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS FAR MORE VARIATION IN MOVEMENT AND DIFFERENT TYPES AND SPEEDS OF MOVEMENT THAN ANY OTHER ANIMAL IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM CAN PERFORM MY INTEREST IN BRINGING ETOPORTAL ON TO THIS PODCAST STEMMED FROM A DISCUSSION ABOUT JUST THAT ABOUT SHERRINGTON AND THE ENORMOUS RANGE OF MOVEMENTS THAT HUMANS CAN ENGAGEIN EDO IS BOTH A PRACTISIONER AND AN INTELLECTUAL WE ALL KOW WHAT A PRACTITIONER IS AT SOMEBODY WHO WALKS THE WALK WHO ACTUALLY PERFORMS THE THING THAT THEY ARE KNOWLEDGABLE ABOUT AND INDEED EDO HAS STUDIED CAPOUERA A NUMBER OF OTHER MARTIAL ARTS DANCE GYMNASTICS VARIOUS FORMS OF SPORT HE'S TRAINED TOP ATHLETES LIKE CONIMER GREGGOR AND HE HAS MANY MANY OTHER CREDITS TO HIS NAME AS A PRACTITIONER AND TEACHER HOWEVER HE IS ALSO A TRUE INTELLECTUAL OF MOVEMENT I DEFINE AN INTELLECTUAL AS SOMEBODY WHO CAN BOTH THINK ABOUT AND TALK ABOUT A SUBJECT AT MULTIPLE LEVELS OF GRANULARITY THAT IS WITH EXQUISITE DETAIL END WITH ITS QUISITE SIMPLICITY DEPENDING ON THEIR AUDIENCE AND DEPENDING ON THE TOPIC AT HAND AND AS YOU'LL SOON HER FROM Y DISCUSSION WITH EDO HE IS BOTH A PRACTITIONER AND A TRUE INTELLECTUAL OF ALL THINGS MOVEMENT TO DAY THROUGH OUR DISCUSSION YOU WILL LEARN HOW THE NERVOUS SYSTEM GENERATES MOVEMENT AND THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF MOEMENT THE DIFFERENT SPEEDS OF MOVEMENT YOU ARE ALSO GOING TO GET AN INCREDIBLE INSIGHT THROUGH EDO'S MIND AND EYES OF HOW MOVEMENT CAN SERVE US IN THE VARIOUS CONTECTS OF LIFE NOT JUST IN SPORT NOT JUST IN EXORSCIZE BUT IN EVERY ASPECT OF OUR LIVES FROM THE TIME WE GET UP IN THE MORNING UNTIL THE TIME WE GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT HOW WE ENGAGE WITH OTHERS HOW WE ENGAGE WITH OURSELVES INDEED HOW MOVEMENT EVEN IN FORMS RELATIONSHIPS OF DIFFERENT KINDS I FOUND OUR DISCUSSION TO BE ONE OF THE MOST ENLIGHTENING AND INTERESTING DISCUSSIONS THAT IAVE EVER HAD NOT JUST ABOUT MOVEMENT BUT ABOUT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT BY THE END OF THIS EPISODE YOU WILL NOT ONLY LEARN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT ABOUT MOVEMENT THROUGH THE EYES AN MIND OF THE ONE AND ONLY EDO PORTAL BUT YOUR ALSO WILL LEARN A TREMENDOUST AMOUNT OF NERO SCIENCE ABOUT HOW THE CELLS AND CIRCUITS AND HORMONES AND NAURROW TRANSMITTERS OF YOUR BODY ASSIST IN C REATING THE VARIOUS FORMS OF MOVEMEN THA YOU CAN GENERATE THAT YOUR TRYING TO LEARN AND GENERATE AND THAT PERHAPS YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT TRYING TO LEARN AND GENERATE AND INDEED YOU'LL LEARN SOME PROTOCALS AN TOOLS FOR HOW TO DO THAT IN SCIENCE WE HAVE A PHRASE ACTUALLY ITS A TITLE THAT'S RESERVED FOR ONLY THE RAREST OF INDIVIDUALS WE SAY THAT SOMEBODY IS AN END OF ONE MEANING A SAMPLE SIZE OF ONE AND AS YOU'LL SOON LEARN ETO PORTAL IS TRULY AND AND OF ONE BEFORE WEU BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROR MY TEACHING AN RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING

SLASH HUBERMENNT AND NOW FOR MY DISCUSSION WITH EATO PORTALL EDO THANK YOU FOR COMING HERE TODAY I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR ITO SITTING DOWN WITH YOU TO TALK FOR A VERY LONG TIME I WAS FIRST EXPOSED TO YOUR WORK MY POST OR A PODCAST I BELIEVE OF YOHAT A GROUP OF PEOPLE WALKING DOWN HANDRAILS LITERALLY THE HANRILS ALONG STAIRWELLS AND AS A AN ONCE A FORMER ESCAPE WORDER ONCE ESCAPE ORDER ALWAYS ESCAPE ORDER WAS ESCAPE ORDER A HANRAILS HAVE A PARTICULAR MEANING BUT I WAS REALLY STRUCK BY FIRST OF ALL A THE INCREDIBLE RANGE OF SKILL THAT PEOPLE HAD AND YET THEY'RE WILLINGNESS TO DO THIS IGHT I THINK OF HNRILS ARE WALKING ON HANRAILS OR ESCAPE WATD IN HANRALS AS F POTENTIAL HAZARD AND YET SOME OF THE INCREDIBLE PROFICIENCY THAT SOME OF THE PEOPLE THERE INCLUDING YOURSELF HAD SO LIKE MANY PEOPLE I WAS DRAWN TO YOUR PRACTICING YOUR WORK INITIALLY THROUGH A A WIDE EYED WOW THE OTHER DOING SOME INCREDIBLE STUFF ON NATURAL OBJECTS MUCH ESCAPE WORDERS OR PARQUORER FOAKS DO BUT OVER THE YEARS WE'VE BEEN IN COMMUNICATION AND I'VE COME TO REALIZE THAT YOUR A TRUE INTELLECTUAL OF THE TOPIC OF MOVEMENT AND I DEFINE AN INTELLECTUAL AS SOMEBODY WHO CAN UNDERSTAND A TOPIC AND MULTIPLE LEVELS OF GRANULARITY DETAIL GENERAL SPECIFIC CONNECTIONS ET CETERA SO TO START OFF COULD YOU SHARE WITH US YOUR CONCEPTION OF THIS IDEA OF MOVEMENT YOU OBVIOUSLY MOVEMENT INVOLVES TRANSLATION THROUGH SPACE BUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT A MOVEMENT PRACTICE WHAT ARE YOU REALLY THINKING ABOUT WHAT WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A MOVEMENT PRACTICE I SBE QUESTION H I I SOMEHOW LEFT THE THE THE PHOENICIAN THE VERY TIED TE PHOENICIAN OF IT OUT FOR MYSELF BECAUSE I FELT IT WAS STARTINGTO CONSTRICT ME AND BE AROUND ME AND I LET THE PRACTICE ITSELF FREELY DEFINE IT M BUT I THINK EMPART OF OUR SENSE OF EVERYTHING IS EXTUALLY A SENSE OF MOVEMENT AND THAN THE STILLNESS INTE BEKRONDO DET SO FOR ME THIS IS THE ENTITY THE I REFER TO AS MOVEMENT AND USING THAT PERSPECTIVE FOURSE ELF EVOLUTIAN DEVELOPMENT OF COURSE THE PHYSICAL SIDE BUT ALSO MOVEMENT OF EMOTIONS MOVEMENT OF THOUGHTS AM AND ANY OTHER MOVEMENT STREAMS AND BY SWEECHING THESE LAYERS AND EXAMINING IT FROM DIFFERENT PLACES YOU GET A BETTER AND BETTER SENSE OF IT I THINK THE VISUALS NOW THEYS AND MEDIA ARE WHAT DEFINES FOR PEOPLE IN THE BEGINNING THINKS AND THEN LITTLE BY LITTLE WHOSE EXPERIENCE THEY CAN DIVE DEEPER WHICH IS GOOD THERE IS SOME OSPECTS SEXY OSPECTS E OR NOTSO SEXY ASPECTS AND THEN YOU PULONIT AND YOU STARTO EXAMINE AND DIVE DEEPER IN THEN YOU RECEIVE THE GIFT O FET FINDING OUTAMORE I HEARD YOU SAY ONCE THAT WE ARE NOT JUST A BRAIN WITH A BODY BUT WE ARE A BODY WITH A BRAIN WHICH I ABSOLUTELY LOVE BECAUSE AS A STUDENT AND A RESEARCHER OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM I NEVER THINK ABOUT THE BRAIN AS ITS OWN ISOLATED THING I THINK BUT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IN THE FACT THAT THE BRAIN AND THE SPINAL QUARTER CONNECTED TO THE BODY IN THE BODY IS CONNECTED IS UT TO THE BRAIN IN EVERY DIRECTION ITS EVERYTHING TRULY IS CONNECTED AT THE PHYSICAL LEVEL PHYSIOLOGICAL LEVEL CU YOU JUST SHARE FORA MOMENT HOW YOU THINK ABOUT THIS BODY BRAIN RELATIONSHIP IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW YOU MENTIONED MOVEMENT OF E MOTIONS MOVEMENT OF THE BODY THAT YOU CAN'T REALLY SEPARATE THE TWO AND FOR THE TYBIGO PERSON WHO'S LISTENING THIS THEY MIGHT NOT IMMEDIATELY UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT THAT MEANS MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE EXPERIENCE BUT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE BODY AN THE BRAIN AND THE THE WHOLE THING WORKING AS ONE COHESIVE WHOLE WHAT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU IT WERE PUT SIMPLY WHEN YOU DO A MOVEMENT PRACTISE WHAT ARE YOU FOCUSSING ON ARE YOU FOCUSSING ON THE MOVEMENT OF YOUR LIMBS I HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT'S TRUE BUT ARE YOU ALSO FOCUSSING OT HOW THAT MAKES YOU FEEL OR HOW YOUR FEELINGS MAKE YOU MOVE EM O CASE OF SOME THOUGHTS AM I WILL TRY NOT TO ENSWER ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS DURING THESE INTEREL BUT IILL DEFINITELY GIVE GIVE SOME THOUGHTS AND THEN WE CAN PLAY WITH IT M I THINK THESE THE PHOENICIANS AND IN GENERAL THE LIMITATION OF WORDS ANDS UP E CREATING SOME KIND OF IT CCORRUPTIVE PROCESS A WORDS CORRUPT US AND CORRUPT ARE UNDERSTANDING SO I THINK THE BRAIN BODY THESE CARTASIAN THE STATE OF MIND AND THINKING EBROUGHT A LOT OF GOOD BUT ALSO BROUGHT A LOT OF PROBLEMS AND MOVEMENT FOR ME IS THE ENTITY THAT TIES EVERYTHING TOGETHER ITS THE MAGIC IS THE FOULSANI MINDS IT'S WHEN THE COIN SPENS AND YOU SEE BOTH SIDES APPEAR AT THE SAME TIME IS AN BEAUTIFUL ANOLOGY FOR MA A FRIEND OF MIND AN OCTORASMOSOM AM SO THE MIND AND BODY ARE ONE OF THOSE PAIRS AND I CALL IT THE MOVEMENT BODY MIND SYSTEM ITS WHEN IT'S INTEGRATED EATS IN MOTION THERE IS ALSO EXTILLNESS THAT APPEARS THERE OF COURSE EWITHOUT IT THERE CAN BE NO MOTION BUT EM MA AYBE THAT IS A VERY GOOD WAY TO START TO THINK OF THINGS THERE IS NO REALLY PURE MENTAL PROCESSESS COGNITIVE PROCESSESS THERE IS NO PUR PHYSICAL PROCESSESS EVERYTHING TOUCHES EVERYTHING THERE IS A WHOLENESS AND THAT OLENESS IS IN MOTION AM YET THE MOVEMENT PRACTICE TAKES THES BEATS AND EXAMINE THEM AN HERE IS A PROGMATIC  THING THE THE SCIENTIST THE SEREBRAL THINKING ABOUT MOVEMENT THIS IS IMPORTANT THE AMOTIONAL SIDE COLORING FEELING THE COLORS AND THE TEXTURES OF MOTION A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE INVOLVED WITH A MOVEMENT PRACTICSE NEVER AND UP FEELING MOTIONS REALLY FOCESSING ON HOW IT MAKES YOU FEEL OR HOW IT FEELS ITSELF AND THEN THE ACTUAL MOVEMENT THE ACTION ACTION AND MOTION AND THOUGHT AND THOSE ARE THREE STREAMS OF MOVEMENT AND THE INTERLACS TOGETHER INTO THIS  KIND OF A BRAIDED EXPERIENCE AND WHOLE EXPERIENCE AND I TRY TO BRING ALL THESE ASPECTS INTO MY MY PRACTICE IN THE WAY THAT I LEAVE MY LIFE THINK MOST PEOPLE WE EMBARK ON A MOVEMENT PRACTICE WILL FIRST WANT TO KNOW WHICH MOVEMENTS TO DO RIGHT SQUATS PLANKS A PUSH UPS ON PUROETS RIGT A PICTURE MOVEMENT ITIT COUND BE ANY MOEMENT ARE THERE ANY SORT OF JUST BASIC ENTRY POINTS THAT YOU BELIEVE EVERYBODY SHOULD WALK THROUGH AS THEY EMBRACE A MOE IN PRACTICE THE FIRST TIME AND MAY LEVEN EVERY TIME THEY DOU MOVE IN PRACTICE IN EARLIER TO DAY A THE GREAT A PRIVILEGE OF BEING GUADED THROUGH A LONG SERIES OF MOVING PRACTICES AND YET THE FIRST PRACTICE WE DID INVOLVED AT FIRST ANY WAY STILLNESS NOT MOVEMENT SO IF IF YOU WERE COULD YOU INFORM US OU HOW PEOPLE SHOULD THINK ABOUT APPROACHING A MOVEMENT PRACTICE WHAT IS THE FIRST LAYER OF ANY GOOD MOVEMENT PRACTISE SO YOU TOUCH THE WORD MOVEMENTS AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO FOR ME TO SEPARATE IT FROM THE WORLD MOVEMENT WITH A CAPITAL AM MOVEMENTS ARE THE CONTAINERS AND MOVEMENT IS THE CONTENT AND THE CONTENT CANNOT BE CARRIED IN ANY WAY WITHOUT CONTAINERS SO THE FIRST ENTRY POINT IS TO CHOOSE CONTAINERS AND THEN THE SECOND THING TO MAKE SURIST TO PUT SPECIFIC CONTENT INTO THOSE CONTAINERS AND THEN ENJOY THEM I TELL PEOPLE THAT IT'S LIKE A CUP OF WATER AND YOUR BEING HANDED THAT CUP OF WATER ING NOW THEY'S VERY OFTEN PEOPLE WILL START TO CHEW ON THE CUP INSTEAD OF DRINKING THE WATER MAKING IT YOURS DISCART THE CUP AND THEN MAY BE LATER YOU WANT TO HAVE BONE BROTH OR SUP SO USE A DIFFERENT CONTAINER A BOWL SO A MOVEMENT PRACTICE TO START CAN START FROM ANYWHERE IT'S ARISE ON IT'S IT'S AN OPEN SYSTEM IT HAS NO CENTR ITS THESCENTRALIZE AND IT CAN BE APPROACHFOM ANYWHERE AND THE THAT'S ITS MAGIC AND THAT'S THAT'S THE BENEFIT OF IT SOMEPEOPLE E FIND THE BODY A GOOD ENTRY POINT SOME PEOPLE DON'T EVEN ENTER FROM THE BODY AM SOMETIMES YOU CAN ENTER FROM OTHER PERSPECTIVES AND THEN INSIDE THE BODY FOR EXAMPLE WHERE SHOULD WE ENTER IF WE DECIDED TO TAKE THE BODY APPROACH THE SPINE CAN BE A NICE DECISION BUT SOME WILL CHOOSE JUST THE PELEVICE ANY ONE OF THOSE POINTS ARE VALIED AND THEN PLAYFULNESS CAN BE AN ENTRY POINT AND ATTRIBUTE OR AND THIS IS SO OPEN SO I I DON'T WANT TO LIMIT E PEOPLE AND LIMIT THEIR MINDS IN THE WAY THAT THE ENGAGE WITH A PRACTICE BUT I ALSO WANT TO IN COURAGE THE SELF INQUIRY AM I DOING MOVEMENTS PRACTICE WHER  I DOING A MOVEMENT PRACTICE SO CAN YOU HELP ME DISTINGUISH THE TU A LITTE FURTHER I THINK I UNDERSTAND THE IFFERENCE BETWEEN A H CORT OF THE NOWN VERSES THE VERBS AND IN SOME WAYS I HERE WE ARE DEALING WITH THE CHALLENGE OF YOU KNOW THAT THE BARRIERS THAT LANGUAGE PRESENT TO SOMETHING THAT'S PHYSICAL RIGHT I MEIN INDEED THERE MAY NOT BE A AF TO ASSUME THERE IS NO PERFECT VERBAL LANGUAGE FOR MOVEMENT THERE ARE CERTAIN MOVEMENTS THAT THE FI LANGUAGE I COULD SAY SOMEBODY JUMPED AT A PARTICULAR TRAJECTORY AT A PARTICULAR SPEED AND MOVE THIS LIMB IN THAT LEM BUT BY FRACTIONATING IT SOMETHING IS MOST DEFINITELY LOST AN SO IF SOMEONE WANTED TO BHAT'S I GET IN BETTER TOUCH WITH THEIR BODY IN CUOTS IN ORDER TO EXPLORE THE INFINITE SPACE THAT HIS MOVEMENT HOW MIGHT THEY BEGIN TO APPROACH THAT IS IT DOES IT BEGIN WITH AN AWARENESS WITH PRACTICE OR BOTH IT BEGINS WITH EDUCATION THAT'S PROBABLY THE MOST STABLE POINT OF ENTRY AND AWARENESS TO SOME SOMETHING AS A CONCEPT THAT IT IS A CONCEPT THAT THERE IS A VALIDITY OR BECAUSE SOMETIMES PEOPLE LOOK FOR THAT AND TO LOOKING AT THIS ENTITY TIS OPEN ENTITY AND THAT THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY ANSWERING QUESTIONS IS IM NOT SOMETHING I CAN DO OR EVEN ATTEMPT TO DO I BELIEVE IN THE POWER OF THE NONCOMPLETE PROCESS LIKE MAKING THIS AME THIS A TABLE BUT LEAVING SOMETHING UNDONE NOT PERFECTING THE PRODUCT WHY BECAUSE IT OFFERS SOME KIND OF A DYNEMIC NATURE OF EVOLUTION THAT NATURALLY UNREVELS FROM IT ALMOST LIKE SOMETIMES I DO IT I COUNT REPS AND I'LL ONLY COME TO NINE BECAUSE ITTENDS TO LEAVE PEOPLE IN THE COUNT AND IT KEEPS GOING INSTEAD OF GIVING THEM THE TEN EVERYONE WANTS TAND ONTEN YET WHICH IS BECAUSE OF THE DESSIMAL SISTEMCS IT SO ALL KINDS OF THE THINGS LIKE THAT IS ALSO IMPORTANT WITH THE MOVEMENT IDEA IS TO DISCUSS TO EXAMINED TO LOOK TO TASTE TO TRY BUT THEN ALSO NOT TO TRY TO CAPTURE BECAUSE IF YOU LIKE THE INVISIBLE LOUP OF HOFSTATE IF YOU LOOK AT IT TOO CLOSELY IS GONE BUT IF YOU LOOK AWAY IT FUNCTIONS AND EXIST JUST LIKE US VERY POWERFULLY AND OBVIOUSLY GIVES US THE EXPERIENCES THAT WE HAVE SO WHEN PEOPLE ENTER MOVEMENT PRACTICE IT IS ABOUT EDUCATION BRINGING SOME AWERENESS TO DE FECT THAT THEY ARE LEAVING IN A BODY THAT THEY ARE LEAVING IN MOTION THAT THEIR MIND IS A TYPE OF MOVEMENT THAT THEIR LIFE IS A TYPE OF MOVEMENT BRINGING ATTENTION TO THE MOVEMENT OF THE EMOTIONS AS WELL BRINGING JUST ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THINGS ARE IN MOTION THE THTHEYOU RECLY TO SAY PANTARE ALL IN FLUK NOTHING STOPS BESIDES SOMETHING THAT E'S THE BACKGROUND OF IT AND AND ALLOWS IT TO EXPRESS AND THIS IS THE BEAUTY OF THINGS AND THIS FOR ME IS THE MOVEMENT PRACTICE IS IS THIS EXAMINATION AND BRINGING THISE AWERENESSING TO THINGS AS WE SIT NOW HERE I'M ALSO AWARE OF MY BODY M I'M ALSO AWARE OF THE WAY THAT THINGS MAKE ME FEEL THE WAY THAT YOUR FACE IS COMMUNICATING TO ME AND AND I'M NOT JUST IN SOME LIMITED M AND AND VERY VERBAL OVERLY VERBAL STATE BECAUSE IT MEES US A LOT OF THE BEAUTIFUL FLUKS I'M GOING TO INJECT SOME A'M PORPROJECTS SOME IDEAS AND IM PERHAPS YOU WOULD TELL ME IF THERE RIDICULOUS I'M POTENTIALLY USEFUL OR USEFUL I'M AS I UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW AND WEVE DISCUSSED EARLIER IS THAT MOVEMENT CANAN SHOULD BE INCORPORATED INTO ONE'S ENTIRE LIFE EVEN HEARD YOU SAY THAT EVEN BEFORE GETTING OUT OF BED IN THE MORNING ONE CAN EXPERIENCE MOVEMENT AND IT DOESN'T USS ERLY HAVE TO BE OF TH INTIMATE KIND WITH SOMEBODY ELSE ITS IT CAN BE PAYING ATTENTION TO THE RHYTHM OF ONE'S BREATH OR HOW YOU GET OUT OF THE BED OR I'M ACTUALLY AN ANTICIPATION OF YOU ARRIVING HERE TO DAY I NOTICE THAT AS I WAS GOING UP AND DOWN THE STAIRS IN THIS AND THIS HOUSE I'M THAT I WAS INJECTING A LITLE BIT OF PLAYFULNESS IN THE WAY THAT I MIGHT HAVE MANY MANY DECADES AGO BY HAVEN'T FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND I ASKED MYSELF WHETHER NOT THAT'S WHAT E DO IS REFERRING TO WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT THREADINGHISS SBODY AWARENESS THROUGHOUT THE DAY AS OPPOSE TO BUT OF COURSE NOT EXCLUSIVE FROM JUST SAYING I HAVE FORTY FIVE MINUTES I'M GOING TO DO MOVEMENT PRACTICE BEFORE I SHOWER AND HAVE SOME DINNER RIGT IHAVE TO IMAGINE BOTH ARE HELPFUL BUT IN TERMS OF MOVING THROUGH THE DAY AND HAVING BODILY AWARENESS CLEARLY THERE AN INFINITE NUMBER OF WAYS ONE COULD DO THAT THE GE E SHARE OF YOU YOU MENTION AM WE WONT A PAY TETION OTHEIR BREATH TO PAY TNTION THE POSTURE AND THE SNOTION OF PLAY IS A VERY ATTRACTIVEOR AS WE SAY IN SI ITS ITS A STICKY CONCEPT A CONCEPT THAT CAN IVE DRAW US ONE IN MA IF YOU WERE OT TO YOU SURE IT US JUST SOME IDEAS YOU GET PEOPLE THINKING ABOUT A MAY BEVEN A INCORPORATING WOVING PRACTICE INTO THEIR DAY AND MAYBEVEN A TOUCH ON THE THE POTENTIA ROLL OF PLAY OR PLAYFULNESS UQ AM YET THOSE THOSE ARE SOME GOOD DIRECTIONS I THINK ONE THING IS THIS WHAT YOU CALL WORDLESSNESS I IHVE BEEN RECOMMENDING TO PEOPLE NON VERBAL EXPERIENCES AND THE AWARENESS OF THE BODY WHICH IS NOT REALLY THE WORNESS OF THE BODY AS YOU KNOW NOT PURELY OR NOT FULLY THE WARENESS OF MOTION IS VERY I GOOD WAY TO START  TO BRING A WORENESS TO THAT LAYER AND THE CLAYR WILL START TO GET CLARIFIED MORE AND MORE AND MORE THE MORE YOU PRACTISE AND THEN IT WILL ENABLE FOR MOST PEOPLE A SAFE HEAVEN AWAY FROM MANY STATES AND DIFFICULTIES AND WILL UNLOCK A LOT OF POTENTIAL ATTRIBUTES AND STRENGTHAND FRESHNESS AND A LOT OF BEAUTIFUL THINGS REALLY ONE OF THE PRETTY PERSPECTIVES ABOUT WHO WE ARE COMES E FROM PERSON WHO INFLUENCED MY THINKING ALATMONCHEFELDEN CRIES THE LATE MONCHEFELTON CRIES AND HE TALKS ABOUT THE BODY AS THE CORE THREE ELEMENTS THE COR NERVOUS SYSTEM TOO IS THE MECHANICAL SYSTEM OF MUSCLE SKELETON ET CETERA AND THE THIRD IS THE ENVIRONMENT WHICH IS A UNIQUE WAY TO LOOK AT IT AND IT TALKS ABOUT HOW THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IS BOTH GET RECEIVING INFORMATION FROM THE OUTSIDE N FRUM THE INSIDHE AND IN THE FIRST YEARS OF LIFE YOU WORK A LOT ON THE FRENTIATING THOUTH WHAT AWHAT IS ME AND WHAT IS NOT ME AND I THINK MOVEMENT WHEN YOU FEEL MOVEMENT YOU FEEL THE MOVEMENT OF THE OUTSIDE THAT IS OF COURSE ARRIVING TO YOU AND RECEIVING THIS AND ALSO YOUR OWN INTERNAL MOVEMENT AND THE SAME CAN BE SAID FOR STILLNESS SO BRINGING THE ATTENTION INTO THOSE LAYERS IT'S A TREAKY THING IT'S ONE OF THOSE ELUSIVE THINGS TO LOOK AT BUT IT'S DEFINITELY OF HUGE BENEFIT TO START TO TRAIN IT START TO PRACTISE IT TO FEEL NOT OUR THOUGHTS NOT NECESSARILY OUR BODY BUT TO START TO RECOGNIZE THE DEYNAMIC NATURE THE FLUX THE MOTION AND IT OCCURS IN ALL THES LAYERS SO YOU CAN YOU CAN YOU WILL NEED TO FIND IT IN MOTAPLE OCCATIONS BEFORE YOU START TO MORE AND MORE M MAKE IT YOUR OWN MAKE IT REALLY YOURS AND HOW FOR EXAMPL AND SIMPLE PROGMATIC THINGS I USED TO DO THIS I SPEND SOME TIME IN HOME CONGUE  WOULD  NEED TO GET MY PRACTICIN BUT I AM REALLY TURNED OFF FROM COMMERCIAL GIMS AND THERE IS NOT A LOT OF NATURE ACCESSIBLE THERE SO WOULD JUST STRAP ON MY BAG AND I WOULD WALK THE STREETS OF HONG CONG WHICH ARE VERY CROWDED AND I WOULD TRY TO AVOID TOUCHING ANYONE AND IT WOULD BE LIKE TWO HOURS OF OF JUST LIKE MOINVOLVED FULLY INVOLVED FULLY IN MY BODY AND EXPERIENCING BEAUTIFUL THINGS AND ENJOYN AND DEVELOPING MYSELF AS WELL IN ALL KINDS OF SENARIOS UP AND DOWN AND IN THE ESCALATORS AND OFF SO THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A A WAY TO TO PRACTICE AND THEN THE WAY THAT WE'RE SITTING LIKE THISCHAIRS FOR EXAMPLE OUR CHAIRS ARE NOT VERY DYNAMIC BUT THERE IS ROCKING CHAIRS RIGHT AND THIS IS SOMETHING I RECOMMEND FOR A LOT OF KEIDS AND LIKE IN SCHOOLS I USED TO ROCK ON THE CHAIR WHICH IS VERY COMMON I SURE ISCAPEORD UNDERNEATH MY CHAIR ROW BACK AND FORTH AN THE TEACHER WOULD TELL ME TO STAP AND SLOW LY A LITTLE BYTHOU TRY TNO GET THE MORT SOLOMNLY THAN I COULD WITHOUT IT YOU THEN TELL ME THEY REON TAKE IT AWAY WUL TRY WHICH IS PROBABLY HORRIBLE HORRIBLE ADVICE AND INSTRUCTION AND JUST LIKE SIT UP STRAIGHT AND CHOO WITH YOUR MOUTH CLOSED BECAUSE THEY REMOVE A LOT OF THE SELF EDUCATION AND A LOT OF THE SELF DEVELOPMENT AND THE PRACTICALMAN DISCOVERIES THAT ARE NECESSARY AND EVEN WILL DEM AGE FOCESS AND THINKING PROCESSES IN SIN SOME WAYS AM SO I OUT FOR EXAMPLE I WOULD MAKE THE CHAIRS EVEN MORMO BY AND THE I WOULD SUPPORT MORE MOTION AND THEN I WOULD BE ABLE TO BRING ATTENTION THER BUT I WOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO BRING ATTENTION AWAY FROM IT INTO OTHER THINGS AND IT KEEPS REFRESHING ME SO I DON'T BECOME STALE THE WATER DOESN'T STAND THIS IS THE BEAUTY OF O MOVEMENT SO YOU CAN FOCASS FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME AND DOING CREDIBLE THINGS WITH THE MIND WITH FOCASS WITHOU EARNEST ATTENTION AM AND ITS WIT SKIN IN THE GAME SO I'M NOT TALKING AS SOME MEDITATOR AND IS DESCRIBING THE ACT OF BEING VERY FOCESS BUT THEN I PUT A STICK ON THE EDGE OF HIS FINGERS AND I TELL IN BALANCE IT HE EVERY ONE CAN DO IT FOR TEN SECONDS AND I TELL A MOK I NOW HOLD A TEN MINUTES AND YOU SEE THAT THE SKILL HAS HE HAS NO SKIN IN THE GAME IT WASN'T DEVELOPED IN VARIES AND AREOUS BUT SO THERE IS A DELUSION THAT START TO DEVELOP AM AND AND THAT'S THAT'S HOW MOVEMENT KEEPS ME VERY HONEST AND HUMBLE IN THE WAY THAT I VIEW HUMILITY AND AND IN A WAY THAT PROTECTS ME AN AND AND KEEPS ME YER KEEPS ME FRESH II LOVE THE EXAMPLE OF MOVING THROUGH THE CROWDED TREE WITH E BACK PACK BECAUSE OF THE WAY IN WHICH ITS COMPLELY ADAPTED TO THE SITUATION YOU HAPPEN TO BE IN TEN HIGHLIGHTS THE FACT THAT ONE DOESN'T NEED A GEM OR UM ANY SPECIFIC CENAREO IM ALTHOUGH WE WILL AT CERTAINLY TOUCH ON IDEAL LEARNING CIRCUMSTANCES FOR MOVEMENT AND UM SOME OF A THE WORE THO YOU'RE DOING OF COURSE THE LESS OF YOUR OWN PERSONAL PRACTICE AND UNDERSTANDING AND KNOWLEDGE YOU'VE DONE THE MORE TOYS YUNIT THE MORE YOU'VE REALLY WORKED ON YOURSELF THE MORE HIGH TACK YOU ARE THE MORE LOW TECK ARE YOUR TOOLS THE MORE HIGHTIC YOU ARE AND THIS IS THE MOST ADVANCED ACKNOWLEDGY BY FAR ON THIS PLANET WIS ALL THE ADVANCEMENT ITS DOESN'T EVEN START TO SCRATCHING YOU KNOW IT FROM THE WAY THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE EYES ALL THE WAY TO WITH ALL TO RESPECT TO THE BOSTON ROBOTICS A FIVE YEAR OLD MOVE MOTION  MOVEMENTS A OR ANIMALAN MOTION WAS VERY UNDER DEVELOPED AS STILL RELATIVELY TO US AS SYSTEMS SO IMPORTANT TO TO REMIND OURSELVES A WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH THE BODY AND GRAVITY A LORE A PIECE OF FLOOR APIECE OF WALL A CORNER OF A ROOM IS THE BEAUTIFUL SENARY WHICH YOU CAN BECOME DISCOVER IN AND PLAY IN AND BUT WE ARE NOT SO DEVELOPED SO WE DON'T SEE THOSE OPTIONS AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I TRY TO STIMULATE AND THAT'S WHY I MADE AT A POINT TO AVOID ANY OF THE BIG SPONCERN SHEEP AND AND AND HIGH TAKE TOOLS AND I ONE POINT BROUGHT A STICK INTO YOU KNOW BIG CONVENTIONS AND AND OR I SOMETIMES I USE A SHIRT WITH HOLLS IN IT AN THAT JUST LIKE A USESHIRT AS A POINT TO MAKE WHEN I'M ADDRESSING A CROWD TO KEEP THINGS WERE WERE IT'S IMPORTANT AND IT'S IMPORTANT WE ARE IMPORTANT AND OUR EXPERIENCES IMPORTANT AND WE WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL THTHIS THIS E HABITS AND THIS DIRECTIONS THEY COME FROM SO MANY TIMES GOOD INTENTION BUT THEY ARE HETHE DEVIL MANY TIMES THEY TURNINTO THE DEVIL JUST LIKE OUR ACKNOWLEDGY IN OW DAYS AND WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH PEOPLE WITH DEPRESSIONND WITH MEANING MEANINGLESSNESS AN ALSO WITH THE BODY IN VARIOUS PERSPECTIVES OR EVEN I WILL ALSO FLIPP IT INTO HIGH PERFORMANCE SPORTS AND THAT THEIR PRIZE BECAUSE FOR ME THIS IS NOT HA MOVEMENT PRACTICE IT ERASES THE PERSON IN THE CENTR OF IT AND THEN CANE PLACES LIKE SKATE BOARDING ERE BREAK DNCING WERE SOMEBODY WITH THE DISABILITY BECOMES THE BEST IN THE WORLD TURNS IT INTO THE BIGGEST ADVANTAGE BUT YOU WOULD NEVER BE ACCEPTED INTO GYMNASTICS CLESS AND I LOVED TAT AND AND THAT THE CHANGE TO PLACE CHANGE IN THE CENTR IT IT'S IMPORTANT JUST SHON A MENTION OF A FEW SPORTS AM MAYBE WITH CHARLES POLOQUIN OR MAYBE AS ANOTHER TRAINER THAT IM I HEARD ONCE SAY THAT YOU KNOW FOR KIDS ONE OF THE WORST THINGS THEY CAN DO AS OVER SPECIALIZE IN A PARTICULAR SPORT AM THE IDEA BEING THAT IT LEADS TO IMPROVEMENTS IN PERFORMANCE IN A VERY NARROW DOMAIN BUT THEY RAISED THE IDEA ITHAT IT COULD PERHAPS ALSO CONSTRAINS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM SUCH THAT CERTAIN EMOTIONAL STATE SURGEN CERTAIN A INTELLECTUAL ABILITIES WILL FOR EVER BE SHUT OFF BECAUSE OF THE INTENSE PLASTICITY THAT OCCURS EARLY IN LIFE THE MORE I LEARNED FROM YOU THE MORE I'M THINKING THAT THAT STATEMENT REALLY SHOULD BE EXTENDED TO ALL OF LIFE AND I LOVED TO REMIND PEOPLE A BECAUSE I START OFF AS A DEVELOPMENT ON ER ABOUT US THAT DEVELOPMENT DOESN'T START AN END YOU DON'T HAVE CHILDHOOD AND ADOULTHOOD OUR LIFE IS ONE LONG DEVELOPMENT AL ARK FROM BIRTH UNTIL DEATH HOWEVER LONG THAT MIGHT BE SO IF ONE IS GOING TO BE ANTI SPECIALIST MAYBE EVEN WECALL THAT A GENERALIST WHAT OES THAT LOOK LIKE OTE OF THE DIFFERENT DOMAINS OF MOVEMENT PRACTICE AND AS I ASKED THIS I REALIZE I I IN SERIOUS DANGER OF FRACTIONATING MOVEMENT INTO A LIST OF WORDS LIKE STRENGTH AND SPEED AND EXPLOSIVENESS AND A SUPPLENESS A WORD THAT IHAVE HEARD YOU USED BEFORE AND YET I THINK FOR MOST PEOPLE BECAUSE WE THINKIN WORDS OFTEN AM SOME OF THOSE CATEGORIES CAN BE USEFUL SO LET' SAY I WAS GOINGTO EMBARK ON A MOVEMENT PRACTICE OR A CHILD WAS GOING TO EMBARK ON A MOVEMENT PRACTICE IT EITHER THROUGHOUT THE DAY OR FOR A DEDICATED PERIOD OF TIME WHAT ARE THE SORTS OF CATEGORIES OF MOVEMENT THAT I MIGHT WONT TO THINK ABOUT BOLISTIC MOVEMENT SMOOTH MOVEMENT MAYBE YOU COULD A JUST EN RICH US WITH SOME OF THE A SOME OF THE LANDSCAPE AROUND THA  FIRST THAADDRESS THE FIRST PART AND THAT YOU MENTIONED AND IT I'VE LEARNED FROM YOU ABOUT CERTAIN CHANGES IN THE WAY THAT THINGS DEVELOPE LATERING LIFE VERSAS EARLIER IN LIFE AND YOUE RITE IS O SOMETHING THAT CHOSPOLICUIN ALSO MENTION THAND I LEARNED FROM BECKING TE DAY AS WELL FROM HIM ND WHICH CAN SEEM DARK A BETEN AN AND KIND OF HOPELESS A BUT THEN YYOU YOU SHOULD GO BEYOND THAT AM ONE THING THAT DOES SEEM TO TO TO A PEER FOR ME WHEN I LOOK AROUND ITS THESE THE CONSEPTOF UNIQUE POSTURES AN AND I THINK THIS IS TRUE FOR POSTURES OF THOUGHT EMOTIONAL POSTURES AND MOVEMENT POSTURES TRULY EARLIER IN LIFE WE ARE CREATING THESE UNIQUE POSTURES AND THEY GET INTO THESE DRAWERS OR LIKE A LANGUAGE LETTERES LATER IN LIFE THE PROCESS MOVES MORE TOWARDS INTEGRATION OF THIS UNIQUE POSTURES INTO ALL DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS THE BEAUTY OF IT IS THAT YOU CAN USE VERY FEW POSTURES TO CREATE MANY POSSIBILITIES JUST LIKE A LIBENITS A SEARCH FOR A LANGUAGE THAT CONTAIN ONE SIMPLE ONLY VERSES TOO WHICH HE DISCOVERED AM AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS OFTEN SEEM LIKE IT TAKES SOME ONE WHO MOVES IN A CERTAIN WAY AND YOU TEACH HIM ALL THISE NEW SPORTS OR TECHNIQUES BUT ESSENTIALLY IF YOU LOOK DEEPLY AND YOUR SENSITIVE ESEETS THE SAME POSTURES THAT HE WILL HAVE TO WORK WITH TILL THE END OF HIS LIFE THE SAME THINKING POSTURES AND THIS THIS IS REALLY PROBLEMATIC WHERE WE ARE WE ARE NOT FREEING THE MIND BEYOND THIS SAY HOW WOULD I SAY A CAREFUL THING OF THINKING AND WE ARE ACTUALLY LETTING GO OF THE CONTENT WE WEWE GET MORE AND MORE FOCEST ON THE THE WAY THE THE WAY OF THINKING VERSES THE THINKING ITSELF OR OR HABITUAL WAYS AND FORMS OF THINKING ASSOCIATED THINKING ETCETERA AND EMOTIONALLY THE SAME WE ARE CONSTRUCTING THIS EMOTIONAL POSTURES AND THEN WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE REST OF OUR LIVES WORKING WIS THAT SO THIS IS THE DARK SIZE AND BUT OF COURSE THEY RE ALWAYS POSSIBILITIES AM BOTH I THINK INVADING THIS EARLY SYSTEM TO SOME EXTENT EVEN IF IT'S FIVE PER CENT OR SEVEN PER CENT TO WHATEVER PER CENT AND ALSO ON THE FREEING YOURSELF OF GOING BEYOND ALL POSTURES PERIOD WORKING WITH THE POSTURES YOU HAVE BUT TO WORDS THE POSTURE LESS WAY OF DOING THINGS SO THIS IS SOMETHING INTERESTING AND TO WORK WHEN WHEN PEOPLE WORK WITH MOVEMENTS BUT FINALLY ARE ABLE TO GO INTO MOVEMENT AND THIS MAGIC STARTS TO HAPPEN AND THEN THE TECHNIQUS FALL APART AND SOMETHING APPEARS AM AND AND IT'S  FACE CHANGE IT'S IT'S A TRANSFORMATION IT'S NOTET IT'S IT'S A BINARY MOMENT THERE IS A JUMP THERE FOR SURE AN IT'S VERY RARE TO SEE BOTH IN THINKING AND A MOTIONALLY AND AND OTHERWAYS WE HAVE MANY NAMES FOR ITTEN SOMETALK ABOUT ENLIGHTMENT AND SOME TALK ABOUT ALL KIND OF PROCESSESS RELATED TO IT AND I THINK MOST OF THEM AR SHADOWS OF THE SUN BUT IT'S NOT THE SUN ITSELF RE AND THEN TALKING ABOUT WAYS OF THINKING ABOUT MOVEMENT THIS IS WHERE I USE AN SOMETHING I I CALL MY SLICEAND DICES BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEM O USING WORDS AND THE PHOENICIANS AND CATEGORIES I TRY TO CREATE A LOT OF THEM AND I WRITE HEM ONE ON THE PAPER AND THEN I CRUMBLE THEM THROW THEM INTO THE BEEN AND I KEEP DOING IT ALL MY LIFE THE WRITING THEM DOWN AND THE DICKING ON IT IS VERY IMPORTANT ALSO VERY IMPORTANT TO LET IT GO I TELL PEOPLE WHAT YOU FOR GOT IS NOT THE SAME FOR FORGETTING IS NOT THE SAME AS NEVER KNOWING IT THE CRUMBLING AND THROWING AWAYS A FORM OF FORGETTING BUT IT LEAVE SOME KIND OF A HOMEO PATHIC I TRACE BEHIND SO LET'S TAKE SOME SLICE AND ICE AND TR TO LOOK AT IT HERE IS A PHYSICAL ONE CONTRACTION RELAXATION THAT'S A SPECT RUM AND PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING FALLS ON THIS PECTRUM ALSO IN TERMS OF ANALYZING A PERSON OR YOURSELF YOU CAN TELL ME IF YOU FEEL CLOSER TO THISSIDE OR CLOSER TO THAT SIDE AND THEN IT ALLOWS YOU TO EXAMINE YOUR PRACTICES HOW MANY OF THE PRACTICES ARE MOVING YOU TOWARDS BALANCE AND HOW MANY ARE IT'S YOUR EDICTION OF JUST DOING WHAT YOUR GOOD AT VERSES WHAT YOU NEED AND HERE IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE PHYSICAL CULTURE SO WE HAVE THE DENSE REA WORKING WITH INTERNAL CONCEPTS AND EXPRESSING THEM OBSTRUCT CONCEPTS EXPRESSION SECOND PERSPECTING THE MARSHIAL CONSEBUT NOT IN THE SENSE OF JUST FIGHTING BUT ALSO PARTNERING WORKING WITH ANOTHER PERSON A DYNAMIC ANTATY THAT IS COMMUNICATING WITH YOU THE THIRD ONE IS I CALL THE ELEMENTS WORKING WITH THE ENVIRONMENT THE NEXT ONE IS A SOMATIC ONE IS THE INTERNAL PRACTICE AND OF COURSE THEY ARE ALL GRAYS ZOWNS AND AND ANOTHER ONE IS OBJECT MONIPULATORY WHICH YOU CAN THINK OF IT ALSO AS THE ENVIRONMENT BUT IT'S MORE SMALL OBJECTS HEAVY OBJECTS MANY OBJECTS FEW OBJECTS AND THEN YOU CAN LOOK AT THESE WAY OF THINKING AND YOU CAN OHI HAVE MANY OF MY PRACTICES IN THIS DIRECTION BUT NOT  AND YOU CAN DRAW IT FOR YOURSELF SO THAT'S ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE AN THIS WAY I I USE DOZENS OF PERSPECTIVES AND WITH THE YEARS IT GIVES PEOPLE A SNSE OF WERE THEY ONE A GO HOW THEY WANT TO DO IT AND WHAT THEY NEED TO ADDRESS VERSES WHAT THEY LIKE TO ADRESS ITS IT IS IT HELPFUL VERY HELPFUL THOSE DIFFERENT BENS ARE VERY HELPFUL I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT YOU MENTION THAT PEOPLE WE OFTEN PRACTICE WHAT THEIR GOOD AD AS SUPPOSE TO WHAT THEY NEED IN NONE GIM CULTURE WI REFER TO THIS AS THE GATHAT ALWAYS GEPTS LIKE THEY PERSON RIT AN BIG UPPER BODIES IN LEGS OR AS YOU'LL SEE PEOPLE TO HAVE THIS ENORMOUS THE TOURSES AND THEIR BENCH PRESSING ALL DAY BUT THEY CLEARLY NEED TO PULL ON AN OBJEC EVERY ONES IN A WHILE TO CREATE SOME BALANCE BUT THEY DON'T DO IT BECAUSE THEY FOR WHATEVER REASON ATHEY HAVE AN OBSESSION WITH MOVING GREATER AND GREATER POUNDAGE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IM WHICH IN CERTAIN SPORTS LIKE POWER LIFTING WORST THAT ICS AREN'T THE THE GOAL AND IT'S SIMPLY TO PUSH MORE WEIGHT OFF ONES JUST THAT YOU COULD IMAGINE THAT THERE' SOMETHING BENEFICIAL THERE HOWEVER I THINK THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IN INTELLECTUAL ENDEAVOURS AND IN MOVEMENT ENDEAVOURS FI UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY TO BRING ONESELF TO A PLACE OF REAL CHALLENGE ON A REGULAR BASIS  FACT EARLIER TO DAY I WAS IN A STATE OF CONSTANT CHALLENGE CAUSE IT WAS ALL NEW TO ME AND AS MUCH AS I TOLD MYSELF BEGINNERS MINE BEGINNERS MINE BEGINNERS MINE IT IT'S HORRD I CONFESS DOD NOT WANT TO DO WELL TO PERFORM WELL RIGHT AND AND I THINK THNK THAT'S A NATURAL AND HEALTHY THING OW THE ONLY NATURAL IT IS NECESSARY BUT I WANT YOU TO KEEP IT ON THAT SIDE AND TO BRING SOMETHING TO BALANCE IT IF THERE IS NOT THISCHALLENGE THE PROCESS WILL NOT WORK IT HAS TO BE DISCALE AND YOUR TALKING ABOUT SCALES OF FAIN PLEASURE AND THIS IS ANOTHER SCALE AND THIS DISCOMFORT AGAIN IS NECESSARY AND SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED AS I MEAN THE RIGHT PLACE WHEN IT BECOMES TOO HIGH AND I'M UNABLE TO RESOLVE TO MAKE ANY PROGRESS I WENT OVERBOARD BUT WHEN IT'S NOT PRESENT I DON'T DO NOTHING HERE NOTHING THAT I'M TRULY INTERESTED IN I'M JUST GRATIFYING MYSELF WANKERY IS IN ESSENCE IT'S NOT ABOUT SEARCHING FOR THE DISCOMFORT BUT IT'S A MARKER  AM AND I THINK THE QUESTION SHOULD BE WHO ERE MY SERVING CASE PEOPLE DO NOT SERVE THEMSELVES IN ESSENCE THEY SERVE PART PARTS OF IT SOME SOME KIND OF AFFRECTION OF THEMSELVES AND THIS SEPARATION OF ONESELF FROM ONESELFES AND THIS IS ALSO A RESULT OF THE PRACTICE A GOOD PRACTICE AN I THINK IT MAY BE THE BIGGEST GIFT I RECEIVED FROM THE PRACTICE IS IM I AM I CAN SAY ALTHOUGH IT WILL TAKEN MAY BE A CERTAIN CONTEXT I'M NOT MY FRIEND AT TIMES I AM BUT MANY TIMES I'M NOT MY FRIEND AND BY CREATING THI SEPARATION I CAN ASSUME A CERTAIN STABILITY IN THE FACE OF EVERYTHING ALL THE WAY UP TO OUR OWN MORTALITY AND THES WHICH IS AND MAY BE BEYOND WHO KNOWS  IT WAS IM A STRIKING MOMENT FOR ME EARLIER TO DAY WHEN I WAS REALLY CHALLENGED WITH ONE OF THE A PRACTICEAS WE WERE DOING AND YOU SAID THIS IS EXACTLY THE WHAT I EXPERIENCE THIS MORNING ENTER THAT'S WHAT YOU SAIDT AN I COULDN'T IMAGINE THEYOUERE HAVING CHALLENGES DOING THE WHAT I WAS ATTEMPTING TO AND OF COURSE YOU WERE WHAT I BELIEVE WHAT YOU WERE REFERRING TO IS THAT YOU HAD PUT YOURSELF AT THAT EDGE EARLIER IN THE DAY IN WHICH YOU WERE MAKING FAILURES YOU WERE YOU WERE FAILING TO EXECUTE THE WAY THAT YOU WERE ATTEMPTING TO EXECUTE MOVEMENT I JU JUST AT TO INJECT SOME NEUR SCIENCE AND NEUROPLASTICITY THERE I CAN'T HELP MYSELF TIS WHAT I DO AFTER ALL THERE ARE BEAUTIFUL DATA IN ANIMALS AND HUMAN SHOWING THAT IN THE SECONDS AND MINUTES AFTER A FAILED ATTEMPT AT A MOTOR EXECUTION OF SOMETHING THE FOREBRAIN IS IN A HEIGHTENED STATE OF FOCUSS AND WHEN YOU HEAR IT SUDDENLY MAKES PERFECT SENSE OF COURSE WHY WOULD THE NERVOUS SYSTEM CHANGE UNLESS IT GOT A CUE TO CHANGE AND THE CUE ALMOST ALWAYS COMES IN THE FORM OF FRUSTRATION THAT THE A WERE AS WE SAID EARLIER INAH THEN AN AS SIGNAL IS THE ONE THAT PRAPS YOU TO EXTRACT MORE LEARNING FROM THE SUBSEQUENT TRIALS AND YET FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THEY FEEL THAT O THAT FAILURE TO EXECUTE OR EVEN TO APPROXIMATE EXECUTION AND THEY FEEL AN EXPERIENCE THAT A NEGATIVE SIGNAL AND THEY LEAN OUT OF THE PRACTISE THEY START TO DEPART EITHER MENTALLY OR PHYSICALLY OR BOTH AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING I THING THAT AM PERHAPS I WE CAN OFFER S THIS UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT EDGE IS SOME PEOPLE CALL ITOR THAT FAILURES ARE'T JUST NECESSARY THEY ARE PART OF THE LEARNING PROCESS THEY ARE THE ENTRY GATE TO NEURO PLASTICITY YES CONTEXTURALIZING OR RECONTEXTRALIZING THAT SENSATION IS SOMETHING I WORK ALOT WITH AN JUST REMINDED PEOPLE AN U O REMINDED TO MYSELF AND IF IT WASN'T DIFFICULT AND WE DIDN'T NEED TO REDO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN WE WOULDN'T BE AGAIN ON THIS CORRECT SCALE WHICH IS DYNAMIC AND MOVING JUST LIKE ROLLING DOWN HILL SO THERE IS A THERE IS DEFINITELY A NECESSITY TO SUCCEED TO ORIENT THERE E CERTAIN OSPECTS THAT YOU WANT TO ACHIEVE BUT THEN THERE IS ALSO THE LETTING GO OF IT AND AN THE DEAMBITIONING OF IT AND THER AND WITHIN THAT TENSION THE PLASAN DEMIN IS COMES MOVEMENT AND THAT THAT'S HOW TE  AND AGAIN IF I STRETCH IT TO FAR AWAY OR IF I INCREASE ONE OF THEM TO MY THEN I WOULD HAVE SOME ISSUES BUT YOU WILL WITH PRACTICE LEARN TO RECOGNIZE THE OCTIMA POINT OF PROGRESSION OF COURSE IT SAID IT TAKES MANY YEARS AND A LOT OF PLAY AND EXPOSURE TO GET A SENSE OF IT REGARDLESS OF THE LAYER IN WHICH IT IS APPLIED SO I'M SURE IN YOUR FIELD AND IN YOUR PURSUITS YOU ARE ALREADY AWARE OF IT AND APPLYING IT IN YOUR LIFE TALKING ABOUT FOCUS TOLKING ABOUT WAYS OF THINKING CREATIVITY ET CETERA BUT TH N IT'S ENOUGH THAT I I PULLING TO ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE AND YOU WILL SEE THAT PEOPLE ARE SPECIALLISTS AND AND THEN THEY DON'T HAVE THE REALLY THE THE REAL ESSENCE OF THE OF THE CONCEPT IT'S NOT THEIRS IT'S APPLIED SPECIFICALLY THE ONE WHO CHANGES ALL THAT TIME GET'S THE GENERAL COMPONEMENT BECAUSE WHAT APPEARS WHEN EVERYTHING CHANGES THAT IS THAT NEU ENTITY EVERYTHING CHANGES SOMETHING STAYS THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO GET THES CONCEPTANT TIS UNDERSTANDING I'VE HEARD THE STATEMENT BEFORE WE ARE JUST A MEAT VEHICLE I WERE JUST A SACACELLS AND IT'S AM AND I I TRULY DESPISE THAT STATEMENT BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL IT AM IT DEPRIVES US OF ALL MEANING N OF OUR LIVES AND WE CAN GO DOWN THE ROUT OF PHILOSOPHY AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S MEANING OR NOT BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT DIVORCES US FROM THE IDEA THAT THE BODY AND BRAIN ARE INTARE CONNECTED AND HAVE AT LEAST EQUAL VALUE AT ANY ONE MOMENT THAT THEY'RE INFORMING EACH OTHER EMOTIONS AN FOR MOVEMENT MOVEMENT IN FORMS EMOTIONS ONE THING THAT I'VE HEARD YOU SAY BEFORE E REALLY OF TO HEAR YOU EMBELLISHON IS HAS HIS IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE THAT HUMAN BEINGS ARE TRULY UNIQUE IN TERMS OF THE ENORMOUS RANGE OF MOVEMENTS THAT WE CAN PERFORM AND YET WE ARE EXCELLENT MAY BE SUPERIOR TO ALL OTHER SPECIES AT CERTAIN TYPES OF MOVEMENT UM THE ONE THAT COMES TO MINE IS WALKING STRIDES STRIDING SO AM MAY WE YOU JUST  EXPLORE THAT THAT IDEA BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY A SHE DOS VERY FAST THE GIBBON SEEMS TO HAVE A LOT OF PROFICIENCY GRABBING AND SWINGING FROM BRANCHES UM BUT HUMAN BEINGS PERFORM AN ENORMOUS WERE CAN POTENTIALLY PERFORM AN ENORMOUS ARRAY OF MOVEMENTS DO YOU THINK ALL HUMAN BEINGS ARE POTENTIALLY ABLE TO EXPLORE ALL THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MOVEMENT IM AND IF SO HOW DOES ONE APPROACH THAT SO AMBASICALLY WHAT I'M DOING IS I'M TABLING A CONCEPT WHICH IS NOT RANGE OF MOTION RIGHT FOR THAT FOR THE GIMERATS DISCARD WITH RANGE OF MOTION I'M TALKING ABOUT THE VARIETY OF MOVEMENTS AT FIRST TE IT'S NOTHIMPORTANT TO WHAT I THINK IF IT'S POSSIBLE OR NOT POSSIBLE OR IF IT'S EVEN POSSIBLE FOR YOU OR NOT POSSIBLE FOR YOU WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS WHAT YOU TRULY ONE TO  WHAT YOU TRULY ARE OFTER AN IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME BECAUSE MANY TIMES THIS WAY OF THINKING ABOUT THINGS IS ALREADY LIMITED I LIKE THE LIKE TO SAY A MAN DOESN'T GO TO THE OCEAN TO EMPTYIT WITH A SPOON A LOT OF THE TYPES OF DRESSING UP OF THE CONCEPTS NOWADAYS ITS TRYING TO FEET AND ELEPHANT INTO THE HOLDIN THE NEEDLE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THE CONCEPT OF PRACTICE AND THAN OUR LIVES AS IF WE HAVE A LIFE WE HAVE SOME KIND OF ESTREAM OF BEHAVIOURS WE HAVE AD THERE IS A ARGUMENT OF FREE WILL ET CETERA THERE IS A MOLTIPLICITY DEFINITELY A MAN IS ALLEGION THAT'S THE THE REAL MEANING  OF THAT PHRASE ONE DAYME WAKE UP LIKE THIS I I SAY ANDRE LETS ME TO MORROW AT SEVEN AN BUT I DONT KNOW WHOS GOING AWAKE UP TO MORROW AND THEN YOU SEND ME A TACKS MESSAGE  IAM FEELING OFF RIGHT AT SIX FIFTY FIVE AND GO BACK TO SLEEP SO EXAMINING THAT AND SEEING THAT I THINK FREEZ YOU UP EVENTUALLY AND AND START TO ORIENT YOU IN IN A BETTER DIRECTION A SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO AND WHAT BUT IN THE RINTATION OF ALSO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO WHAT YOU SENSE AND AND WHAT YOU ARE DEVELOPING AS A E VOR EVOLUTIONARY DIRECTION FOR YOU THIS IS THE IMPORTANT BIT IS IT POSSIBLE FOR EVERYONE TO ENGAGE IN CERTAIN SPECIFIC PHYSICAL MOVEMENT FOR EXAMPLE INS CANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES THE SQUAT IS NOT VERY APPROACHABL IT'S A IT'S VERY DIFFICULT ATHEY ARE MORE BUILT FOR DRAGGING HAVY THINGS AND ALSO IN THIS CLIMATE I GUESS IT IT MAKES LESSSENSE TO SQUAT AND COSEGONAFREIS THERE SO THIS IS AN AND U THAN YOU SEE THE SQUATING IN WARM CLIMATES AND IT'S LIKE SO OPEN AND ACCESSIBLE THEYARE VERY GOOD TE DEADLIFTERS USUALLY NOT GOOD SQUATERS AND THE SHAGGET AWAY FROM THE GROUND YE THE SHALLOW HEAP SOCKET AND WHICH ALLOWS ONE ACTIVITY BUT THEN THE STABILITY WIT THE DEEP HEEPS OC A ARCHITEXTURE OF OF OF THE HEAP AND THE FEMER HEADS THE KY WHENGLLS THE SHAPES ET CETERA SO WE ARE ALL UNIQUE AND THEAR CERTAIN ELEMENTS WHICH LIKE FOR EXAMPLE MY SQUATCHELLENGEIS LIKE FOR MOST PEOPLE THERE IS SOMETHING THERE VAT YOU REMY PEOPLE WHAT THE SQUAT CHALLENGES ER THE SQUAT WAS MY ATTEMPT TO BRING A NEW FRESH STATE OF MIND IN TO THE WORD SQUAT ANDNOT AS A STRENGTH ELEMENT NOT BUT IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL RESTING POSITION REALLY ACTUALLY SHOULD BE ONE OF THE MOST ABUNDANT ONES WE REPLACED IT WITH A SITTING WHICH IS NOT REALLY DOESN'T WORK WELL IF YOUARE IN A NATURAL ENVIRONMENT IT'S NOT VERY COMFORTABLE ACTUALLY TO SIT FOR LONG PEERCES OF TIME ROCKS AND DIFFERENT ARRAINS SO YOUEND UP LYING DOWN STANDING AND SQUATING A LOT ALSO WHEN YOURE MOVING LOW AND DYNAMIC LIKE EVEN COLLECTING BERRIES THE SQUAT IS MUCH MORE DYNAMIC AN OPEN AND THEN ELIMINATION IS HAPPENING THERES WUS LIKE IT'S SUCH A FUNDAMENTAL THING AND WE TOTALLY ELIMINATED IT WE ELIMINATED MANY OTHER THINGS OVERHEAD MOVEMENTS BEHIND THE BACK AND ALL KINDS OF BECK REAL AND WHAT I CALL THE BACK REAL AND IS TOTALLY ABSENT IN IN PEOPLE'S AWORENESS SO THAT WAS MY ATTEMP TO BRING IT BACK INTO PEOPLE AND I RECOMMEND I RECOMMENDED TO IN ORDER TO TO REALLY GET THAT TRANSFORMATION GOING TO ACCUMULATE AND THIRTY MINUTES A DAY IN THE SQUAT POSITION UNLOADED JUST RESTING DOWN NOT CORRECT NOT ERECT MANY PEOPLE MAKE THIS MISTAKE THE DIDN'T READ THROUGH THE WHOLE THING IS JUST RESTING DOWN THERE AND OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO BE MINDFUL OF TOSAGES SOME PEOPLE WILL GET HURT IF THEY TRY TO DOIT TOO QUICKLY SO THEY MIGHT NEE THE BUILD UP PROCESS TOWARDS IT AND ALSO I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES STRAIGHT AND BUT ACCUMULATION THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND THIS DOES A LOT OF GOOD FOR THI JESTIVE PROBLEMS FOR LOWER BACK PAYIN FOR HEAP PAINS FOR NEES AND GENERALLY FOR AGING BECAUSE IT'S BASICALLY FOLDING YOUR BODY IN THE MOST BASIC WAY ARE YOU FOLDING YOUR BY IF YOU'RE NOT FOLD ING YOUR BODY YOU WILL LOSE THE FOLDABILITY OF YOUR BODY AND THIS IS PROBABLY THE THE MO THE EASIEST AND THE MOST ABUNDANT WAY TO FALD THE BODY SO ER BUT THA THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING THAT CAN BE VERY USEFUL WITH MANY MANY PEOPLE BUT THERE WILL ALWAYS BE UNIQUE INDIVIDUALS WHICH NEEDS SOMETHING ELSE AND THERE THTHAR THEIR BENEFITS IN EXAMINING THINGS AND ALSO THEIR BENEFITS IN GETTING HURT IC IS NOT OFTEN DISCUSSED ESPECIALLY NOT IN THIS PART SO IIAM ONE OF THE ONLY ONES I AS TEACHER THAT SAYS I INJURED MANY OF MY STUDENTS IN IF I DID NOT DO THAT I WOULD BE TOTALLY USELESS FOR THEM IS WELL THAT TOTALLY SAFE SYSTEM IS HAS NOTHING TO OFFER PRACTICALLY NOTHING IS TOTALLY SAFE AND WE CAN OF COURSE WE DON'T APPROACH IT WITH HE BALSY OR MATHOISTIC THING BUT WE ARE AWARE THAT SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO GO BEYOND THE BOUNDARIES AND HOPEFULLY THOSE WHOULD BE THE SMALL INJURIES THAT WILL HELP US AVOID THE BIG INJURIES BUT IF YOU TRY TO AVOID THE SMALL INJURIES MAY BEO GET THOSE BIG INJURIES IN THERE SO A EXAMINING WHICH TYPES AND FORMS OF MOVEMENT THE LOCATION OF THE THE BODY AND SPEED OF EXECUTION THE TYPE OF ORGANIZATION OF THE BODY WHICH IS A WHOLE THING THAT WE CAN DISCUSS AND ALL OF THIS IS A UP FOR THE GRABS AND I SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO CREAT INDIVIDUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH HOPEFULLY WITH GOOD GUIDANCE WHERE WE CAN GET THE RIGHTS SAD NARIOUS A FACILITATOR OF GOOD SENAREOS FOR OUR LEARNING WHICH IS WHAT I TRY TO DO AND LESS OF TA TECHNICAL STATE OF MIND DO THIS A B C OR YE ARE LIKE CHUNKING WHAT I REALLY DISLIKE FROM FOR LONG TIMES LIKE MANY PEOPLE THEY TELL ME HAVE YOU MET THIS GUY IS AN AMAZING T EACHER BECAUSE I E CHUNC THE PROCESS INTO THESE BEATS A NOT EVEN IN THE CORRECT PLACES OF CHUCSES AN A DOZEN OFFER ETLOCKS US THI SAY THE STATE OF MIND I I TAK ABOUT THE CHEMISTRY MOLT OF MI CALLED IT MY CHEMISTR WOL E WAY AN ETOM AN MOLECULE AND THEN A COMPOUND IS CONCEPTUALISE VERSES JUST CHUNKING SO THERE IS AN ECTUAL EVOLUTION LIKE I CULT IT ALSO SKETCH LEARNING I'M NOT GOING TO TRY TO DRAW YOU IF I KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ART AND ENTHRAWING I'M GOING TO START BY CAPTURING SOMETHING VERY ROUGH AND I NEED TO PRACTICE THAT FIRST THAT DINEMIC AND THE THE BEFORE I GOINTO THE RENDERING AND THE SHADING ET CETERA AND SO THE SAME WAY TO LEARN THINGS SO BIG PICCURE TO SMALL DETAILS AND UNLIKE MANY OF MY TEACHERS IN THE DIRANTAN I SAY AN WAS THE GREATEST RESPECT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHO THOUGHT ME MORE MY GOO TEACHERS ON MY WORST TEACHERS AND BUT SOME OF THEM JUST TEACH FROM THE SMALL DETAILS INTO A BIG PICURE THAT NEVER ARRIVES DGIVEN THE HUMANS CAN GENERATE SUCH A BROAD ARRAY OF TYPES OF MOVEMENT RUN JUMP DUCK SQUAT LEAP IT ALL THESE TYPES OF MOVEMENTS AND DO YOU THINK THERE'S VALUE IN OBSERVING THE MOVEMENTS OF OTHER ANIMAL SPECIES I KNOW I CERTAINLY ENJOY WATCHING OTHER ANIMALS MOVE UM I THINK THE MOST ONE OF THE MORE SPECTACULAR ANIMAL FACTS THAT I WAS SHARED WITH ME AS WHEN I WAS A GRADUATE STUDENT SOME ONE DOWN THE HALL WAS WORKING ON THE LITTLE PEDALS OF THE CAMELIAN AS IT WHICH CAN WALK UP WALLS AND IT WAS A GREAT MYSTERIS WHETHER NOT THEY RESUCTION BUT TURNS OUT THEY CAN DO IT IN A VACUUM SO IT'S NOT SUCTION WHETHER NOT THERE WAS SOME STICKY SUBSTANCE AND IT TURNED OUT I FEEL COMPELLED TO SHARE THIS WITH THEU SORVEN TO DO IT IS I HAVE A FEELING IT WILL LEAD US TO IN TO AN INSIDE OF SOME SORT THAT THOSE LITTLE TINY PETALS ARE SO THIN AND SO CLOSE TOGETHER THAT THE THE CAMELLIAN ACTUALLY STICKS TO THE WALL BY WHAT ARE CALLED VANDERVALL FORCES MEANIN IT'S A VERY WEAK MOLECULAR FORCE BUT STRONG ENOUGH TO STICK TO THE WALL BECAUSE THEY ARE ACTUALLY EXCHANGING MOLECULES WITH THE SURFACE THEREON SO OBVIOUSLY WE CAN'T DO THAT AND YET I SPEND HOURS BECAUSE THEY WERE IN LAUE NEXT WORT WATCHING VIDIOS OF THESE LITTLE CAMELIANS WALK AND THE ARTICULATION OF THESE FEET IS INCREDIBLE BECAUSE THEY'RE LITERALLY ROLLING THOSE LITTLE PETALS ALONG IN A WAY THAT GD  DEFIES ANYTHING ELSE I'VE EVER SEEN I TOLD MYSELF THIS WAS USEFUL THAY BECAUSE I THOGHT IT WAS INTERESTING BUT BE BECAUSE NEVER REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT HOW I ARTICULATE MY FOOT I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT BEING A HEEL STRIKER OR A TOS DRIKER WHEN I RUN AND NO ONE CAN TELL ME WHICH ONE I'M SPOSE TO BE EA YOU CAN YOAN TELL ME BAT UM THE POINT IS OR ISUP WAS THE QUESTION IS DO YOU THINK THERE'S VALUE IN OBSERVING THE EXTREMES OF ANIMAL KINGDOM MOVEMENT AS A WAY TO INFORM THE PLAC SPACE AN THE EXPL RATION SPACE OF OUR OWN HUMAN MOVEMENT PRACTICE I THINK SO I THINK IT'S FIRST IT'S INSPIRING ITS AM IT OPENS UP BUT I WILL TAKE IT AWAY FROM THE ROMANTIC POINT OF VIEW AND I WOULD OFFER ANOTHER WAY TO EXAMINE ALL THIS MOVEMENTS EXISTS IN US IN WAYS IN CERTAIN WAYS LIKE THE WORKOK OF A GROKOVETTSKI ON THE SPINE THE SPINAL ENGINE AND TO SEE HOW THIS ALL WAYS OF MOVING EVEN ALL THE WAY UP TO EXO SKELETONS AND LIKE PRIMARY  VERY ANCIENT OR EVEN SINGLE CELL THINGS ARE STILL WITHIN US TO A CERTAIN EXTENT AND THEN OF COURSE THIS GETS DEVELOPED AND AN LIKE THE THE THE DARWINIAN STATE OF MIND AND GOT STUCK FOR MANY YEARS ON THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST BUT ACTUALLY I BELIEVE I ALWAYS BELIEVE THE NICE I SAW SOME INFORMATION ABOUT AT LATELY THAT MUTATION IS THE HEART OF OF THE MODEL NOT SURVIVAL OF THE FITIS THE AR PEOPLE OFTEN HEAR THE REMUTATION AND THEY THINK OMUTATIONS ARE BAD THERE ARE MAWADABDMUTATIONS AND THEN THERE ARE THABDIMUTATIONS FOR SURE AND IT THISPLACES THE WORD CHANGE IN THE HEART OF IT WHAT IT WANTS TO DO CHANGE SO IT DOES NOT WANT TO BECOME BETTER THERE IS AN INHERENT CHANGE IN IT AND THEN OF COURSE THAT BECOME BETTER AT EXUISE AT FITTEST IS THE SECONDARY PERSPECTIVE THAT ARIVES IN RELATION TO CERTAIN THINGS BUT THERE IS STILL A STRONGER MORE ANCIENT DRIVING FORCE INTO THE PROCESS SO FOR ME THIS IS COOL TO SEE THESE ANIMALS TAKE IT ALL THE WAY TO THIS EXTREME BUT IT'S ALSO STILL REFLECTING WITHIN US SO I LAVE TO DO LIKE EFOREXEMPLE  INTRODUCE WISH PEOPLE'S SPINAL WAVES AND BY BRINGING THESE WAVES INTO THE BODY SOMETIMES YOU GET E WEIRD EXPERIENCES LIKE EMOTIONAL RELEASES AND SOMETIMES   ANOTHER TIMES IT CAN BECOM AN INCREDIBLE TOOL TO HELT AN ETHLET WHICH SPECIALIZED AND REACHD THE TOP OF THE TOP AND THEN YOU DEFRAG HIS SYSTEM A LITTLE BIT AND OFFER HIM SOME FRESHNESS AND AND SOME SAGMENTAL MOVEMENT AND FIRST YOU FUCK HIM UP THAT'S USUALLY THE CASE D TECHNICALLY HIS OFF IS CORDINATIONS OFFBUT LATER THE GROWTH WILL ARRIVE IT'S A FORM OF PLAYFULNESS IT'S A FORM OF EXAMINING THINGS REGARDLESS OF THEIR SUCCESS OR FAILURE THAT MORE UNDERSTANDING THA CHANGE IS IMPORTANT AND THEN AFTER THAT WE CAN ALSO LOOK AT THE MORE COMPETITIVE STATE OF MIND AND THE MORE SUCCESS AND FAILURE ORENTATION AND BUT THERE IS NO GAME WITHOUT CHANGE SO THIS IS THE PRIMARY ONE AND THAT'S WHY I SAY WHAT CAN YOU WANT A SUCCEED IN THE TESKS LIKE WE DID EARLIER BUT YOU STAIN WITHIN THE GAME TO SUSTAIN THE GAME THE INFINITE VERSES FINITE GAME I PROSPECTIN TO SUSTAIN THE GAME MEANS TO CONTINUE TO CHANGE CONTINUE TO TRANSFORM AND THEN TO WIN TEGAM SOMETIMES MEAN GAME OVER M SWISLE WITHIN THAT TENSION I THINK IT'S BEAUTIFUL TO PLAY AND TO EXIST AND TO BE YOU MENTION SOMETHING THAT FOR MES AND INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT CONCEPT A FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS AND MENTIONE SPINAL WAVES AND I HAVE TO ASSUME THATS TAKING THAT THE TORSO FOR US YOU KNOW AMOVEMENT MORE ONS THAN IR ALT IS REFERRED TO IN COURSE TERMS THAN A THINS THATTHERASTHIS PAND SIR IVING I WILL STAY AWAY FROM THE TECHNICAL ANATEMY AND THE TORSO AND CREATING MOVEMENT EITHER SIDE DECIDE UNDOU UNDULATION OR ARCHING AND UNEXTENSION OF THE SPINE THE DORSEL VENTRAL OUTSIDE TO SIDE ROTATIONOL AS WAS SPIRALLINE THE IS IS HAVE YOU EVER HAD THE EXPERIENCE THAT OF YOURSELF FOR OTHER PEOPLE ENGAGING THOSE TYPES OF MOVEMENTS AND EXPERIENCING PARTICULAR CATEGORIES OF EMOTIONS AND I HAVE A PARTICULAR REASON FOR ASKING THIS HERE'S NO RIGHTRO ONG ANSWER OF COURSE BUT I'M JUST CURIOUS WHETHER OR NOT MOVEMENT OF THE THAT'S CALL IT THE CORPES OF THE BODY THINGS CLOSE TO THE MIDDELINE AS SUPPOSE TO FAR AWAY FROM THE MIDDLINE LIKE THE DIGETS FOR IS THERE ANY ON YOU HAVE ANY EVIDENCE THAT THAT CAN EVOKE A CERTAIN A CATEGORY OF EMOTIONAL STATES EVIDENCE I HAVE NONE BUT THE HAVE EXPERIENCE AND I HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT IT  ETHEROLE WHIS KNOWN TOCREATED ROLTHING OR STRUCTURAL INTEGRATIONS TAID THE ISSUES ARE IN THE TISSUES AND AROUND THE SPINE THE SPINE IS US AS YOU KNOWS ICAN TAKE AN ARM OFF ALIM BUT THERE IS WTHERE THERE'S BEEN ATTEMPTS BUT THERE IS NO BRAINY ALONE THE CERIBRAL THING ALONE THAT THE SPINE AND THE MAY BE MORE PARTS OF AND SYSTEMS INSIDE THE TORS OR IMPORTANT SO THAT'S WHY I LIKE TO START FROM THAT COR ENTITY AND THEN THESE LITTLE FLUCTUATIONS THE CREATE ER THEY UNBLOCKS THINGS THAT THEY START TO MOVE THINGS AND YOU CAN AVOID FUNNY ENOUGH MOBILIZING THOSE AREAS BY DOING BIG FRAME MOTIONS AND COMPETITIVE MOTIONS AND TECHNIQUS ALL YOUR LIFE SO EVEN SOMEWHAT MOST YOGIS FOR EXAMPLE THEY LOOK EXTREMELY MO IFE BUT THEN WHEN YOU ARE ACTUALLY GOING INTO THE SMALL WHAT WHAT I CALL THE SMALL FRAME I BORROW DIS FROM CHINESE MARTIAL ARTS SMALL FRAME BIG FRAME THE BIG FRAME IS THES BIG CHANGES OF OUR TOTAL BODY IN SPACE POSTURE AND THEN THE SMAL FRAME IS BARELY MOVING BUT MOBILIZE ING THE LITTLE BITS THAT COMPRISE THE SAME PRETTY MUCH POSTURESO THESE ARE VERY BENEFICIAL AND IT HAS TOTALLY DISAPPEARED FROM OUR PHYSICAL CULTURE WHEN YOU INTRODUCE IT BACK AM THE SMALL FRAME OFFERS THE BIG FRAME BUT THE BIG FRAME DOESN'T OFFER THE SMALL FRAME BECAUSE OF COURSE THE SMALL DETAIL COME TOGETHER INTO THE BIG PICTURE SO IF I ONE A PLACE MY BODY IN SPECIFIC POSITION AND I HAVE ALL THIS BITS MOVING WELL I CAN CONSTRUCTED IN WHATEVER WAY I WANT BUT IF I JUST WORK ON THE BIG ONE MORE MOST CHANCES ARE I JUST MOBELIZE CERTAIN AREAS WHILE OTHER AREAS ARE TOTALLY HELD OR BLOCKED AND THEN I SPECIALIZED ONE MORE TIME TAKE ME OUT OF THIS REALEM AND I'LL HAVE DIFFICULTIES WHAT WILL SIT THERE IN DISTAGNATION AND MOTION MATERIAL FOUGTS TROWMUS THAT'S WHY PEOPLE GET DISCHARGES AM THE BODY MEMORY IS NOT WHAT WE THINK IT IS THAT'S HOW I BELIEVE IT IS TORED IN A LOT EVERYWHERE AM AND I'VE HAD THOSE EXPERIENCES ALLOT OF PEOPLE HAVE THE OPPOSITE WHEN A CERTAIN A  MOTION IS EVOKED THEY START TO UNDULATE THE SPINE SO THIS CAN BE WORKED FROM THIS DIRECTION FROM THIS DIRECTION AND I BELIEVE BY A PLYING SUCH A PRACTICE IT IS WHISE IT YOU YOU BASICALLY TURN OVER THE LAND AND UYOU ARE ALLOWING THINGS TO TO SHIFT AND TO MOVE IN TO ADEPT SO I HIGHLY RECOMMENDIT AND WE TEACH IT IN A VERY ELABORATE AND GRADUAL WAY AND AND AND THIS IS NEEDED REALLY BECAUSE PEOPLE WHEN THEY JUST GOINTO LIKE SOME GENERAL RECOMMENDATION THEY USUALLY JUST GET STUCK INTO A NEW PATER A THAT'S SPINAL WAY OKET THAT'S IT SO I'VE BEEN USING AGAIN THES SLIGHSAND ICE LIKE TEACHING DOZENS OF SYSTEMS OF MOVING THE TORSO AND TILL A PERSON IS FREED TO REALLY MOVE THE TORSO LIKE THE LANGUAGE IS CREATED THET THE THE SMALL ENOUGH UNITS ARE CREATED IN YOUR UNDERSTANDING FROM ALL THESE SYSTEMS AND THEN YOU IMPROVISE YOU REACH THE HIGHST LEVEL OF THE PRACTICE OF THE ANSWER I WEMIT IM TELL YOU A BIT OF WHY I ASKED M SO THERE'S A PRINCIPLE IND IN NUROW IN YOUR SCIENCE BUT ESPECIALLY IN NAUROW EVOLUTION THEY CALLED EVIL EVO SOMETIMES EVOLUTION AND DEVELOPMENT HOW TOS LING IF YOU LOOK IT SO WE HAVE MODERNERONS AS YOU KNOW BUT FOR THE AUDIENCE THAT O LIVE IN OUR SPINAL CORT THAT CAUSE TRANSMISSION AND CONTRACTION OF THE MUSCLES ALAUST OMVOR LIMS AND THEN WE HAVE MODERNERONS UP HERE CALLED UP ER MODERNANS THET CONTROL THE MODER LOWER ONES SO WONE SOMETHING AS REFLECTS IBOR LEARNED WE WERE NOT THINKING ABOUT IT SO AS WE WE MAINLY USE THE LOWER MODERNANS WE KNOW THAS BECAUSE YOU CAN DO AN EXPERIMENT IT'S A RATHER BARBARIC EXPERIMENT BUT IT'S BEEN DONE MANY TIMES CA  CREATING AT THE CEREBRET CAT YOU HAVE SOULD REMOVE THE NEW  QUARTAXS AND THESE CATS WILL WALK ON A TREADMELL SCALLED FICTIVE MOTION NO PROBLEM AT ALL THERE ARE HUMAN BEINGS WHO DON'T HAVE A NEO QUARTEX OR MUCH OF THEIR NEOCARTICS IS MISSING THEY GENERATE PERFECTLY FINE MOVIN OTERN HAS BEEN DOMLOD THAT'S RIGHT AND IT'S TRULY DOWN LOADED INTO THE INTO THE SPINE AND THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SPINER MUSCLES NOW THE MOTORNERONS THAT CONTROL THE ASPINAL WAVES AS YOU CALL THEM ARE OF A PARTICULAR CATEGORY THEY HAVE A MOLECULAR SIGNATURE OF PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGNATURE THEY WERE IDENTIFIED BY HE'S DEAD NOW BUT A AND IT A BIOLOGISTICT COLUMBIA UNIVERSE SEEMING TOM GESTL AND MANY OF THE SCIENTIFIC OFFSPRING HERE'S WHAT'S INTERESTING IN FISH OR IN ANIMALS THAT REALLY ONLY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO UNDULATE AND FLAP THEIR LITTLE A YOU KNOW FINS THOU MOTORNER ONS THAT CONTROL UNDULATION IN THOSE ANIMALS ARE IDENTICAL MOLECULARLY TO THE MOTORNER ONS THE CONTROL THE SPINAL UNDULATION IN HUMANS WHAT'S BEEN ADDED IN HUMAN EVOLUTION ARE EXTRA ROWS LITERALLY CATEGORIES OF MOLECULARLY DISTINCT NUR ON SO THAT AS YOU MOVE FROM THE CENTER OF THE BODY OUTWARD UNLIKE A FISH WHICH CAN MOVE ITS FINS BUT CAN'T ACTUALLY ARTT DOESN'T HAVE DIGITS WE HAVE SPECIAL MOTORNERONS TO MOVE THESE LITTLE BITS THESE BITS THESE BITS AND I CAN'T DO A SPINAL WAVE BUT BUT I CAN DO THAT MUJA'S THING LIKE THE THE BELLY THING HTHAT COMES FROM MOSING THE MOVI E T WHEN I WAS A KID AND OUT MY STOMACH AND  REALIZING THAT I COULD WAVE IT BUT ONLY IN ONE DIRECTION OCCARENTLY NOT UP ANYWAY IM THAT THE YOGIES OUT THERE CAN CHUCKLE AT THAT BUT IM THE OGIES ECATY D WITH TE SIDE OH DO THAT YET OKNOW IF I CAN DO THAT ANYWAY MY SPINAL WAVE IS WEAK BUT IM I'LL WORK ON IT BUT WHATD I FIND SO INTERESTING ABOUT THESE LAYERS OF I DON'T WAN TA SAY SOPHISTICATION BUT THESE  WITH EVOLUTION CAME THE ADDITION OF MORN POOLS OF OPPORTUNITY THESE MOTORNER ON POOLS AS THEY'RE CALED HEIR OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE IN NEW MORE ELABORATE TYPES OF MOVEMENT BUT WITH EACH NEW POOL BECAME THE OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE COMBINATIONS OF NEW MOVEMENT AND SO THE REASON I ASKED YOU WHY SPINAL WAVES CREATE ONE CATEGORY OF MOVEMENT IS THAT IF YOU TOUCH A FISH ON ONE SIDE OF ITS BODY IT MOVES TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE IT NEVER MOVES TOWARD IT BUT EARLY ARE WE WERE DOING A PRACTICE SOMEWHAT SIMILAR OF TESTING THIS SIMILAR REFLEX AND SOMETIMES IY OR SOME WWILL MOVE TOWARD A TOUCH WE KDON'T DEVIATE TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE SO I HAVE THIS AM UNTESTED AT LEAST FORMELLY TESTED HYPOTHESIS THAT MOVEMENTS OF SMALL DIGITS AND PORTIONS OF OR DISTAL AS THEY'RE CALLED FAR FROM THE MIDDLEINE BODY PARTS EVOKE DIFFERENT SENSATIONS MAY BEVEN FAR MORE SUBTLE SENSATIONS THAN MOVEMENTS OF THE CORE OF OUR BODY AND AND THE THE STUFF CLOSER TO THE SPINE AGAIN IT'S JUST A A THEORY BUT UM IN GRATEFUL FOR YOUR ANSWER BECAUSE AT LANDS AT LEAST IN THE GENERAL VECTOR DIRECTION OF OF MY AOF MY IDEA HERE THE CENTRAL OREENTATION IS MOSTLY GONE FROM OUR CULTURE WE DON'T EVEN WALK BASICALLY THESE DAYS IF YOU LOOK AT TRADITIONAL CULTURE THE AMOUNT OF WALKING YOU DO ON A RESTDAY ITS SHUGIAN SO WWE STARTED TO CRATE ECHNOLOGIES TO BRING EVERYTHING INTO THE PERIFERY CONTROLLING IT WITH THE FINGER TEEPS ET CETERA SO WE HAVE INCREDIBLE NEUROLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT RELATING TO THIS BUT OUR CENTRAL PATTERNS SWIMMING RUNNING JUMPING THROWING THROWING IS NOT PUSHING AWAY THAT'S AN EXAMPLE RIGHT LIKE SOME PEOPLE WHEN YOU GIVE THEM BALL THROUG THE YOU CAN TELL IF THEY'VE NEVER THROWN ABAY THE TTRO LIKE  AROLES THAT IS OFTEN AS SAT HERE IN THE EST AND ITSATS OF COURSE UNFAIRBUDY TO IT IT RELATES TO EXPERIENCE RIGHT THAT IS LESS SN LES MAY BE PROMOTED OR OFFERED FOR FEMALES SO YOU GET THIS THIS BEN PERIFERAL PATTERN INSTEAD OF A CENTRAL GENERATED PATTERN THE PROGRESS IS TOWARDS THE EXTREMITIES AM ONE THING I WANTED TO TO ASCUIS I KNOW AN AN AREA THAT IS NOT OFTEN MENTIONED IS THAT SOME OF THESE ANCIENT PATTERNS AND SYSTEMS OUR PRIMARY IN MANY WAYS HENCE THOSE NEWERE DEVELOPMENTS INSIDE OF US OR CONSTRAINT BY USING THE CONNECTIONS RUNNING THROUGH THESE ANCIENT SYSTEMS HENCE WE ARE MUCH MORE LIMITED BY THE GINPOL WE ARE HEACH HIKERS ON A PIECE OF DEANAY  LIKE TO SAY AND AND THAT GIMPOL IS LIKE IS TRIVING SOMETHING SO PRIMARY THAT EVEN WHEN YOU ARE IN KIND OF THE DRIVER SEAT IN YOUR EYES YOUR EXUALLY NOT OR YOUR BEINGTOTALLY CONSTRAINT BY THAT AM AND I WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THIS YA THE RECENTLY WE HAD A GESS ON THE PARTCAST IM IERCHARVIS IS A PROFESSOR A ROCKO FELLER WHO IS AM OFFERED A POSITION TO DANCE WITH THE ALVANAILY DANCE COMPANY SO AN ACCOMPLISH DANCER AND AND COMES FROM ME MUSICAL FAMILY CHOSE TO BECOME A NORL SCIENTISTS INSTEAD AND STUDY SPEECH OF LANGUAGE BUT HE SAID SOMETHING INCREDIBLE SEVERAL INCREDIBLE THINGS THAT REALLY LOOKING FOR TO GETTING YOUR REFLECTIONS ON FIRST OF ALL HE SAID THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SPECIES IN THE KINGDOM OF ANIMALS INCLUDING US THAT HAVE E LABORATE LANGUAGE AND TRUE SONG THEY ALL ALSO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DANCE ALL THE I TURENS OUT HUMMING BIRDS I SHALL HAVE A DANCE AND A SONG CAPACITY THAT PERHAPS THIS IS THE GOING IDEA NOW IN NOUR SCIENCE AND EVOLUTION OF THE BRAIN THAT SINGING ACTUALLY CAME BEFORE FINALLY ARTICULATED SPEECH AND LANGUAGE THAT VOICE ITVOLVED FIRST TO SING TO COMMUNICATE I MEAN TO ANUNCIATE  H YOU KNOW I M YOU KNOW BUT THEN SONG MAY IT MAY HAVE COME FIRST WHERE YOU HAVE SONG YOU HAVE DANCE IN THE CAPACITY TO DANCE WHICH OF COURSE IS MOVEMENT OF THE BODY AND WHERE YOU HAVE SONG END DANCE YOU ALWAYS FIND THAT THOSE SPECIES CAN GENERATE ELABORATE LANGUAGE NOW THE SIMPLE VERSION OF THIS IS OCASE SOPHISTICATED BRAINS TEND TO CREATE CLUSTERS OF SOPHISTICATED CAPABILITIES BUT THE OTHER POSSIBILITY AND IT'S THE ONE THAT JARVIS PROPOSES AND I THINK IT'S IN LINE WITH WHAT YOURE PERHAPS RAISING HERE IS THE IDEA THAT MOVEMENT OF THE BODY AND RANGE AN SOPHISTICATION OF MOVEMENT OF THE BODY THROUGH ALL THESE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS MAY HAVE ACTUALLY PROMOTED OR EVEN DRIVEN THE EVOLUTION OF THE THINGS THAT WE THINK OF AS YOU KNOW SPEECH AND LANGUAGE IN THE ABILITY TO HAVE MULTIPLE A WORDS FOR THE SAME CONCEPT OR TO HAVE ELABORATE ARTICULATION OF SPEECH I FIND THIS INCREDIBLY ATTRACTIVE AS AN IDEA BECAUSE CERTAINLY FROM AS A HIERCHEY OF NEEDS WE NEEDED TO MOVE FIRST TO SURVIVE INTO MADE AND TO FLEE INTO ATTACK IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE TO ME THAT THE LAYERS WOULD BE BUILT UP FUNDAMENTALLY FROM THE BODY TO THE MIND AND NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND SO THAT'S ONE PIECE AND THEN THE OTHER PIECE WHICH UM I'LL JUT SHARE OF FOR ANY REFLECTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE THAT I JUST BLOOMI AWAY WAS JARVIS TOLD ME THAT WHEN WE READ IF AND THIS HAS BEEN DONE EXPERIMENTALLY IF ONE RECORDS THE E M G THE LOW LEVEL MUSCULAR ACTIVITY IN THE LARINGSONFARINGS WE ARE ACTUALLY REPEATING THE WORDS THAT WE READ BUT SO SUBTILY SO THAT WE DON'T ACTUALLY SPEAK THEM OUT UNLESS THERE SOME SORT OF NEARLOGIC DEFISIT WHICH SOME PEOPLE HAVE SOMEOY WILL MUMBLE WHY THEY READ BUT WHAT THAT TELLS ME IS IT THAT LANGUAGE IS MOVEMENT AND MOVEMENT IS LANGUAGE SO AGAIN WE HAVE THIS CONVERGENCE BUT AT A VERY BASIC LEVE ID LOVE YOUR REFLECTIONS ON THOSE ARE ALL HIS IDEAS I WANT SAY AM JUST REPEATING WHAT WHAT HE SAID AND NOT NEARLY AS UM PRECISELY AS HE DID BUT HOW DO YOU THINK OF MOVEMENT AS EITHER THE FOUNDATION OF LANGUAGE OR AS ITS OWN LANGUAGE THAT PERHAPS EVEN DEFIES WORDS OW THOSE ARE BEAUTIFUL PROSPECTIVES AND IDEFINITELY FEEL FEEL THE SAME THERE'S A LOT TO SAY ABOUT SINGING AND THEN SEING AS WELL AS ALSO AS A FORM OL FAIR ANCIENT PROGRAMMES OF TRANSMETION SOMETIMES EY THAT THERE IS DESIN SOME ANCIENT PRACTICES THEM DID E MONTRAS AND THEY PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT THEY ARE TUNTRIC PRACTICES THEY CONTAIN A FORM OF VIBRATING AND BREATHING ALL TIGHT TOGETHER INTO VERY ELABORATE WAY TO PROMOTE  A CERTAIN EFFECT AND HOW WOULD YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN ANCIENT TIMES THIS IS INGENIOUS WI EVEN UNTIL TO DAY WE NEED A FULL BOOK TO DESCRIBE SOMETHING A L IT WOULDENT WORK AS WELL SO IT'S LIKE A VERY ANCIENT FORM OF TRANSMITION THE MORE ACCURATE WE BECAME WITH THE LANGUAGE THE MORE TAD IT BECANE BECAUSE IT IS IT IS LESS OF A MOVEMENT ANTITY T IS LESS OF A DYNAMICANTITY FROM ITS NATURE THAT'S WHY YOU CURE MESHIME US AS ITS CORRUPTY IT CORRUPTS US AM SO DEFINITELY DEFINITELY TE THE THE CONDUCING FOR S OR THAT THE PRIMARY FORCE FOR ME IS MOVEMENT THAT IS EXPERIENCED EVERY TIME WE WE TALK ABOUT MOVEMENT BASICALLY EVEN NOW WE ARE SPILLING IT INTO A CONTAINER TO CALL IT WHAT IT IS BUT IT IS BEYOND THAT SO THAN IT IS APPLIED INTO DANCING INTO SINGING INTO LANGUAGE THERE IS NO OTHER LANGUAGE THAT I SEE AS A PRIMARY MODE AND THIS IS AN NATURE OF SPACE TIME THINGS MOVING SO I THINK I THINK EVERYTHING MOVES INTO THE DIRECTION OF UNDERSTANDING THAT MORE AND MORE AND THE MAYBE IT'S NOT SO POPULAR TO CALL IT MOVEMENT IPEOPLE HAVE SOME CONNOTATIONS AND IT'S O CA CAN THROW AWAY THIS WORD AND PUT ANOTHER WORD AND WE PROBABLY NEED TO DO THAT ALSO LIKE REGULARLY LIKE I  HAVE START TO SEE THE END OF THIS WORD FOR ME AND THINGS GET CORRUPTED AGAIN OVERUSE THE BUSED AND THEN WE NEED THEWE NEED ANEW ANEW WORD AND AND THAT'S EVEN THAT WORD IS ONLY NEEDED FOR COMMUNICATION AND FOR SPECIFIC PROCESSES OF ADUCATION EXCHANGE IT'S IMPORTANT TO STAY WITHIN THE EXPERIENCES IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE TO PROMOTES AND AREOS IN WHICH THE EXPERIENCE IS PRIMARY MORE OPEN EXPERIENCE LETS SAY AND NOT TRY TO HOLD DOWN AND AAND THE FINE AND OVERLYACCURATELY OR IF IT'S DONE THROWING IT AWAY AND STARTING AGAIN SO THERE IS NO WINNING CONCEPT YOU GOT TO THE WINNING CONCEPT YOU GOT NOTHING YOU YOU WERE ABLE TO GRADIT YOU WERE ABLE TO THIS VERY SCIENCE RIGHT LIKE WE GOT IT WE GOT IT AND THAN IT TURNS OUT TO BE NOTHING AND LA MORE MORE TIME PASSES I FEEL SCIENCE IS BECOMING MORE HUMBLE AND THINGS ARE BEING DISGUSTING AND IN IN THIS WAY AND TE BECAUSE REALLY WHAT THE SCIENCE DO REPORTED THE SON CAME UP CERTAIN AMOUNT OF BEDIENCE OF TIMES AND THEN TO MORROW IT WILL COME UP AGAS STUTY STIAKS THAT'S GOOD PREDICTION YE  BUT WE WE CAN GO BEYOND THE RESOMETHING IN SITE OF US THAT CAN GO BEYOND HARD TO COMMUNICATE I CAN'T ULTER IT RIGHT NOW HERE BUT I HAVE TH E EXPERIENCE AND THANKFULLY I HAVE A PRACTICE AND A WAI TO SENS ITIL FEELIT AND TO RE EXAMINE IT AND THEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT AND HAVE SOMETHING FROM THAT AND AT EDWARD WILSON THE GREAT SOCIO BIOLOGUST YET YE FOUNDED THE FIELD OF SOCIOBOLOGY EO WELSON THAY CALL HIM EDWARD WILSON I'M HAD THIS BEAUTIFUL WORD AND INDEED NAMED A BOOK I SEE THE WORD WAS BETTER THAN THE BOOK SORRY WILSON BUT THE BOOK WAS A LITTLE BIT MEANDERING FOM MY TASTE BUT THEN AGAIN HE'S THE HARVARD PROFESSOR NOT ME IM THE STAMFORD'S PRETTY PRETIETARM GOOD THE A THIS WORD IS CONCILIENTS THIS IDEA OF A LEAPING TOGETHER OF DIVERGENT FORMS OF KNOWLEDGE TO CREATE A TRULY VALUABLE CONCEPT WHICH I LOVE I LOVE IT BECAUSE OF COURSE I'M FORMERLY TRAINS IS A SCIENTIST I LOOK AT THINGS MAINLY THROUGH THE LENDS OF NOO SCIENCE BUT EXPERIENCE IS REAL AND OBSERVATION IS REAL AND EVEN IN THE FIELD OF MEDICINE YOU HAVE YOUN AR DOUBLE BLINDPLESSY BOOK CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS AND THEN YOU HAVE CASTE STUDIES AND OF WHAT RIHT NOT OFTEN DISCUSSED RIGHT AVING H M THE MOST FAMOUS EXAMPLE IN NARROW SCIENCE OF A PATIENT THAT HAD NO HYPPOCAMPUS INFORMED US MORE ABOUT THE PROCESS OF MEMORY AND INDEED THE FUNCTION OF THE HYPPOCAMPUS THEND THOUSANDS OF INDEPENDENT EXPERIMENTS THAT FOLLOWED SO YOU CAN'T HAVE ONE YOU NEED ALL THESE DIFFERENT FORMS OF EXPLORATION WHICH IS YOU KNOW I THINK I I THINK WE SHARE THE BELIEF IF I MAY THAT CONVERGENT FORMS OF KNOWLEDGE EVENTUALLY THIS PROCESS OF CONCELIENTS CAN EJECT A NEW CONCEPT AND YET THE CHALLENGE AGAIN IS THAT IF WE DON'T HAVE A LANGUAGE FOR IT IT BECOMES HARD TO TRANSMIT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I FINDINCREDIBLY I'LL USE THIS WORD AGAIN STICKY IS THIS NOTION OF MOVEMENT CULTURE II DON'T KNOW WHO COIN THAT PHRASE OR I SEEN IT IN THE CIRCLES AND ACCOUNTS AROUND YOUR A INSTER GRAM ACCOUNT IN OTHERS I DON'T KNOW IF IM THAT'S A A PHRASE THAT YOU COIN BUT THIS IDEA OF ENGAGING IN MOVEMENT PRACTICE WITH OTHERS WHETHER NOT IT'S DANCE OR OTHER MOVEMENT PRACTICES I'M BECAUSE IT'S SO DYNAMIC I'S THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF IT I'M EVEN TO LIKE TO DAY TWO PRACTITIONERS AT VASTLY DIFFERENT LEVELS OF KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE IN MOVEMENT PRACTICE THERE'S THERE'S INFORMATION I LIKE TO THINK TO BE GAINED FROM BOTH SIDES SI A SO ONE THING THAT I'VE HEARD YOU SAY BEFORE WHICH REALLY RESONATG WITH ME AS THIS IDEA THAT PEOPLE HA MAYBE PRETTILINE YU AS AVE THIS CONCEPT OF I HAVE MY AYOGA FRIENDS OR MY O THE VIBL I DANCE WITH OUR DISTINCT FROM MY FAMILY FRIENDS ARE DISTINCT FROM BUT AS YOU POINTED OUT GATHERING AROUND MOVEMENT ISAN AGIOLD TRADITION AND THAT PERHAPS WE BETTER OFF NOTTHINKING ABOUT PEOPLE WE EXERCISE WITH THEIR TRAIN WITH BUT THAT FRIENDSHIP AND CONNECTION MADE THROUGH MOVEMENT IS PERHAPS THE MOST VALUABLE FORM OR CONNECTION I THINK IT'S A PRODUCT OF THOSE PRACTICES THAT ARE MAY BE NOT SO AWARE AR NOT SO MOVEMENT ORIENTED IN THE OPEN SENSE AND THEN YOU GET THIS SENSATION WITH PEOPLE BUT ALONE WE DO NOTHING SO MUCH SO THAT WEARE NEVER ALONE ALSO N THE INSIDE AND WE WILL MANUFECTURE AND AND PREDUCE ANTITIES THE INSIDE ERE SO WERE CONSTANTLY IN A DYNAMIC EXCHANGE CULTURAL EXCHANGE AND PRACTICALLY I LEARN THIS LESSON IN CAPAUELA IT'S A CULTURAL MONIFESTATION THINGS HAPPEN WITHIN THIS CONTEXT WE RUB AGAINST REALETY WE RUB AGAINST EACH OTHER AND A VERE MOVEMENT OCCURS AND THEIR INSIGHT IS TO BE GAINED AND AND DEVELOPMENT HAPPEN AN AND THEN COMES OTHER THOUGHTS COLLECTIVE KNOWLEDGE FOR SELF KNOWLEDGE WE ARE TRANSMITTING KNOWLEDGE IF IF WE GO ON TOP OF SOME MOUNTAIN TWENTY PEOPLE TWENTY NORMAL INDIVIDUALS AND WE SPEND TWENTY YEARS JUST FIGHTING FOR HOURS IN THE MORNING FOUR HOURS IN THE AFTERNOON WE DO IT FOR TWENTY YEARS BUT WERE ISOLATED FROM ANY OTHER SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE WE WOULD STILL NOT REACH ANYTHING THAT A VERY YOUNG FIGHTER THESE DAYS HAS WE WILL BE UNABLE TO DEVELOP ETHOSE THE CNIQS THOSE INSIGHTS THAT'S WHERE COLLECTIVE KNOWLEDGE COMES IN AND TRANSMISTION JUMPS US FORWARD BUT WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH THEAT STHAING WITH IN JUST THOSE TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS AND NEVER MAKING IT YOURS THAT'S THE THE PART OF SELF KNOWLEDGE THE DIGESTION OF THIS COLLECTIVE INFORMATION UNTIL IT BECOMES DIGESTED AND BECOMES PART OF YOURSELVES AND THEN YOU ARE IT VERSES YOU ARE DOING IT AND THIS IS A CLEAR SEPARATION THAT YOU CAN SEEN SPORTS ON A VERY HIGH LEVEL AND ONLY NOT SO HIGHLEVEL EVEN THOUGH I WOULD BE HONEST IF I SAY THAT SOME PEOPLE REACH VERY FAR JUST WITS COLLECTIVE KNOWLEDGE AND VERY TECHNICAL APPROACH AND OTHERS RICH EXTREMELY FAR WITHIN VERY LITTLE OF IT AND THERE IS ALWAYS OUTLIERS THEYARE ALWAYS THE OUTLIERS IN THAT CASE AND OTHER THOUGHT I HAD WHEN YOU MENTIONED EVIL DEVIL AVOLUTION THEVELOPMENT IS ALSO THE GREEK CONCEPTS OF POYESIS AND AND PEAS AND AND AND A PISIES THE GROWING OF THESEED INTO THE TREE AND THE OTHER PROCESS OF THE MANUFACTURING OF THE CHAIR FROM THE TREE TWO PROCESSES OF DEVELOPMENT EVOLUTION VERY DIFFERENT ONE FROM EVERYTHING TO SOMETHING THE OTHER FOR NOTHING TO SOMETHING ONE IS THE CUMULATION BASED ONE IS SUBSTRACTION BASE BOTH OF THIS PROCESSES RELATE TO COLLECTIVE KNOWLEDGE SELF KNOWLEDGE BUT ER NOT EXACTLY JUST THAT AND WHAT IS WHAT SHOULD WE DO THIS IS A QUESTION THAT MY FRIEND THE RUS MUSSE HE ASKS IN IN IS THE THISIS AND THOUGHTS WHAT IS THE ULTIMATE FOR US SHOULD WE MANUFACTURE OUR CHAIR WOR SHOULD WE GROW LIKE INTO THE TREE CIVILIZED THE MIND LEAVE SAVAGE THE BODY IS IT IN THIS WAY OR SHOULD THE MIND ALSO BE LEFT WILD ER WILD AND WISE  IS A NICE COMBINATION OF WORDS A I LIKE TO PLACE TOGETHER WILD WISE SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I TRY TO BRING INTO THE WAY THAT I LEAVE MY LIFE AND MY PRACTIS AND AN I TRY TO BRING AT THE INFORMATION AND THE WISDOM AND TH AND THE COLLECTIVE KNOWLEDGE BUT I ALSO TRI TO LET GO MORE AND MORE UNTIL AN ESSENCE IS GLEAN UNTIL SOMETHING IS APPEARING AND BECAUSE EVERYTHING WAS ALREADY THERE FOR EXAMPLE IF IN SITTING HERE ALL THE MOVEMENTS OUR ALREADY OCCORRING ALL THE POSSIBILITIES OR SO IT'S JUST ABOUT I NEED TO OPE I OPEN THIS WINDOW THE AIR WOULD COME FROM HERE IF I OPEN THIS WINDOW THEARE WOULD COME I DON NEED TO DRIVE MY MOTION I NEED TO DISCOVER WHAT IS STOPPING IT FROM A HAPPENING SOMETHING IS CONSTANTLY HOLDING AND WHEN WE REMOVE THIS IMMEDIATELY MOVEMENT APPEARS THIS IS REAL DEEP MOVEMENT VERSES THE DREVEN MOVEMENT TIS A VERY WASTEFUL AT TIMES LIKE WALKING YOU SEE PEOPLE PUSHING THROUGH THE WALK INSTEAD OF THE CONTROLLED FALLING THAT IT SHOULD BE FIGHTING PUNCHING TO MANUFACTURE THE STRENGTH AND THEN TO HAVE SOME ONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO FACILITATE THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH YOU ARE NOCK OUT IT DOESN'T KNOCK YOU OUT IT HEATS VERSES I EAT LIKE BRUSELY HE SAID SO THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL THING TO EXAMINE IN TO WORK WITHIN THAT SO AS SEE AM I SCATE BOARDY AM I USING THIS PERSPECTIVE OR AM I TRYING TO TO CONTROL BECAUSE OF RISK AND DANGER IAM TRYING TO OVERLY CONTROL SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY CAN NEVER BE CONTROLLED THE WAY TO CONTROLLIT IES TO LET GO OFF THE CONTROL AND THEN BOCEY BUT WHAT ABOUT ALL THIS COLLECTION OF INFORMATION KNOWLEDGE THAT I CAN BRINGING WHERE DO I WANT TO PLAY I CAN PLAY DOWN HERE OR I CAN PLAY UP HERE THE COLLECTIVE KNOWLEDG IS MAYBE TAKE YOU FURTHER IN AND THEN YOU STILL GO ANEED TO DO YOUR INDIVIDUAL WORK LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE TO ROMENTOUS SIZE ON THAT AND IT'S YOU DON'T NEED TEACHERS WE DON'T NEED NOTHING WE DON' NEED INFORMATION IT'S NOT FULLY ONEST THE E YOU DON'T NEED BUT DEPENDS ON WERE YOU WANT A FUNCTION AND HOW YOU WANTI FUNCTION THEY SHOULDN'T BE DEMONIZED BUT THEY SHOULDN'T BE OVERLY GLORIFIED AS WHEN YOU MENTION ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MOVEMENT PERHAPS EVEN ALL FORMS OF MOVMENT COMING FROM DEEP WITHIN I CUT RAISES TO MIND IN THE NO SCIENCE OF MOTOR SYSTEMS WE TALK ABOUT MOTOR NERANS AS I DESCRIBE T ONES THAT ACTUALLY THEVOKUE CONTRACTION OF MUSCLES AND THEN THERE'S THIS CATEGORY OF  NERANS THAT ISN'T OFTEN DISCUSS BUT CERTAINLY EXIST IM AN'T OFTEN DISCUSSING CAN A POPULAR NOMENCLATURE OF NERSINS WHICH IS THE PREMOTER SYSTEM MOST OF OUR MOVEMENTS ARE THE REFLECTION OF CERTAIN PATTERNS OF TRANSMISSION BREAKING THROUGH FROM THE PREMOTER TO THE ACTUAL MOTOR IN OTHER WORDS WE ARE ALWAYS IN A BUTANTICIPATORY MODE OF MOVEMENT AND AS AND I THINK YOU THE WAY YOU DESCRIBE IT YOU CLEARLY INTUITIVELY UNDERSTAND AS YOU FEEL IT AND AND YOU RECOGNIZE IT I THINK OF IT AS A IT'S LIKE A LAYER OF NARANDS AS CONSTANTLY HUMMING READY TO GO AND IT'S THE RELEASE OF THESE GATES THAT ALLOWS MOVEMENT TO OCCUR IN A PARTICULAR WAY COUD BE VERY SMOOTH AN VERY BOLISTIC WHICH IS THE ANA THE SAME TURNING OFTEN BUT ERE ALL THE INFORMATIONS ALREADY THERE RIGHT AND THEN THE POSSIBILITIES ARE JUST ALLOWED SO I AM ALLOED I DON'T DO FREE WILL ALREADY BUT I AM ALLOWED TO DO I AM THERE ARE POSSIBILITIES AND I AM THEN ING WITHIN THAT DANCE BUT I AM NOT THE ONLY DENSER SO THAT'S THAT'S MY SENSATION AT LEAST WIS MOST AM STATES OF BEING LET'S A MAYBE THERE IS OTHER STATES IT COULD BE REACHED ESTABILITY THAT WILL ARRIVE FROM THE WATERS FROM THE MOVEMENT OF THE WATERS THES HUMMING THES POTENTIAL POSSIBILITIES TO BE IN THAT STATE TO VIBRATE LIKE THISE IS VERY POWERFUL FOR OUR LIVES TO WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND FEEL THAT LOT LEAVING THING IS THE FEELING OF MOVEMENT AND FOR MEIS A RESULT OF THE PRACTICE AND SO THEN IT'S EASY NOT TO STAGNATE AND THEN THE MIND CAN STAY FOCUS FOR HOURS LIKE WE'VE DONE TO DAY AND I CAN LISTEN AND TUNE IN AND I WON'T LOSE YOU WHICH IS VERY DIFFICULT LIKE I HAVEN'T HAD THE GOOD CONVERSATION HERE  IN THE YOUES IT'S VERY DIFFICULT AND I 'VE HAD YOUR ATTENTION AND YOUR LISTENING BUT IT'S RARE YIT'S WARE THAT SOMEBODY CAN DO THAT AND AN AN IT'S A STRUGGLE ALWAYS A STRUGGLE BUT IT'S DEFINITELY MY TRICK MY DIRTY TRICK IN TE UM YOU SAID YOU'RE ALOUD AND AGAIN WHEM TAKING SOME OF THE LANGUAGE IN AND WHAT YOU REPORT ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE AND AND TURN AMAPIT TO SOME CONCEPTS THAT RELATE O NEURAL CIRCUITS IN IN THE PRINCIPLES OF NERSE SCIENCE WE TALK ABOUT INSTRUCTIVENESS VERSES PERMISSIVENESS THERE INSTRUCTIVE CUS LIKE FOR INCE TANCE THE THE ABILITY TO PICK UP THIS PAN WRIT THERE'S AN INSTRUCTION CLEARLY THERE'S A  MOTOR COMMAND BUT THAT'S JUST ONE WAY OF LOOKING AT IT THE WAY IT ACTUALLY WORK SOS THAT THERE'S A PREMOTER SYSTEM THAT'S ALREADY GENERATING THAT MOVEMENT AND WHAT WE'VE DONE AS WE'VE FLUNG OPEN THE GATE AND ALLOWED THAT MOVEMENT TO OCCUR PRECISELY SERFING IT RIGHT SERFING THAT CURRENT OR THES CURRENT OR ANOTHER CURRENT OR OPENING THE WINDOW EXACTLY AND IF YOU LOOK AT UM THE FORMAL STUDY OF OF MOVEMENT AND IMPROVEMENT OF MOVEMENT AT THE MOST BASIC EXAMPLE I GAN GIV IS A LIKE A TENNESS SERVE AM THEN E IF YOU JUST THEY'VE DONE THIS MANY TIMES OVER YOU MAP THE TRAJECTORIES AND IN A NOVICE TH THE LINES ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE IT ENDS UP LOOKING MORE LIKE A LIKE E A TANGLE OF RUBBER BAN BALL R WEREAS IN THE FETTER OR THE EXPERT YOU ALMOST WONDER IF IT'S JUST ONE LINE BEING DRAWN BUT IT'S IT THE TRAJECTORIES ARE INCREDIBLY STERIOTYPE THAT'S THE REFLECTION OF ONE LITTLE NARROW GAT OPENING AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN LACOLETTE LET ME LET ME INJECT SOMETHING HERE FROM AN OLD NAUROLOGISEYOU CAN SAY BURNSHTING AND THE TE SOVIET AND HE TALKED ABOUT THE GREES OF FREEDOM AND THAT THEY DID IN ORDER TO INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY IN SOV IT UNION I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WE'VE HEARD THIS STORY EHE WAS BROUGHT IN TO EXAMINE THE MOVEMENT HABITS OF THE WORKERS AND HE COLLECTED SOME SOME INFORMATION HE PLACED HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST ECINETIC I DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S CALLED IN ENGLISH TE CINETICA CAPTURING OF MOTION WIS MOVING PICTURES IN THAT TIME AND SO HE PLACED THESE THOUGHTS AND THEY TOOK THES SAY FOTOS WHICH BECAME KIND OF MOVING AND WHAT YOU DISCOVER WAS SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING THE ACUROUS Y OF THE HEAT OF THE SLEDGE HAMMER INCREASED WHILE THE VARIANCS IN THE VERIOUS POINT BECAME MORE NOTLESS SO IT WASN'T HA FIXED PATTERN IT WAS A METAPATER AND THESE PATTERN IS ADJUSTED IN THIS WAY TO ACHIEVE THE PERFECT EXECUTION THOSE WO ERE VERY EARLY FINDINGS I'M NOTURE HOW DOES THAT SIT WITH EVERYTHING BUT I AM SURE THERE IS SOME TRUTH TRUIT FOR MY EXPERIENCE BHASICALLY THE SELF ADJUSTING DYNAMIC NATURE OF THE SYSTEM ALLOWS YOU TO REACH A VERY CONSTANT AND STABLE AND RESOLT BY BEING SO OPEN AND LETTING GO OFF YOUR CONTROL AM THE EXAMPLE YOU GIVE FITS VERY WELL WITH THE ONE THAT I DESCRIBED BEFORE BECAUSE IN AM RECALLING THE EXPERIMENT AT PUVONA LOOK THIS UP ATS A PAPER WILL PUT IT IN THE SHOWN OF CAPTION HEGI ALSO HAPPENS TO BE HARVORD AM NAM BENSOLEVSKY  HUNGARYNAM CLEARLY PRONOUNCING HIS NAME WRONG BUT I KNOW TENS A AND I REMEMBER THE SLIDE IN MY MIND'S EYE AND THE TRAJECTORY THAT WAS MAPPED WITH THE MOVEMENT OF THE TENES RACKET NOT OF THE LIMBS THEMSELVES IN THE FETERAR CASE SO THAT I THINK A LINES WELL WITH WHAT YOU'ARE DESCRIBING THE OTHERS THAT EXPLORATION OF DEGREES OF FREEDOM IS WHERE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR AM I REAL ADVANCEMENT AND EXPANSION OF SKILL SHOWS UP AS A I THINK THE WAY IT'S BEEN DESCRIBED TO ME IS THAT WE GO FROM UNSKILLED TE SKILLED AND THEN THERE'S MASTERY AND THEN THERE'S THIS TOP TERE WHICH IS THIS BEAUTIFUL THIN LAYER THAT SO FEW PEOPLE OCCUPY WHICH IS VIRTUOSITY IN WHICH THE PRACTITIONER INVITES VARIABILITY AND CHANCE BACK IN AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO TRULY NEW THINGS N I I AM IT IT MADE ME THINK MANY YEARS AGO THIS THIS KIND OF VE THINKING ABOUT SO WHAT IS THAT ENTITY BECAUSE OFVIOUSLY TS NOT TECHNIQUE AND IT WOULDN'T EVEN BE HONEST TO SAY IT'S A MOVEMENT PATTERN THERE IS TOO MUCH DIVERSITY THERE I STARTED TO TALK ABOUT E I CALL TIT MOVEMENT SLEEVES OR METATECNIQUE BUT IT THE WOR TECHNIQIS ALREADY MISLEEDING AM SO THTHERE IS SOME KIND OF A DYNAMIC SLEEVE IN WHICH YOU CAN MOVI AS LONG AS YOUARE NOT OUT OF THIS SLEEVE YOUARE STILL WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF ACHIEVING THE RESULT THAT YOU'RE AFTER AND THEN THERE THERE IS ALL THIS ADEPTATION OF ALL THESE ELEMENTS INSIDE TO KEEP YOU IN THE SLEEVE THE SLEEVE IS NOT CONSTRICTED AS WE ONCES THOUGHT OH BEAUTIFUL TECNIQUE THER MANY WAYS TO SKIN ACET AM AN AND THAT EXPERIENCE AND THAT VARIETY THAT DIVERSITY GOES INTO VIRTUOSITY IT'S TOO TRUE FREEDOM BECAUSE YOUR FOCUSS IS ON THE WRIGHTING YOU DON'T POINT AT THE MOON LOOK AT YOUR FINGER AND AN THAT'S REALLY IN ESSENCE EBEING A VIRTUOSO FOR FOR ME LIKE MUSTERY THAT SAY IF THERE IS SUCH A THING ALL THIS I DO BELIEVE THERE IS SUCH A THING AND I'LL UM FLATTER IN ATTEMPT TO EMBARRASS YOU BY SAYING I THINK THAT I'M NOT ALONE IN VIEWING YOU AS A VIRTUE ORSO MOVEMENT I THINK BUT THAT'S I THINK THAT'S WHAT COMES TO MIND BECAUSE THERE'S THIS NOTION THAT NOT EVERYTHING IS PRETPLANNED THAT EVEN YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO NEXT UNTIL THE MOMENT OF EXECUTION BUT THAT HERE I'M PROJECTING MY OWN MY OWN ASSUMPTIONS AH I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT MIND SETS IN APPROACHING PRACTICE E A BIT MORE BUT I WANT TO WEIGHE INTO THAT TERRITORY BY TALKING ABOUT VISION IN THE EYES SOMETHING THAT WE BOTH ASHERE IT DEEP INTEREST IN I FROM THE BACKGROUND OFVISIAL NOR SCIENCE BUT ALSO FROM THE REALIZATION THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE ABILITY TO ADJUST THE APERTURE OF OUR VISUAL WINDOW WE CAN FOCUS VERY NARROWLY WE CAN FOCUSS VERY BROADLY O SOMETHING I ENCOUNTERED I THINK FIRST IS A CHILD REALIZING THAT I COULD SPEND ALL DAY WATCHING ANTS PLAY IN A VERY FIND DOMAIN AN AND LOOK UP AND GOINSIDE ANDRELIZES A WHOLE WORLD AND REALIZING WHIL I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO CONSUME THE FULL RANGE OF EXPERIENCES AT ANY ONE MOMENT THEIR AUNTS PROBABLY IN THE CORNER OF THIS ROOM DOING THEIR THING AND SO TOO ARE OUR APPROACH TO MOVEMENT CAN BE AS YOU MENTION VERY BIG AND DYNAMIC IN TERMS OF THE BROAD MOVEMENTS OF OUR LIMBS OR FINE ARTICULATION WHEN YOU BEGIN A PRACTICE OR I AND AS YOU MOVE THROUGH A PRACTICE DO YOU APPLY A REGIMENTED A WAY OF FOCUSSING YOUR VISION ARE YOU IN PANORAMIC VISION ARE YOU IN IN A VERY NARROW FIELD OF YOU OR DOES IT ENTIRELY DEPEND AND FOR THE PERSON WHO'S A TRUE BEGINNER TRUE NOVICE LIKE MYSELF HOW SHOULD I SHOW UP TO THE PRACTICE WITH MY EYES THE EYES ARE EE GOOD STARTING POINT AS YOU HELPELATE A LOT OF PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND AND THAT WHEN YOU ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTIES WITH OTHER LAYERS IT'S A VERY POWERFUL TO START WATH THE EYES AND OTHER THING IMPORTANT TO UN UNDERSTAND AND TO EXPERIENCE YOU YOU CAN'T BELIEVE ME OR AMYOU GOT O EXAMINE IT FOR YOURSELF WE DO NOT MOVE THE EYES AS WELL AS WE THINK WE DO CAUSE AS LONG AS YOU CAN SEE MOVE THE EYES PEOPLE NEVER THINK ABOUT IT THAT IT CAN BE TRAINED THAT IT CAN BE IMPROVE AT CETERA AND THER EFFECTOF IT ARE FAR REACHING THE EYES LEAD TO THE EANOR EYE YOU CAN THINK OF IT IN A BEAUTIFUL AND METAPHORICAL WAY AND ITS A REPRESENTATION OF THE WAY THAT WE USE VARIOUS COGANT EVEN MIND PROCESSES AND ALSO OF COURSE AFFECT THE BODY THE EYES LEAD IN MANY WAYS AND THE HEAD IS ALSO A VERY BECAUSE ALL OF THISE INPUTS ARE COMING IN HERE SO IT'S VERY EASY TO LEAD THE BODY IN A IF YOU LOOK AT A CENTRED WAHT FROM THE HEAD IT'S A VERY POERFUL AND EASY THING FOR EXAMPLE YOU WHEN WHEN YOU TEACH BOXERS HOW TO BOB USUALLY EATS NOT DONE IN THE WAY THAT I I BELIEVE IT IT SHOULD BE DONE YOU TEACH IT WITH THE PARIFERY THEY TEACH IT FROM THE FEET BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE IDEA WHICH IS CORRECT THAT YOU NEED DO IT IN SPACIAL CONDITIONS IN MOVEMENT IN SPACE BUT IN REALITY THE HEAD WILL ORGANIZE THE FEET FOR YOU INSTEAD YOU ARE NOW PUTTING TWO ELEMENTS TOGETHER AND THEN WITH THE YEARS OF PRACTICE YOU HOPE OF TYING THEM TOGETHER WELL I PREFER TO DO SOMETHING ELSE BECAUSE YOU FELL PUL YOUR HEAD NOW TO THE SIDE YOU WILL IMMEDIATELY START TO ORGANIZE YOUR FEET UNDER IT SO I GIVE YOU JUST ONE ELEMENT TO MANIPULATE TA SYSTEM FROM THAT'S HOW I WOULD TEACH SOME ONE SOMETHING LIKE THIS MANY ANIMALS HUNT TWITH THE HEAD YOU CAN SEE THAT THE BODY RUNNING FORWARD WHILE THE HEAD IS TURNING TO THESIDE THE WHOLE THING FARLOWS AFTERWARDS SO IT'S A VERY POWERFUL WAY TO ADDRESS MOVEMENT NOT ONLY ONE AND THERE MANY MODES THANKFULLY AND WERE VERY ADAPTABLE IN DHAT BUT DEFINITELY A PRIMARY ONE AND THEN THE USE OF THE EYES IS OF COURSE MAY BE THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENT WITH THAT USUALLY YERE WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY ABOUT THE EYES AS THATS SOR HOW DO YOU COME IN WELL IT THE PENSON THE PRACTICE YOU NEED TO START TO HAVE SOME KIND OF A CHECKLIST OF WHAT YOURE LOOKING TO DO AND THEN BY THIS YOU CAN START TO TAILOR THE WAY THAT YOU USE YOUR EYES THE SAME THING I DO FOR POSTURE THE SAME THING I DO FOR STANDS THE SAME SING EVENTUALLY I DO FOR STATE AND THERE IS DIFFERENT FLAVOURS THERE IS NO CORRECT WAY TO USE THE I SOMETIMES I'S VERY PERIFERAL SOFT OPEN A WERNESS ORIENTATION SOMETIMES ITS VERY FOCUST NOTICE THEM PULLING THESE TO OPPOSITE A WERNESS AND FOCUSS WHICH IS OFTEN PUT TOGETHER AND CONFUSED BUT AM AND THEN THE EYES ARE LIKE THE IMMEDIATE AND THE EASIEST ENTRY POINT INTO THAT ANOTHER THING IS THE PLACEMENT OF THE HEAD AND THE EYES LIKE FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE LOWER OUR CHIN WE SEEM TO SEE BETTER WHEN WE RAISE THE EYEBROWS THERE IS TOO MUCH EXPOSURE OF TOP LIGHT SORCES AND SO PEOPLE WOULD USUALLY WHEN LOOKING INTO THE DISTANCE WILL TIL THER THEIR CHIN IN AND IN MANY CENARIOUS TILTING OF THE TE CHIN TO THE SIDE OR PLACING JUST LIKE LISTENING WITH THE EAR PLACING A CERTAIN I OR DOMINANT EYE DEPENDING ON VERIOUS AND ARIOUS AND THIS IS ALL LIKE INFORMATION THAT I CAN COME IN CERIBRALLY AND THINK ABOUT AND JUMP MIGHT PRACTICE FORWARD INSTEAD OF JUST LETTING THE EXPERIENCE TEACH ME THAT I'M USING SOME KIND OF A THINKING PROCESS TO IMPROVE AND THIS IS NOT CHEATING THIS IS GREAT WELEAT WORK WE GOT TO TRY ISA IT'S A PROCESS THOSE ARE SOME THOUGHTS ANDND START TO PLAY WAS YE UM I LOVE THAT YOU AMENTION CHIN DOWN BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE A NATURAL REFLECTS WHEN CHIN GOES DOWN ICE GOES UP AND THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE EN HEAD GOES UP A EYES GO DOWN AND THERE ARE TWO SEPARATE CLUSTERS OF NURANS IN THE THET'S CRANIAL NERVE NUWCLY IE THAT AAS WE CALL THEM WHEN EYES ARE UP IT INCREASES OUR LEVEL OF ALERTNESS OVER ALL THIS IS IT NOT YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT WO SCIENCE THIS IS THIS IS THE THE FUNCTION OF THESE CRANIAL NERVE NUCLY I WHEND OUR EYES RE DOWN WE GO INTO STATES OF MORE CALM AND QUIASCENCE AND THIS MAKES PERFECT SENSE YOU KNOW THEN THE IYLADS USUALLY GO DOWN AND THEN PEOPLE FALL ASLEEP EYES UP DOES NOT MEAN HEAD UPS AS YOU SAID THERE'S A VERY DYNAMIC CONTROL OVER THE AMOUNT OF LUMINOUS TEPENDING IN THE ENVIRONMENT SO THAT AND THEN AS YOU MENTION THIS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FOCIS IN AWARENESS I THINK IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT ONE WHEN WE ARE IN THIS MORE PANORAMIC SOFPH GAYS AS AM AND BROAD AWAREINESS BIG BIG SUATHS OF VISUAL FIELD AS WE SAY THE NURONS THAT CONTROL THAT COME THROUGH A PATHWAY CALL MAGNO CELLAR PATHWAY IN ANY EVENT THOSE NURONS ARE MUCH THICKER THICKER CABLES THEY TRANSMIT MUCH FASTER JUST LIKE THICK A PIPES CAN CARRY MORE WATER ORE QUICKLY AND YOU REACTION TIME IS FOR AT LEAST FOUR TIMES WHAT IT IS IN THIS AWAREINESS SMODE THEN IT IS WHEN YOU'RE NARROWLY FOCUST ON SOMETHING AND THIS IS COUNTER INTUITIVE I THINK TO LOT OF PEOPLE BUT THE PERSON WHO IS RUNNING TO CATCH THE BALL IS NOT TRACKING THE THE BALL IN A SMOOTH MOVEMENT THO MOST OF THEIR VISION IS IN PERIFROVISION WHEN WE DRIVE WERE IN THIS PERFROVISION AND OUR REACTION TIMES ARE MUCH MUCH FASTER SO I DON'T KNOW IF UM I'M RELUCTANT TO A ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO SHIFT TOWARD A PRERTYGULAR TYPE OF PRACTICE TOWARD O PRICILIRT APE OF VISION I THINK WHAT YOU AND I I I HOPE AGREE ON CRECK ME FROM WRONG IS THAT EXPLORING THESE DIFFERENT EXTREMES AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN IS WERE THE REAL VALUE IS PANORAMIC FOCISS EYES HEAD UP EYES DOWN HAD DOWN EYES UP PLAYING WITH IT AND EXPLORING IT AND IN AS OPPOSED TO FOR THE FIRST TEN MINUTES OF PRACTICSE BEIN PANORAMIC VISION ANOTHER SORT OF ATE EARLIER TO DAY WE WERE JOKING ABOUT AND KIND OF UM LAMENTING THE FACT THAT THIS WORD BIOHACKING EXIS OR THAT THE OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE IT'S THAT THERE UNFORTUNATE TERMS BECAUSE THEY SUGGEST THAT IF YOU JUST PLUGG IT IN ITS CAN BE LIKE TWO PLUS TO EQUALS FOR AND YOU'RE GING TO GET IT RIGHT EVERY TIME M AND NOTHER PROGMATIC BET ERE IF I CAN OLFERIS AM AM SINCE OUR CULTURE HAS BEEN MORE GEARED THAN PUSHING US TOWARDS FOCUS THEY THE FOCUS USE OF THE ICE AND PRIMARY LAN NGUAGE READING AND AND OTHER THINGS WE HAVE LESS OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK WIS THE MORE OPEN PONOROMI CONE O IT WOULD BE SMART TO START TO BALANCE TINGS OUT TO BE T MORE WHEN YOUARE IN NATURE YOU DON'T LOOK AT EACH LEAF EVERYTHING IS MOVING AND YOU ARE KIND OF UMERSEING THAT AND THEN SOMETHING ATTRACTS YOUR ATTENTION ALWAYS A BIRD YO FOCAS AND YOU GO BACK INTO THE GENERAL STATE THE BASIC STATE WHICH IS OPEN AWARENESS HERE WE SWITCH THINGS AROUND IN OUR MODERN CULTURE WE ARE MOSTLY FOCUSSED AND THEN WE SONTHIZE THEY DREAM WHICH IS MAY BE SOME KIND OF IT SOME KIND OF A BALANCING ACT THAT COMES FROM DEEP WITHIN I DON'T KNOW MAY BE OU CAN YOU CAN SHARE SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THAT BUT I SEE THAT MANY TIME PEOPLE NEED TO THE FOCUS IS OVERLY DONE BY FAR IN AR IN OUR LIFES I COULDN'T AGREE MORE AND I THINK A LOT OF I'LL EVEN VENTURE SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT THE A LOT OF THE VISUAL DEPHISITS THAT WE NOW SEE AND YOUNG PEOPLE BIOPIA LITERALLY NEAR SIGHTEDNESS OCCURS BECAUSE IF WE LOOK AT THINGS THAT ARE TOO CLOSE TO US AS CHILDREN ORAS ADULTS THE EYEBALL ACTUALLY GETS LONGER THE LENDS FOCUSSES THE VISUAL IMAGE IN FRONT OF NEARER TO THE LANDS NEAR SIGHTED THAND A IN FRONT OF THE WHERE IT SHOULD LAND AND BASICALLY IT'S A LACK OF PANORAMIC VISION THAT IS OR OPEN AWARENESS THAT'S DRIVING THESE CHANGES AND NOWIDAYS WE ARE ESSENTIALLY MOST PEOPLE OR NINETY PER CENT OF THE TIME IN THIS NARROW FOCUS MODE YOU RIGHT BEFORE RECORDING WE TOOK A BREAK AND WENT UP TO LOOK AT A VISTA AND TO LOOK OFF TO THE DISTANCE INCREDIBLY USEFUL EASY PRACTICE AT SOME LEVEL BUT I THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT DOING THIS SORT OF THING AND THE WAY THAT IT SHAPES THE MIND AND THE PERCEPTION OF TIME OF COURSE IS A WHOLE OTHER A KINGDOM OF IDEAS BUT ONE THING I'D LIKE TO A RELATE THIS ELEMENT OF VISION TO AND OPEN AWARENESSES EARLIER YOU MENTIONED THE CONE OF AUDITORY ATTENTION THE OTHER SENSE THAT WE CAN PLAY WITH IN AS IN OUR PRACTICE AN END THROUGHOUT THE DAY DO YOU SEE ANY VALUE TO BOTH PAYING ATTENTION TO THINGS IN A VERY NARROW CONE OF AUDITORY ATTENTION BUT ALSO JUST WALKING AND LISTENING TO ALL THE SOUNDS AT ONCE I CAN IMAGINE THAT COULD BE USEFUL AND IN TERMS OF OF PHYSICAL MOVEMENT PRACTISES I WAS GON SAY WARY YOUR EARS YOREARS ARE ALWAYS MORE LESS IN THE SAME PLACE BUT WHERE IS YOUR HEARING WHEN YOU APPROACH YOUR PRACTICE ANOTHER SET OF PARAMETERS TO THINK ABOUT AND TO PLAY WITN TO BE AWARE OF AM ALSO I I HAVE EXPERIENCE THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE BETTER AT USING DESYSTEM OR TAT SYSTEM AND AND YOU WOULD BE AMAZED HOW DIFFERENTLY THE SAME RESULT SEEMINGLY OUTSIDE RESULTS ARE NON BY DIFFERENT PRACTITIONERS AND INDIFFERENT CAN ARIAS THISGOES INTO THIS MUTATION AND CHANGE IDEA WHAT REALLY JUMPS US FORWARD EVENTUALLY SOME KIND OF MUTATION SO AS LIKE ALL OF OUR CULTURE AND PRACTICES AND SUCCESS PUTS AT CLOSER AND CLOSER TO EACH OTHER SO WE HAVE THE SAME OPINIONS EVERYWHERE AROUND THE WORLD BECOMING MORE AND MORE THE SAME LESS AND LESS DIFFERENT BUT THE REAL HOPE COMES FROM THE DIFFERENT SO AND WERE WE HAVE A DIFFICULT DIFFICULTY IN PROMOTING THAT AN AN SO THIS IS ANOTHER THING THAT CAN BE PROMOTED WITH THE RIGHT PRACTICES THE RIGHT FOR EXAMPLE I I I WORK WITH CORPORATES OR EVEN WORKED WITH GOVERNMENTS BEFORE TO BRING IN SOME OF THAT FRESHNESS WE SIMPLE HABITS IN THE WORK THAY OR IN THE EDUCATION OF CHILDREN OR IN IN IN COMPANIES INCREASING PRODUCTIVITY I DON'T REALLY GIVE A FUCK BUT I AM THERE TO GIVE WHAT I VIEW IS IMPORTANT AND WHAT IS IMPORTANT MAY BE INCREASES PRODUCTIVITY AN BUT IT'S MORE IPORTANT TO ME THAT IT IMPROVES PEOPLE'S LIVES WHO ARE INVOLVED AND INPROVES ER YET BEBEING AND BECOMING BEING IN BECOMING A STOOL THIS TOENTITIES I'M NOT THERE I AM ON MY WAY I AM A PROCESS SO THINKING ABOUT HERE THE WAY THAT PEOPLE USE THEIR EARS THE WAY THAT PEOPLE USE LISTENING AGAIN WE CAN TALK ABOUT PLACEMENT OF THE HEAD AND POSTURE AND SOMETIMES ANGLING AS WELL SHARPER AND GOLCHING DOWN SOME PEOPLE TEN TO USE THER THE SHAPE OF THE EAR PEOPLE WIS DIFFERENT EARS CLOSER OR FURTHER OUT THIS IS IT'S RIF YOUARE VERY SENSITIVE AND YOURE LOOKING ROUND YOU WOULD SEE AND THI A IS AFFECTING PEOPLE'S MOTION EVEN THE SHAPE OF OUR FACE LIKE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE VOCAL COURDS IN SPEAKING WILL TOTALLY CHANGE HOW WE ARE HOW WE LOOK BUT HOW WE LISTEN ALSO AND WILL DO THE SAME I DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF OF IT BUT AM IT IS ASOMETHING I BELIEVE IN BUT PEOPLE WILL EVEN MAKE THEIR EARS BIGGER  WE WE TRY AND BECOME LIKE THOSE PHELIC FOXES OR SOMETHING BYT A WEN I LAP YOU DON'T LISE THAT ACTY WHY WE DID THIS IS THE CAPTURE HOR SOUND WAYS RIGHT IMIN A LEANING IS THAT THE LOCALISATION OF SOUND IS PBASED ON A SIMPLE BRAINSTEM CALCULATION OF INTER OR OR TIME DIFFERENCES THE TIME IN WHICH SOMETHING THE THE BRAIN INTUITIVELY IT JUST KNOWS CAUSE IT'S PRETTY HARD WIRED CIRCUIT THAT IF A SOUND ARRIVES FIRST TO THIS EAR THAN TAT EAR THAT IS LIKELY COMING FROM OVER HERE WHEREAS IF IT'S THAT CENTRE ARISE AT THE TWU THE SAME TIME THATS OME IT'S ALMOST YOU KNOW RIDICULOUSLY SIMPLE WHEN WHEN HEARS IT NO PONE INTENDED BUT UM IT'S IT IS A ITINCREDIBLY VALUABLE WAY OF THINKING ABOUT HOW THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE BODY CHANGES ARE EXPERIENCE I WON'T ALONG THOSE LINES EARLIER YOU MENTION SOMETHING IN IT AN IT A FLAG THAT AN IMPORTANT QUESTION FOR ME AM WHEN I SEE PEOPLE WALKING I SOMETIMES OUSOMETIMES I THINK WHILE THEY REALLY MOVE IN A STRANGE WAY OCCASIONALLY SEE SOMEBODY THEY WALK REALLY IT'S IMPRESSIVE FOR WHATEVER REASON YOU KNOW N HE JUS THINK WHILE THEY SORT OF GLIDE ALONG PEOPLE COME IN DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIZES SHORT TOURS THOS LONG ARMS ET CETERA AM DO YOU THINK THAT IF PEOPLE HAVE A A BODY TYPE THAT FACILITATE CERTAIN KINDS OF MOVEMENT AND NOT OTHERS THAT THEY SHOULD INTENTIONALLY TRY AND MOVE IN THE WAY THAT IS RIGHT AT THE EDGE OF THE KIND OF FRICTION AND CHALLENGE IN ORDER TO AM SHAPE NEW POSSIBILITIES OR YOU THINK THAT THEY SHOULD LEAN INTO THE SMOOTH EXECUTION OF WHAT COMES MOST NATURALLY TO THEM I THINK I A GOOD PRACTICE IS TO HAVE MANY WALKS AND BECAUSE THEYE REQUIRED AND OF COURSE THERE IS VERY EFFICIENT AND ENDURANCE STUMMIN OUR EENTED THING THAT IF YOU HAVE THE EXPERIENCE IT WILL NATURALLY DEVELOPS AND UNREVEL AND IF NOT YOU CAN GET SOME COLLECTIVE KNOWLEDGE AND IMPROOF AND THEN THERE IS A LOT OF IT EMOTION EMOTIONAL THINGS RELATED TO WALK LIKE HOW UM WALKING INTO A BUSINESS MEETING AND OR HOW I'M WALKING OUT OF A BAD SITUATION AND THAT THERE IS A LOT OF BEAUTIFUL THINGS TO TO RESEARCH THERE PRACTICALLY WIS YOURSELF TRYING TO APPROACH SOME ONE WITH THE CHIN SLIGHTLY DOWN VERY LEANY AR VERY EFFICIENTY IN THE STRAIGHT AST LINE OR TRYING TO APPROACH SOME ONE A LITTLE BITT MORE ROUNDED FROM THE SIDE AND YOU AND TILTING YOUR HEAD AND YOU WILL SEE TOTALLY DIFFERENT RESOLT TOTALLY DIFFERENT COMMUNICATION THAT HAPPENS OVER PEOPLE'S HEADS BUT IF YOU'RE SENSITIVE YOU REALIZE THAT WHO THIS OPEN THE DOOR INSTEAD MANY PEOPLE YOU START ON THE MINESS AT MY SISTER MY BISISTER TALIES Y ALWAYS AS I STARTED ON THE MINES WHY DON'T I START ON THE ZERO WITH THEM YOU KNOW SO BUT IT'S IT'S PART OF THE APPROACH YOU CAN EFFECT THAT AND YOU CAN START EVEN ON THE PLUS IF YOU ARE THE SLIME AND AS THE PRACTITIONER NEEDS TO ME SO THIS IS AM SOMETHING TO PLAY WITH AND TO WORK WITH AND THEN YOU HAVE OF COURSE BODY PROPORTIONS AND WAYS AND AND WE HAVE ALL THES LIKE TECHNICAL INVASIONS MATEMATICS AND TRY GONE ON ATURE AND ARCHITECTURE THY INVADED OUR BODIES THEY INVADED OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM AND OW OUR WALK AND OUR PHYSICAL PRACTICES THEY LOOK LEANIN R AND ETION THE PASS BETWEEN TWO POINTS IS HA STRAIGHT LINES NOT TIS IS BIL MECHANICSIST NOF MECHANICS NOTHING THER IS A EVEN THIS NO GOSSPIL SO THE WALK IS SOMETIMES HAVE TO GO AROUND OR SWAY FROM SIDE TO SIDE IN THEE RIS COILING AND COILING AND THEIR MOVING BEATS AND WHAT ABOUT THETHE CORDINATION OF MY BREATHING WIS MY WALK BECAUSE IF I WOK TOO LINEARLY THERE IS LESS PUMPING OF THE AIR NATURALLY IN AND OUT SO NOW I HAVE TO FORCIFULLY BRING IT IN AND OUT I I'M WASTEFUL AND THEN THAT'S WHY YOU SEE IN LEST YEARS THIS INCREDIBLE RUNNERS ESPECIALLY LONG DISTANCE DOING THINGS WE NEVER THOUGHT WE'RE POSSIBLE IN THE MOST IN THE WORST POSSIBLE WAY THAT WE USE TO THINK PRONATION AND AN ALL KINDS OF THING LIKE OUR TECHNICAL THOUGHTS WERE THOTILY IS GUIDED AND WRONG AND AN SOMEBODY COMES IN ND DOES IT IN IN SOMETHINSOME WAY THAT IS TOTALLY WRONG ANYHEGETS RESULTS WE COULD NEVER GET THAT THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF PLAYFULNESS EXPERIMENTATION CHANGE BEIN DIFFERENT THE AM AS YOUR DESTRIVEINS FROM SMILING BECAUSE ONE OF MY FAVOR IT NOURO SCIENTISTS HES NOUT IN THE UNERSE CHICAGO I WAS IN A MEETING HIM THERE WAS AN ARGUMENT ABOUT EVOLUTION OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND HE SAID AT THE END AN PEOPLE WERE ARGUING ABOUT WHETHER NOT THIS GENE IN ONE ANIMAL WAS HOMOLEGUS TO THIS GENE AND HUMANS ET CETERA CAN GET VERY DICY AND HE SAID VERY VERY APPROPRIATELY THAT ONE OF THE MAJOR JOBS OF EVOLUTION IS TO TAKE EXISTING SELTYPES AND CIRCUITS AND GIVE THEM NEW FUNCTIONS BUT THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE THROUGH THE PLAYFUL EXPLORATION OF NEW POSSIBILITIES WHICH I THINK MHAPS VERY WELL TO WHAT YOU ARE SAYING THAT AT THE EXTREME THRESHOLDS OF TECHNICAL EXECUTION YOU KNOW MASTERY MASTERY MASTERY YOU YOURE OBVIOUSLY PERFORMANCES VERY HIGH BUT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR EVOLUTION OF THE SPORT OR THE MUSIC OR THE DANCE WERE THE INTELLECTUAL NDEAVOR IS IS LIMITED BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT INTRODUCING VARYABILITY IN THE ATTEMPT TO GET PROPER EXECUTION ID YOU'RE LIMITING ONESELF O HENCE I I WANT TO OFFER SOMETHING THAT IS RELATING TO YOU AN WE SHOULD BE WERY OF TEFINING THE MECHANISMS AND PUTTING CERTAIN MEANING WITH CERTAIN PROCESSES AND WAYS BECAUSE ITJUST HISTORY IN EXPERIENCE SHOWS IT DOESN'T WORK WELL FOR US INMOST TIMES A ORIT BECOMES LIKE THIS MUCH MORE ELABORATE THING EVEN IF WE WERE SOMEWHAT IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BECAUSE EVEN THINKING THIS WAY CAN OFFER A LOT LIKE FOR EXEMPLE IT YOUR ADVISEABOUT HEAT DOPEN MIN LIGHT OFFERS A LOT O BENEFIT BUT ALSO CAN CREATE PROBLEMS AND THER IT CAN INCLOSE SOMETHING A WICH THE THE IMPROVISOR WILL FIND THE MAGIVERS RIGHT LIKE TAKE A PINCL SOME PAPER CLIPIN AND YOU MAKE IT INTO SOMETHING GREAT AND THIS IS REALLY OURWE ARE THE BIGGESTING PROVISORS AROUND LIKE THAT'S THAT'S WHAT MADE US WE ARE THINKING OR THIS IS INCREDIBLE WHAT WHAT WE CAN DO WITH IT YOU KNOW THET THE RUSSIAN AMERICAN SPACE EXPLORATION STORY WITH THE SPACEPAN FAMOUS STORY ABOUS A DEVELOPMENT OF THE SPACEPAN I NOW IT'S A SPACE PEN YO I DON'T KNOW I DON'T I I THINK I THINK IT'S AN URBEN MI I ANKNOW IF IT'S TRUE BUT I LIKE ITS O I USE IT SO THE THE WAS THIS OF COURSE A SPACE COMPETITION AND THE RUSSIANS PUT THE FIRST ANIMAL IN SPACE AND THE FIRST WES O MY CAC MONKEERS YE THA E AND THAND THEN LIKEIN AND THEY PUT THE FIRST SEES SPUTNIC THE SATELIGHT AND MEN ON IN SPACE BUT AMERICANS TOOK THE MEN ON THE MO AND ON THE WAY LOT OF THECKNOWLEDGIES GOT DEVELOPED IN THE AMERICANS BECAUSE OF LACK OF GRAVITY OUT THERE DEVELOPE THE SPACEPAN WITH A HUGE INVESTMENT THE RUSSIANS USE THE PENCIL SO I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S I DON'NOW IF ITSTROU I DON'T THINK IT IS BUT IT IT REPRESENTS SOMETHING IN THE STATE OF MIND LIKE YOU LOOK AT FOR EXAMPLE THE MILITARY EQUIPMENT IN NSOVIET EQUIPMENT IT'S ALL CAN DO MULTIPLE THINGS AND IT MEANS THAT IT'S HEAVIER IT'S LESS SUFFICIENT IT'S NOT AS LIGHT AN BUT EVEN THE NAVY SEALS WILL STILL CARRY A AN ACA WITH CERTAIN CONDITIONS WHY BECAUSE YOU CAN POUR A WHOLE BUCKET OF SEND INTO THE MECHANISM AND I WILL KEEP RUNNING WHILE THEMOST ADVANCED GERMAN ECLELEND COOL AND ECCURATE AND LIGHT WEAPONS FOR EVERY GRAIN CAN GET STUCK AND OVERLY SPECIALIZED AND THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THIS OPENESS THAT WE HUMANS NEEDS TO KEEP AND ALSO MAY BE SOMETHING FOR OUR LEADERS TO BE MORE OF LESS SPECIALLIST AND MORE IN THIS OPENAS LESS CAPABLE IN THIS OR THAT WAY BUT MORE CAPABLE OF DOING THE WHOLE THING E ELL OF THE STORY WETHER NOT ITS LEGEND OR NOT ATS IT'S LEGENDARY BECAUSE IT'S AIT'S FANTASTIC AS YOU SAY NO LABORATORY WHENEVER SOME ONE TAKES ON A PROJECT IN MY LAB I WAS SAID YOU DON'T YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF HOW MUCH TECHNICAL DETAIL AND CHALLENGE YOU WANT TO TAKE ON BECAUSE WITH MORE TACKNOWLEGY ATVENCE ACKNOWLEGY YESTERS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE DISCOVERY BUT MORE DOWN TIME YOUR PIC YO WILL LITERALLY TAKE LONGER IF YOU CANLY USE A MICROSCOPE THAT'S OUT OF COMMISSION THIRTY PER CENT OF THE TIME AN YE JUST HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT SO THERE'S A DYNAMIC INTERPLAY THERE BY THEWAY I THINK THAT SCIENTIS GET IT RIGHT IT'S WHERE YOU TRANSMIT THE KNOWLEDGE OUT O THE SCIENTIFIC FIELD BECAUSE SCIENCE HAVE DEBATE AND EVERYTHING YOU'RE NOT SO CONNECTED OF COURSE THESE CAN HAPPEN AS WELL BUT THEN WHEN IT GOES OUT AND TO THIS SIMPLE PERSON WAS ALL THE EXPERIENCE TAKES IT MORE AS A GOSPEL AS A FIXED THING AND THEN T WAS JUST THA REPORT I WAS JUST REPORTING SOME FUNCTIONS HERE AND PLAY WITH IT SEE WHAT IT DOES FOR YOU BECAUSE WETH OLD THE GREATEST INFORMATION THAT I CAN GIVE THE PERSON WI'LL EXAMIN ITE HAN IT MIGHT BE NOT USEFUL AT ALL FOR ME THIS IS THE PROCTITION AR MAKE IT YOUR OWN GO PRACTICE TRY HEAT COLD LIGHT MOVEMENT A WERENESS TO BE SO ARNESS LY THIS AND THES IS UP TO YOU TO MAKE IT YOURS BUT WE DON'T LIKE TO HAVE THIS RESPONSIBILITY NOW PEOPLE PREFER TO HAVE THE THIS WILL WORK THE FIRST TIME EVERY TIME AND I WILL SERVE YOU BEST COMPARED EVERYTHING ALSE AND AND WHILE THERE ARE MORE RELIABLE TOOLS THAN OTHERS IN MY MIND THE MORE RELIABLE TOOLS TEN TO BE ONES THAT ARE GROUNDED IN OUR INNATE PHYSIOLOGY IM AS OPPOSE TO SOME I DON'T LIKE THE WORD HACK IN FACT I LOATHE THE WORD BYOHACK AS I WEARE TOKING ABOUT AGAIN EARLIER A BECAUSE IT THE A HACK IN MY MIND AS IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS DESIGNED FOR ONE PURPOSE THAT'S USE FOR ANOTHER IT'S IT'S NOT THE MOST EFFICIENT USE OF THAT TOOL NOR IS IT NATURALLY THE BEST SOLUTION WHEREAS BIOLOGY HAS SOME VERY GOOD SOLUTIONS BUT THEY DON'T ALWAYS WORK NOT EVERY TIME I EARLIER TO DAY WE DID A PRACTICE IN WHICH I'M WHICH INVOLVED A INVASION SHALL WE SAY OF PERY PERSONAL SPACE WE WEREN'T STANDING SUPERCLOSE FOR ANY A PRETTY REASON BUT THERE WAS AVERBID GOD FORBID BUT WE A BUT THERE WAS AM WE'RE CLOSE ENOUGH TOGETHER WE COULD TOUCH ONE'S TORSOS AND WE WERE DOING THAT AS PART OF THIS PRACTICE AND  YOU ENCOURAGE ME TO PAY ATTENTION TO YOU KNOW HOW DOES IT FEEL TO HAVE SOME ONE IN YOUR PRAIRIE PERSONAL SPACE AND THEN THIS NOTION OF REACTIVITY I FIND THIS AN IMMENSELY INTERESTING AND POTENTIALLY POWERFUL PRACTICE BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE SUFFER FROM ANXIETY JUST BEING IN A FACE TO FACE CONVERSATION SOME PEOPLE HAVE A LOT OF ANXIETY ABOUT BEING PHYSICALLY CLOSE TO PEOPLE WHETHER NOT THEY KNOW THEM OR NOT AND MANY PEOPLE ARE REACTIVE THEY ARE IN THAT ANTISIPATORY STATE OF SOMETHING IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN AND SOMETIMES THITS RELATES TO TRAMA AND NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE BUT SOMETIMES NO SOMETIMES THEY'RE JUST NOT USE TO BEING IN DYNAMP DYNAM EXCUSE ME IT EXCHANGE WITH OTHER BEINGS AND SO ONE THING I LOVE ABOUT THE MOVEMENT PRACTICE AND HOW DYNAMIC IS THAT ONE CAN EXPLORE THAT SPACE MAYBE COULD I'M TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE YE M TOUCH PROXEMITY ALL THES THINGS AR ALSO THAKING VERY IT IT THAKES A VERY EAR I THINK LIMITED PLACE IN OUR LIVES PEOPLE ARE NOT TOUCHED AND THEY DON'T TOUCH ENOUGH THERE IS CERTAIN BUBBLES OF VERY PERSONAL SPACE ACCORDING TO CULTURE ACCORDING TO ENVIRONMENT WHAT IS RIGHT WHAT IS WRONG AND THEN CAME ALL THE OF COURSE POLITICALLY CORRECTNESS AND HARESPENCE AND ALL KINDS AND THIS IS A PROBLEM IT'S A PROBLEM TO NAVIGATE ALL THIS ET CANARIO AND I THINK WE ARE THAT THERE IS DEFINITELY DESIDE WHICH IS SUFFERING PEOPLE GO TO BE G JACLESSES TO TOUCH NOT TO LEARN B J J THAT MOST OF IT THEYARE NOT EVEN AWARE OF IT BEFORE THEY WOULD GO TO A PROSTITUTE MAY BE IT WOULD NOT BE HONEST TO SAY THAT AM YET THIS IS NOT REQUIRED OF A NECESSARY MORE IN OUR LIVES A CHILDREN WHO ARE NOT TOUCHED THERE IS A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THAT AND THE PROBLEMS BUT AT ALSO ARE NOT TOUCHED THERE IS NOT A LOT OF INFORMATION AND I THINK IT'S NO LESS OF A PROBLEM BECAUSE SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE CONSTANTLY PRESENT AND THEN PROXIMITY BEING ABLE TO AS YOU SAID REMOVE CERTAIN REACTIVITY AND TO LEARN TO CONTROL THAT AM THAT VOLUME VOLUME CONTROL OVER HOW REACTIVE I AM AND IN OTHER SENARIALS HOW DO I REMOVE THIS ORACTIVITY ALTOGETHER IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR PERFORMANCE AND ALSO FOR OUR LIVES FOR CLEAR THINKING ET CETERA BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS MOVING THROUGH US AND IS BEING MONI TORD BY US SO EVERYTHING HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DETRACT US FROM A CERTAIN DIRECTION OF EXPLORATION OR AND IF YOU REACTIVE YOUR SLAVE IT IT BECOMES WORSE AND WORSE TAN WORSE OR AS FOR EXAMPLE A FIGHTER OR A FOOTBALL PLAYER ET CETERA HAS TO NO WHAT TO TAKE WHAT NOT TO TAKE THE FACT THAT YOU CAN SENSE MORE DOES MEAN YOU SHOULD REACTO IT THAT AN THE PRACTISE HELPS THAT BY BRINGING PEOPLE INTO THIS ENAREOS BUT OFTENTIMES DISARMING THEM LIKE WHEN WE WERE WORKING CLOSELY TO DAY AND BECAUSE YOU HAVE A CERTAIN BACKGROUND WITSH BOXIN OUR FIGHTING I CAN TELL YOU YOU ARE MISSING SOME KIND OF A WAY TO BEIN THAT SPACE THAT IS NOT MARSIAL SO YOU CARRY CERTAIN TONE ALTHOUGH YOU ARE VERY KIND PERSAND BUT OFTEN TIMES YOU HELP ME WITHOUT REALIZING YOUR HOLDING MO WITH A LOT OF STRENGTH FOR EXAMPLE AND AND THERE IT JUST IT WAS CLEAR TO ME YOU ARE NOT FULLY AWARE OF WHAT IS UNFOLDING AND IS JUST OF COURSE A QUESTION OF EXPERIENCE SO TO BE ABLE TO BE IN DISANARIABLE DO SOMETHING ELSE WHICH IS NOT MEAR TOWARDS WEING LOSING COMPETITION OR JUST BEING ABLE TO PLAY WITH ANOTHER PERSON LIKE FOEXEMPLE CONTACTING PROVISATION TOK THAT AND PLAYED WITH THAT AND THE WORK OF STIFF BAXTONE FOR THE ONES WHO ARE NOT FAMILIAR SO THIS THIS IS W WHERE I I CALL IT THER THE HIGH BREEDS BECOME VERY USEFUL LIKE WE WE DON'T WHEN WHEN YOU ARE PRACTICING IN DISOPEN WAY YOU ARE NOT BOUND BY SPECIFIC RUEL SET OR WAYS OF DOING THINGS IT CAN BE A FIGHT BUT IT CAN BE A DANCE A MOMENT AFTER ANOTHER THING THAT I LEARN FROM CAPUEL THE SITUATIONS VERY TREAKY THERE BECAUSE I'VE SEEN KIDS DOING CARD WILLS IN BROZIL AND AND CAESARS FALL FROM THEIR POCKET WHY WHY WOULD YOU GO TO WITH THE CAESAR IN YOUR POCKET OBVIOUSLY THERE IS CERTAIN INTENTIONS AND THEN AT OTHER TIME YOU SEE BACK FLEEPS AND BEAUTIFUL THINGS BUT PEOPLE DIE IN CAPUEL EVERY YEAR THER BREAKS TOUH SOMETHING KICKS TO THE FACE FROM VERY VIOLENCE IT'S IV  EXPLORED OTHER MARSHAL ARTS AND BOXIN ALWAS INVOTE WITH AND I MAY AND BE GEGE BUT I TELL YOU THE MOST VIOLENT ARE IN ISE THAT VIPECAUSE IT'S UNKNOWN ONE MOMENT IT SMILES ANOTHER MOMENT ITS SOMETHING ELSE AND ITS UNCONTROLL THER IS NO CATAGOR IS NO WAYS AND ITS STREET PHENOMENON SO YOU HAVE MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS SOMETIMES THEY BREAK IT ON YOUR HEAD PEOPLE DON'T SEE THAT BUT YOU CAN LOOK ON LINE ON YOU TOU END SEE SOME OF THAT SIDE OF CAPUEL WHICH IS ACTUALLY THE DAY TO DAY IN PROZIL AN THE REALITY AND HOW THINGS UNFOLDED SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO EXPLORE MANY WAYS OF BEING WITHIN DIFFERENT DISTANCES AND SPACES FROM OTHER PEOPLE AND  TOUCHED IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND NOT CONTEXTRALIZING IT ALWAYS IN THE SAME WAY I CAN TOUCH YOUR CHEST AND IN ONE WAY I CAN TOUCH IT WITH THE EXACT SAME PRESSURE AND SPEED BUT WILL FEEL VERY DIFFERENT THE PARAMETERS AM NOT SURE CERTAIN INTENTIONS CERTAIN COMBINATION OF POSTURES OR WAYS AND THIS IS BEAUTIFUL EXPLORATION AND AGAIN I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU AND OTHERS TO EXPLORE TE DISCOMFORT FOR EXAMPLE CERTAIN DISCOMFORT E TO BE WITH A MAN IN CERTAIN CENARIA OR WITSH A WOMAN AND TRYING TO SEE WHAT IS THAT BECAUSE IF WEARE TRULY SSTRONG WE ARE NOT AFRAID OF ANYTHING IF WE TRULY KNOW WHO WE ARE AND WE ARE IN THAT EXPLORATION WE DON'T KNOW THE AND RESOLT BUT WE ARE IN A RESEARCH AND THEN WE ARE NOT AFRAID OF BEING IN THAT OR I OR AND WE DON'T ER COME OUT OF BOUNDARIES AND THIS WILL IMPROVE OUR CULTURE TREMENDOUSLY OF COURSE THERE MUST BE AGREEMENT YOU NEVER FORCE YOURSELF THAT YOU MEETS SOME ONE WHO IS ALSO INTERESTED IN THAT EXPLORATION AND THEN YOU DO IT AN AND THE THERE MANY CENAREES TO DO THAT WITH TRADITIONAL PRACTICES LIKE LEARNING TO GRAPPLE OR OR AM GOING TO CONTACTIN PROVISATION AND AND STUDYING THERE OR GOING TO DENCE TO TO LATING DENS CLESS OR AND THERE IS OF COURSE MY FAVOURITE IS TO CREATE AND COME UP WITS YOUR OWN HIGHBRIS OF THAT AND CENERIOUS COMMUNICATING WITH YOUR LOVED ONE THROUGH MOVEMENT NOT SEETING AROUND FOOD AND TALKING MOVING TOGETHER IN ALL KINDS OF WAYS SOMETIMES IT'S WALKING TOGETHER  SOMETIMES IT'S E ALL KINDS OF IT CAN BE GAIN PLAYFUL IT CAN BE ROMENTIC I AND THER MANY SHADES SEX DOSN'T START HERE AN AND HERE RIGHT IT'S LIKE CONTINURMENT WE DON'T EVEN NEED TO DEFINE IT IN THAT WAY SO WITH TINE I THINK IT UNLOOKS A LOT OF THINGS PEOPLE BECOME MUCH STRONGER IN A GOOD SENSE INSENSE OF BECOMING BEING AND THERE WE ABUSE LESS AND THE WE CAN APPROACHEH YET OTHER OSPECTS TO US OL OF THE IDEA THAT THROUGH THE EXPLORATION OF A RANGE OF A PHYSICAL CONTACTS PROVIDED ONE KNOWS THEY CAN ALWAYS RETURN TO THEIR CENTERE SO TO SPEAK THEN THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY THAT OPENS UP I I WISH THERE WAS MORE OF THAT ENCOURAGED IN UM A CHILDREN'S PLAY BUT ALSO AS YOU MENTION IN IN ADULT A ENVIRONMENTS BECAUSE  YET NOWADAYS  FOR ALL SORTS OF REASONS THAT YOU TOUCHED ON AM THE IDY OF KEEPING AT LEAST ENORMOUS NLY DISTANCEIS BECOME CRITICAL THEYR LOT OF ENVIRONMENTS AS SHE WERE HUGGING IS NOT ALLOWED UM I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE IN ISRAEL BUT IN IN THE STATES MANY INSTITUTIONS HERE YOUE NOT ALLOWED TO TOUCH ANY ONE ELSE'S BODY IS USHLY A WONDERFUL STUDY THAT COMES TO MY FROMAN IS RAILLY LABORATORY I GET IM NO SOBLE IS OVER THERE AM WHO AS SHOWN THAT A BY RECORDING PEOPLE'S FIRST INTERACTIONS THAT WHEN PEOPLE MEET IF THEY SHAKE HANDS THEY ALMOST ALWAYS I THING IT'S GREATER THAN EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE TIME THEY WILL THEN WIPE THE CHEMICALS FROM THE OTHER PERSON ON TO THEIR OWN EYES TYPICALLY THEIR EYES ORE THEIR FACE A THIS CHANGED A LITTLE IT DURING THE WHALL PANDEMIC THING BUT THIS IS THOUGHT TO BE A A CARRY OVER FROM WHAT OTHER ANIMALS DO IN TERMS OF EXCHANGING MYCROBYON ELEMENTS EXCHANGING CHEMICALS THAT WERE CONSTANTLY FEEDING AR  SUBCONSCIEUS WITH THE A CHEMICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE CHEMICAL  CONSTITUENTS OF OTHER PEOPLE RIGHT SO IT'S IT GOES WAY BEYOND HOW PEOPLE SMELL HOW THEY LOOK ET CETERA MORE TOUCH SEEMS TO ME JUST A AS YOU SAID PROVIDEI'S CONCENSUAL SEEMS LIKE A JUST A REALLY GOOD THING OVER ALL AND SI UNBET I THINK MAY BEALL SIMPORTANT FOR DISCHARGING DISCHARGING CERTAIN EXPERIENCE IS REMOULDERLING REFRAMING SOS LIKE TOUCHES VERY POWERFUL IN THAT IF IF YOU'RE TOUCHED AND YOU'RE TOUCHING A LOT  ER YOU'RE UNPECKING AND YOU EXPERIENCE THAT TOUCH THAT MAY BE HAS BEEN TROMATI AND YOU ARE REFRAMING IT YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AM WHICH IS SOMETHING INTERESTING I HAVE I'VE HEARD SOME STORY ABOUT SOME TRADITIONAL CULTURE IN WHICH WHEN YOU WERE BURNET BY MISTAKE THEY WOULD IMMEDIATELY BURN YOU AGAIN ND IT MADE ME THINK AND THEN THERE WOULD NOT BE ANY BURN MARKS AND THE WOULD NOT BE THE SAME SIDE EFFECTS THAT'S THE CLAIN IT MADE ME THINK'S LIKE WHAT'S THE SOURCE OF THIS AND I I REALIZE THAT MAYBE IT A LOUSEA SCERTAIN COMPLETION TO HAPPEN THAT IN THE DRAMATIC MOMENT IS NOT THERE SO THE REEXPOSURE WHILE YOUR STILL OPEN THE PORS ARE STILL OPEN ALLOWS YOU TO REFRAIN THE EXPERIENCE AND THEN THE UNFOLDING OF THE REST OF THE EVENT IS VERY DIFFERENT THIS IS IF YOUR TOUCHING IN YOUR PRACTICE IN THE DAY TO DAY AND YOUR WORKING WITH PEOPLE AND YOUR BEING TOUCHED AND PEOPLE COME CLOSER FURTHER AWAY IT HAPPENS NATURALLY M YE AND IF YOU PASS A CERTAIN LIMIT AND IT IT BECOMES TOO MUCH THERE IS ALWAYS OF COURSE COMMUNICATION THAT HAS TO BE PRESENT CERTAIN CULTURES MAKE THIS COMMUNICATION PREE CER CERTAIN CULTURES POST IIS REALLY FOR EXAMPLE POST HERE PREE A SO N ISRAEL THEYLL SAY THAT DIDN'T FEEL GOOD TO MERE THAT THOUT GOODER THAT WAS FINE YE IT WOULD BE MORE COMMENT AM HERE IN THE AIR PORT THE GUIS THAT I'M GOING TO SLIDE MY HANDS UP TOWARDS YOUR CRUTCH UNTIL I MEET THE HARD STOP AND AND THEN HE DOES THIS IN A WAY THAT IS SUPPOSED TO SHOW ME I HAVE NO ENJOYMENT IN THAT AND FOR ME IT JUST FEELS AGGRESSIVE BUT HIS HIS HIS INTENTION IS GOOD SHOWING ME BUT IF IT WAS A LOVING THOUGH YOU WOULD BE NICER FOR ME ACTUALLY PERSONALLY THAT'S IT WOULD BE GENTLE BUT HE GOES UP THERE AND HE SHOWS ME I HAVE NO ENJOYMENT IN THIS A AH THAT'S MY TESTICAL RIGHT THERE SUS IFIT'S IT'S DIFFERENT CHOICE AS I DON'T THINK IT'S LIKE WORSE OR BUT THIS DESCRIPTION CAN BE A BIT DISSOCIATED AND WHAT DOES IT MAKE ME THINK IS IT TRULY WHAT HE FEELS OR NOT CAUSE IT FEELS ROBOTIC SO IT'S NOT SO SOMETIMES I RATHER NOT SAY AND HEN I'M GOING TO TOUCH YOUR CHEST I'M JUST PLACE MY HAND ON THE CHEST AND THER OF COURSE WE CAN'T AVOID TA PROBLEM  I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT THERE IS BUT THERE IS AN EXAMINATION AND BECAUSE I MOVED AROUND AROUND THE WORLD I'VE SEEN MANY THINGS AND I'VE SEN BENEFIT'S HERE BENEFIT'S THERE AM AND AND IN THE PRACTICE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO DISGUSTIS TO EXAMINE THIS I DON'T HAVE A SOLUTION BUT IT'S SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT IT IS SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT AND I'M GLAD YOU RAISE IT BECAUSE I THINK THAT ITSO CLEAR TO ME THAT MUCH OF THE VALUE OF A MOVEMENT PRACTICE INVOLVES THAS I NAM ACANTERACTION WITH SOMEBODY ELSE WHO AS YOU POINT OUT IT CAN BE P NFORMED ON ONE'S OWN AND PRACTICE THROUGHOUT ONE'S TEY BUT THE UNPREDICTABILITY IS A KEY ELEMENT TO ALL IT AND AND IN BRINGING OUT ALL THE THE POTENTIAL THAT YOU'VE DESCRIBED INREFERENCE TO THE THIS NOTION OF TRAMA AND AND BURN AND REBURN AD MY COLLA GETS TEMPORED DAVID PIGO HE'S IM WORKS ON TRAMA AND HE'S A HAS ACTUALY ON THIS PARTCAST HE VOICE THAT HE'S AGAINST THINGS LIKE TRIGGER WARNINGS BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT IT PUTS THE NERVOUS SYSTEM INTO THI STATE OF READINESS AND REACTIVITY THAT CAN EXASCERBATE IM PROBLEMS WHEREAS IM IT'S VERY CLEAR FROM THE LITERATURE ON TRMA AND TRAMA RELIEF THAT THE WAY TO DEAL WITH THAT IS THROUGH A CONTROLLED BUT CLEARLY A CONTROLLED REEXPOSURE TO THE TRAMA IN ORDER TO DIMINISH THE EMOTIONAL RESPONSE OVER A TIME I'MIN AT IT'S VERY CLEAR IF WE AVOID THE THING I WEU SEE WE DONT WOT A REINJURE OURSELVES AR RETRAMATIZE BUT IF ONET AVOIDS THE THING THAT MAKES THEM UPSET OVER AND OVER ALL IT DOES IS SERVE TO CREATE A HEIGHTENED STATE OF READINESS IT PRIMES MORE TRAMA SO I THINK IT MAKES GOOD SENSE I THINK I IMPRESSIONS ARE VERY USEFUL HERE ALSO WHEN STEPPING INTO AN AREA IN WHICH TRAMACHENNICAL AND THEN BY GOING THROUGH THE IMPRESSION THAT IT ALREADY OCCURRED YOU CRATE SOME KIND OF A THORMALAYER OF PROTECTION AM SO I'VE ALREADY BEEN HIT WHEN I'M ENTERING THAT SPACE SO BENEFICIAL OR I'VE ALREADY BEEN TOUCHED IN AWAY THAT I DIDN'T LIKE IF I GO TO A CONDUCTING PROVISATION PLASE AND JUST RUNNING THI SENARIING IN YOUR HEAD PROTECT SO WELL GLAD YOU MENTION RUNNING SENARIOS IN YOUR HEAD I WIH BEEN CURIOUS ALL DAY AS TO WHETHER OR NOT YOU DO VISUALIZATION OR MENTAL REHEARSAL OF PHYSICAL MOVEMENT UM THIS IS A IT SEEMS TO BE A POPULAR IDEA IN IN THE STATES PEOPLE ALWAYS ASKING ME YOU KNOW CAN YOU JUST IMAGINE O A MOVEMENT AND LEARN IT BETTER THAN I WERE YOU TO ACHALLY PERFORM INT MY HUNCH BASED ON AND MY UNDERSTAND A SCIENT OF LITERATURES THAT VISUALIZATION CAN BE USEFUL TO SOME EXTENT FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE VERY GOOD AT VISUALIZATION BUT FOR MANY PEOPLE IT DOESN'T HELP AND THAT THERE'S NOTHING LIKE REAL PHYSICAL PRACTICE TO IMPROVE PHYSICAL PRACTICE YAT THE WORD VISUALIZATIONS NOT GOOD OBVIOUSLY I HAS TO BE EXPERIENC SALIZATION I IN A VERY COMPLETE WAY NOT JUST VISUALLY OF COURSE AM AND UNLESS YOU ALREADY DEVELOPED CERTAIN EXPERIENCE TENGIBLE EXPERIENCE THAT HAS BEEN BET THAT HAS BENEFITED FROM FIDABEC FROM OUTSIDE FEDBECK IT IS NOT THE VERY USEFUL THING TO AND E TENDS UP BEING FABRICATIONS BUT IF YOUARE VERY EXPERIENCE TAND YOU ALREADY GAIND THE BENEFIT OF BEING BURNT HERE OR OVER EXTENDED YEAR TH AN YOU HAVE A CERTAIN EXPERIENCE AND THEN YOU CAN STRENGTHEN CERTAIN OSPECTS OF IT BUT YOU GOT TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE YOU DO NOT HAVE FEED BECK AND BECAUSE OF THE MISSING FEED BECK YOU MIGHT DEVELOP DELUSIONS IT MIGHT BE THAT YOU DEVELOP STRONGER POTHERNI BUT ULTIMATELY THESE WOULD LEAD YOU AWAY FROM THE ALIVENESS OF THE MOVEMENT ITSELF THE READING FOR EXAMPLE VERY USEFUL TO LEARN A GENERAL INFROR STRUCTURE OF THE MOVEMENT SLEEVE OR TE TECNIQUE BUT THEN TO DRESS IT UP YOU NEED FEED BECK YOU NEEDED TO BE ALIFE YOU NEED TO RECEIVE SOMETHING CORRECTIVE ABOF IT FOR MANY PEOPLE THE APPROACH MOVEMENT IN THE FORM OF WAY TRAINING OR YOGA RUNNING UM YOG IS A BIT MORE BY DYNAMIC BUT I FAIRLY LINEAR TYPES OF EXERCISE AND MOVEMENT A PALATON ROWING S KINDS OF THINGS UM I THINK MOST PEOPLE WILL PROBABLY NOT DEPART FROM THOSE PRACTICES ENTIRELY BECAUSE THEY LIKE THEM I'M SPEAKIG ABOUT MYSELF I LIKE SOME OF THOSE VERY MUCH I ENJOY THEM UM BUT IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT ADDING A MOVEMENT PRACTICE TO ONES ALREADY EXISTING EXERCISE REGUME UM I CAN IMAGINE THREADING IT THROUGHOUT THE DAY I CAN IMAGINE HAVIN A DEDICATED MOVEMENT PRACTICE ONE THING THAT I I HAVE STARTED DOING ON THE BASIS OF SOME OF YOUR TEACHINGS EM AND I JUSTCORCREADE THIS IDEAS RATHER THAN STADICALLY STANDING THERE IN LIFTING WAITS I SHAL WALKING FROM AS I ALTERNATE REPETITIONS IT OCCURED TO ME THAT I NEVER DONE AA CURREL THE BICEPT CURL WITH ONE FOOT IN FRONT OF THE OTHER AND THEND I'D NEVER ACTUALLY SWITCH THAT UP AND IT'S A KIND OF AN ODD STANCE TO BE STANDING IN PARALLEL AND CURLING ONE'S ARMS HAVE A RIDICULOUS MOVEMENT WHEN ONE THINKS ABOUT IT S I STARTED I CORPRING SOME OF THAT YOU GET SOME STRANGE LOOKS IN THE GIM BUT I JUST GIVE THEM STRANGE LOOKS BACK SO UM UWHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THESE VERY LINEAR FORMS OF EXERCISE AND UM AND DO YOU ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO EXPAND THE PLACE BACE UM AS IT WERE FOR THESE KINDS OF EXERCISE WERE DO YOU THINK THAT MOVEMENT PRACTICE IS JUST BEST A EXPLORED THROUGH THREE IMENTIONALITY GRAVITY AND MAYBE A STICKER A BALL DEFINITELY A PROBLEM AND IT'S A IT'S APPROACH ABLE PEOPLE WANT TO QUE CPEOPLE WANT A HECK PEOPLE WANT THET THE THE ICING THERE IS NO CAKE THERE IS NO CAKEA AND JUST LIKE INDESTRES OF ICING ICING ICING ON WHAT WHAT ARE YOU PUTTING IT ON SO FOR ME THAT THAT'S WHY I 'M I'M GOING TOWARDS THES SIDE IS LIKE I HAVE MY LIFE NOW TELL ME WHAT MOVEMENT PRACTICES I SHOULD PURSUE YOU ARE MOVEMENT IN ESSENCE YOU ARE NOT THINKING OF YOURSELF IN IN ANY SERIOUS WAY IN THROUGH MY EYES THERE IS A DYNAMIC ENTITY TO YOU THE BODY IS A HUGE POT IS A HUGE PART OF IT COMMUNICATING YOU HAVE GENETICLARES THERE IS A PERSONALITIES THAT CUT DEVELOPED AND BUILD AROUND VARIOUSINFLUENCES BUT THEN THERE IS ALSO SOME KIND OF AN ESSENCE SOMETHING THAT  WREAKS FROM WITHIN THE SELVES AND IF YOU GREW UP IN MY FAMILY IN I GREW UP IN YOUR FAMILY IN IT WOULD STILL BE THE SAME AND THAT SOMETHING THAT ALWAYS TRY TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IS THAT INSIDE OF ME AN SO I THINK THIS PRACTICES THER VERY GOOD BUT DHERE NOT DESIGNED FOR THE GOLD WE THINK THEY WERE DES I DO IT IT ORIENTS TOWARDS SOMETHING ELSE FOR EXAMPLE THEOGA THERE IS A GOOD BOOK CALLED THE YOGA BODY AND WHICH WILL DESTROY LOT OF PEOPLES THE OGA PRACTICE AND AND IT GOES INTO HOW DID WE GET TO THIS IOGA THE INFLUENCE OF SWEDISH DYMESTICS AND MONGOLYAN CONTORTIONISTS AND THE WESTERN THE WEST AFFECTING IT AND THEN THE ANCIENT PRACTICE WHICH WAS VERILY ASONA RELATED POSTURE POSITION SO ACTUALLY YOU SAID THE OGA IS LESSLY NEAR YOU GES VERY NEAR VERY IN YOUR THES DAYS THESE LINES LOOK AT ALL THE TRADITIONAL DENCES THEY LOOK LIKE NOTHING LIKE YEOGA LOOK AT TIDANCE LOOK AT CHINESE DENCES MARTIAL ARTS SO ROUND AT SALL CURLETS LIKE THE LIKE OUT NATURE WHAT YOU SEE NATURE AND THE MOVEMENT OF THE ANIMALS SO WHERE DOES IT COME FROM THESE ORS THINGS TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE IT DESIGNS YOU NOW IT SHAPES YOU YOU PLACING YOURSELF IN THIS FORCES OF CHANGE AND TE STREAMS OF CHANGE AND YOU HAVE A GOOD INTENTION AND YOU JUST WANT THIS OR THAT BUT THE JOKE IS ON US AND THIS IS THE MOVEMENT PRACTICE FOR ME IS FIRST EDUCATION START TO THINK ABOUT THIS I HAVE NOTHING THAT I CAN JUST PRINKLE NOW SOME MAGIC POWDER THAT WILL HELP RESOLVE THIS BECAUSE IT'S A START OF THE DEEP INVESTIGATION AND THEN O SOME OF THE THINGS PROGMA LET STOCK PROGMATICALLY BECAUSE WHAT YOU DESCRIBED IS NOT ABOUT YOU PLACING THE FOOT IN FRONT WHEN YOUR CURLING IT'S ABOUT THE EXAMINATION THIS IS WHIT IT IT IS A VERY GOOD DIRECTION AND THEN YOU WILL NEED ANOTHER ONE ANOTHER ONE DON'T GET STUCK ON THAT FOO IN FRONT OF AT AND TRY TO DO WITH THE EYE CLOSED OR WITH A DIFFERENT HAD POSTURE AND YOU WILL SEE THINGS ARRIVE UNRELATED THINGS BECAUSE THE ASSOCIATIVE MIND THE THINKING THIS RELATES THIS DOESN'T GET TO THE HEART OF IT NEVER SO JUST IN FUSING THIS ELEMENTS LIKE IN A CUP WILL CREATE ENDLESS COMBINATIONS POSSIBILITIES AND A LOT OF DISCOVERY AND THIS FOR MIS HUMILITY OF THE PRACTITIONER I DON'T KNOW I TRY LIKE TO DAY WITH YOU I TRIED VERIOUS COMBINATIONS AND OUGH I DISCOVER SOMETHING AL THIS THIS IS A PLAYFUL APPROACH AND THIS IS A RESEARCHER APPROACH AN I DON'T TRY TO FIT MY TRUTH INTO SOMETHING I THERE TO EXAMINE I DON'T HAVE A MOTIVE YET WHY BECAUSE I'M FINE I DON'T DEPEND ON THAT TO DEFIND MYSELF I 'M A HUMAN BEING BUT IF I DON'T HAVE THAT SENSE OF WORTH I I'M ALREADY LIKE GEAR TOWARDS I NEED TO DO THIS I NEED TO PROVE THIS I HAVE THIS AGENDER AND THIS IS HOW WE GET ALL THE LIES IN THE WORLD AND ALL THE THE PROBLEMS AND DIFFICULTIES SO THIS PRACTICES THEY ARE RELATED TO IT TO PROVE THIS THAT THIS WAY AND WHY WE NEED MUSCLES FOR EXUISE THAT AND A LOT OF THE I REPORTED OUTCOMES ARE OFTEN FROM MY PLACES LIKE FUNNY I HEAR ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE I I HEARD YOU SAY ABOUT GRATITUDE PRACTICE THAT E ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE FROM OUTSIDE S IF SOMEBODY ELSE OR YOU ARE RECEIVING GRAD TO THIS ACTUALLY MORE POWERFUL IT'S TRUE BUT I SEE WHITES YOU I I'M NOT SURE EVERYBODY SIS IF SOMEBODY TRIES TO FEEL GRATITUDE JUST SIT WITH THE EYES CLOSE OR WATCH A MOVI AND SENSS THE GRAD TO THERE IT WOULD BE CLEAR TO YOU ONE IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DO AND THE OTHERS VERY EASY HENCE IF GRADITUDE HIS ACHIEVED EASIER THIS WAY THAT'S WHY IT WORKS LIKE THAT ALTHOUGH ALL THE TRADITIONAL PRACTICES ARE ABOUT YOU AND BY CHALLENGING YOURSELF TO SENSE THAT GRATITUDE YOURSELF THE ACHIEVE MUCH MORE POWVER THING BUT THIS IS NOT THE RESEARCH PEOPLE ETE THE PEOPLE IN THE RESEARCH WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE SO A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT AR CAN ARRIVE TO US WAY TRAINING THE BENEFITS AOR THE WAY THAT THE THE HORMONAL EFFECTS AND THE EFFECT OVER COGNITION AND ET CETERA I WHEN YOU OPEN A BIT AND YOU GRO FAR OUT YOU SEE CERTAIN THINGS NOT THE TRUTH BUT MAY BE LESS DELUSION YOU THERE IS NOT NOTHING DEFINITE BUT THERE IS THERE IS SOMETHING MAY BE MORE WHOLESOME THAT APPEARS AM YE I THINK THIS IS SO TH THIS IS A STATE STATE OF EXPLORATION I DON'T WANT TO HAVE THE SAME THOUGHT IF I ALREADY HAD IT HY WOULD I WANT TO HAVE THE SAME THOUGHT I ALREADY HAD IT I DON'T WANT TO HAVE THE SAME PRACTICE I DO WANT IT I CURLED ALREADY IN THIS WAY I WANT TO EXPERIENCE SOMETHING ELSE I WANT TO THERE IS A BENEFIT TO GAIN NO BUT THAT WAS BETTER THE BETTER IS ETTER IS IS NOT MORE IS NOT FASTER IS A BETTER IS BETTER AND BETTER IS I WE DON'T KNOW WHAT BETTER IS FRIGHTS OIS LIE IT'S OPEN OH THIS IS BETTER I DON'T KNOW IT'S JUST MORE WAIGHT IT'S ONE MORKILO BUT MAYBE IF I REMOVE ONE KILO I DISCOVER SOMETHING LIKE FOR EXAMPLE POWER DEVELOPMENT THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN ITO PAIN CERTAIN BENEFITS WHEN YOU LIGHTEN THE LOAD AND YOU ACCELERATE IT MORE IN CERTAIN CONDITIONS BUT WHO DISCOVERED IT A PRACTITIONER AND MET PERSON  NOT VER KOSHENSKI IS OT SIORSKI THEY REPORTED SOMETHING BUT IT WAS ALREADY WITHIN THE GRASP OF THE PRACTITIONERS I THINK AM AN ASER AS A RESEARCHER THIS IS VERY POWERFUL TO REMIND YOURSELF THIS AND TO WORK WITH THAT AND AS A PRACTITIONER AS A LEAVING HUMAN BEING FOR EVERYONE I THINK SOMETHING VERY USEFUL AND THAN THOSE PLAS THAT YOUR DOING IT E PEOPLE GIVE YOU THIS THE WEIRD LOOKS ANDS LIKE YE I TELL PEOPLE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE NORMAL IF YOU DON'T GET THE WOIRD LOOKS YOU'RE NOT MOVING IN THE HRI DERECT YOURE MOVING IM AND IN A VERY FIXED AND  YOU ALREADY KNOW THE RESULT OF THAT DIRECTION LET' SAY AT LEAST THAT SO CONTINUE TO PLAY WASH THAT T CONTINUE TO PLAY LOOK ELSEWHERE LOOK AT PLACES YOU DIDN'T LOOK YET BECAUSE THIS IS STILL LIKE WITHIN THE SAME LAYER ONE FOOT IN FRONT OF  ONE FOOT BEHIND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DO IT WITH A SMILE THE SAME WORK OUT AND WHEN YOU DO IT WIS A FROWN OR WHAT HAPPENS BREAST HOLDING OR BLODERESTRICT AS ALL THIS I'S GREAT PLAY AND I THINK A VERY BENEFICIAL TO DO TO GO THOUGH THA I THINK HAT SO WONDERFUL MESSAGE WHAT I KEEP HERING FROM YO OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS TO THAT PEOPLE SHOULD EXPLORE EXPLORE EXPLORE AND DAM THE S AND I I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TO DAY FIRST OF ALL AM FOR THE INCREDIBLE TEACHINGS HERE AT THE TABLE BUT ALSO THE INTRODUCTION TO A MOVEMENT PRACTICE THOUGH NOW I'M TEMPTED TO SAY THAT I'VE BEEN MOVING MY WHOLE LIFE I'VE JUST THAT ISYU KNOW I WAS THAT IT WAS SUCH A VAST LANDSCAPE AM THAT ALSO THYOU'RE WILLINGNESS TO TREAD OUT IN THIS I JOURNEY THAT IS TRULY UNIQUE YOU KNOW THAT THE GREATEST COMPLIMENT THAT ONE CAN GIVE IN SCIENCE IS THE ONE HAT EMINENT TELL YOU NOW BECAUSE IT'S ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE WHICH IS WE SAY YOU'RE AN END OF ONE RIGHT THAT THAT AND YOU TRULY ARE I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY ONE THAT HAS BEEN AS WILLING TO EMBRACE EXISTING PRACTICES EVOLVE THE CREATE NEW PRACTICES AND AND IM AND TO SHARE SO BROADLY TO REALLY BE WILLING TO GIVEEN TEACH SO MUCH KNOWLEDGE YOURE EARLIER YOU MADE THE MENTION OF YOUR EURGOALS OF AHIN PART OF

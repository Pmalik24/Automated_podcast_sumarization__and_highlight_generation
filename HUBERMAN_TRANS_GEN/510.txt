WELCOME TO THE HUBERMANLAPODCANS THE A SCIENCE  SCIENCE SPACE TO  FI M INDRHUBERMEN AND I'M A PROFESSOR OF NEUROBOLOGY AN OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF

EDICTION IN FACT DURING OUR DISCUSSION I LEARNED THAT THERE ARE A HUGE RANGE OF BEHAVIORS AND SUBSTANCES TO WHICH PEOPLE CAN BECOME EDCTED TO AND THAT THERE IS A COMMON BIOLOGICAL UNDER PINNING OF ALL THOSE EDICTIONS I ALSO LEARNED THAT THERE IS A COMMON PATH TO THE TREATMENT AND RECOVERY FROM ESSENTIALLY ALL EDICTIONS DOCTOR LEMPKE EXPLAINED THAT TO ME AND EXPLAINED HOW TO THINK ABOUT AND CONCEPTIALIZE OUR OWN EDICTIONS AS WELL AS THE EDICTIONS OF OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO GECTREATMENT MOVE THROUGH TREATMENT AND STAYE SOBER FROM THEIR EDICTIONS IN ADDITION TO TREATING PATIENCE

DOCTOR ANNA LEMPKY ARE I GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE THANK YE FOR HAVING TE AN EXCITED TO BE HERE ND I HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU I I AND MANY LISTENERS OF THIS PODCAST ARE OBSESSED WITH DOPOMIN AND WHAT IS DOPOMIN HOW DOES IT WORK WE ALL HEAR THAT DOPOMINE IS THE SMALL ACULE ASSOCIATE WITH PLEASURE I THINK THE A THE TERM DOPOMIN HITS LIKE A GETTING A DOPOMI HIT FROM THIS FROM INSTEGRAM OR FROM LIKES OR FROM PRASE OR FROM WHATEVER IS NOW OM COMMONLY HEARD WHAT IS DOPOMIN AND WHATER MAYBE SOME THINGS ABOUT DOPOMI THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW AND PROBABLY THAT I DON'T KN OW EITHER SO DOPEMING IS A NARROW TRANSMITTER AND NARROW TRANSMITTERS ARE THOSE MOLECULES THAT BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN TO NURNS SO THE ESSENTIALLY ALLOW WONDER ON THE PRESONAPTIC NERON TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE POSTSONAPTIC NERON A DOPEMING IS INTIMATELY A ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXPERIENCE OF REWARD BUT ALSO WITH MOVEMENT WHICH I THINK IS REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE MOVEMENT AND REWARD AR LINKED RIGHT IF YOU THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW A EARLY HUMANS YOU HAD TO MOVE IN ORDER TO GO SEEK OUT THE WATER OR THE THE MEAT OR WHATEVER IT WAS A AND EVEN IN THE MOST PRIMITIVE ORGANISMS DOPENING IS RELEASED WHEN FOOD IS SENSED IN THE ENVIRONMENT FOR EXAMPLE SEE ELEGANS A BIT A VERY APRIMITIVE WORM SO A DOPEMING IS THIS REALLY A POWERFUL IMPORTANCE MOLECULE IN THE BRAIN THAT HELPS US A EXPERIENCE PLEASURE IT'S NOT THE ONLY NARROW TRANSMITTER INVOLVED IN PLEASURE BUT IT'S A REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT ONE AND IF IF YOU WANT A THINK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW ABOUT DOPENING WHICH WHICH I THINK IS REALLY INTERESTING IS THAT WE WE ARE ALWAYS RELEASING DOPEMING AT A KIND OF TONIC BASE LINE RATE AND IT'S REALLY THE DEVIATION FROM THAT BASE LINE RATHER THAN LIKE HITS OF DOPENING IN A VACUM THAT MAKE A DIFFERENCE SO WHEN WE EXPERIENCE PLEASURE OUR DOPEMING RELEASE GOES ABOVE BASE LINE AND LIKEWISE DOPNING CAN GO BELOW THAT TONIC BASE LINE AND THEN WE EXPERIENCE OF KIND OF PAIN INTERESTING SO IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT ONE'S BASE LINE LEVELS OF DOPEING HOW FREQUENTLY WERE AR RELEASING DOPEMING IN THE ABSENCE OF SOME AOO DROG OR FOOD OR EXPERIENCE JUST SITTING BEING IS THAT A SOCIET WITH HOW HAPPY SOMEBODY IS TA KOND OF BASE LINE OF HAPPINESS WERE LEVEL OF DEPRESSION THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT SHOWS THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE DEPRESSED MAY INDEED HAVE LOWER TONIC LEVELS OF DOPENING SO THAT'S A REALLY REASONABLE THOUGHT AND THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THAT MAY BE TRUE THE OTHER THING THAT WE KNOW AND THIS IS IN A REALLY KIND OF WHAT WHAT THE BOOK IS ABOUT IS THAT IF WE AM EXPOSE OURSELVES CHRONICALLY TO SUBSTANCES OR BEHAVIOURS THAT REPEATEDLY RELEASE LARGE AMOUNTS OF DOPENING IN OUR BRAINS REWARD PATHWAY THAT WE CAN CHANGE OUR TONIC BASE LINE AND ACTUALLY LOWER IT OVER TIME AS OUR BRAIN TRIES TO COMPENSATE FOR ALL OF THAT DOPENING WHICH IS MORE REALLY THAN WE WERE DESIGNS TO TO EXPERIENCE INTERESTING IN IS WHD IS IT AM THE CASE THAT OUR BASELINE LEVELS OF DOPEING ARE SET BY OUR GENATICS BY A HEREDITY WELL I THINK YOU KNOW IF YOU THINK ABOUT SORT OF  KNOR THE EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPM AN INFANCY CERTAINLY THAT IS TRUE YOUR KIND OF YOU KNOW BORN WITH PROBABLY WHATEVER IS YOUR BASE LINE LEVEL BUT OBVIOUSLY YOUR EXPERIENCES CAN HAVE A HUGE IMPACT UM WHERE YOURE YOUR DOPENING LEVEL ULTIMATELY SETTLES OUT SO UM IF SOMEBODY'S DISPOSITION IS ONE OF U CONSTANT EXCITEMENT AND ANTICIPATION OR EASILY EXCITED I ET THESE A I THINK ABOUT THE KIND OF PEOPLE YOU SAY YOU WANT TO CHECK OUT THIS NEW PLACE FOR TALKAS AND I CAN THET BE GREAT AND OTHER PEOPLE ARE AM A LO MORE CYNICAL IDER A MUDGE LIKE MY BOLL DON COSTELLO UM THE VERY VERY STABLE LOW LEVELS OF DOBEING WITH BIG INFLECTIONS IN HIS CASE U IS THAT DO YOU THINK THATS A SAT IN TERMS OF UM OUR PARENTS AND OBVIOUSLY NATURE INNURTURE INTERACT BUT IS THAT IS DOPE MEAN THAT THE COURPE OF OUR TEMPERAMENT I DON'T REALLY THINK WE KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT BUT I WILL SAY THAT PEOPLE ARE DEFINITELY BORN WITH DIFFERENT TEMPERAMENTS AND THOSE TEMPERAMENTS DO EFFECTS THERE ABILITY TO EXPERIENCE JOY UM AND AND YOU KNOW WE'VE KNOWN THAT FOR A LONG TIME AND WE DESCRIBE THAT IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE DESCRIBE THAT IN THE MODERN ARA IS TO USE PSYCHIATRIC KNOWINCLATURE LIKE THIS PERSON HAS A DYSCHIMIC TEMPERAMENT OR IT OF THIS PERSON HAS CHRONIC MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER UM IN TERMS OF LOOKING SPECIFICALLY AT WHOSE VLNERABLE TO ADDICTION UM THAT'S AN INTERESTING SORT OF MIXED O BAG BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK IT ON THE RESEARCH ON RISFACTORESS FOR ADICTION SO WHAT KIND OF TEMPERAMENT AOF A PERSON MAKES THEM MORE VULNERABLE TO ADDICTION YOU SEE A INTERESTING FINDINGS FIRST YOU SEE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE IMPULSIVE ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO ADDICTION SO WHAT IS IMPULSIVITY THAT MEANS HAVING DIFFICULTY AM PUTTING SPACE BETWEEN THE THOUGHT OR DESIRE TO DO SOMETHING AN ACTUALLY DOING IT AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIFFICULTY PUTTING A SPACE THERE WHOAR WHO HAVE A THOUGHT TO DO SOMETHING AND JUST DO IT IMPULSIVELY OUR PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO ADDICTION INTERESTING COULD A IN TERMS OF IMPULSIVITY IS A SOMETHING THAT RELATES LITERALLY TO UM THE STARTLE REFLECTS LIKE I FOR INSTANCE HAS A A LABDERACTER I'M FAMILIAR WITH WALKING ROUND MY LAB AND UM WHEN I DECIDE DECIDING OON TO TALK TO MY PEOPLE COURSE WHEN THEY KNOCK ON MY DOOR IT'S ALWAYS LIKE WAIT WHY MI BEG BOTHER RIGHT NOW YOUVEN O I LOVE TO TO THEM BUT I WALK AROUND MY LAD FROM TIME TO TIME AND SOME PEOPLE I KNOWAS I'LL SAY UM DO YOU HAVE A MOMENT AND THEY'LL SLOLLY TURN ROUND AND SAY OR NO SOMETHING S UM AND OTHER PEOPLE WILL JUMP THE MOMENT I SAY THEIR NAME THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A A KIND OF A HEIGHTENED A STARTLE REFLECTIS THAT RELATED TO IMPULSIVITY OR IS WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO UM AN ATTEMPT TO A WITH WHOLD BEHAVIOUR THAT'S VERY DELIBERATE ANDER VERY DELIBERATE CONDITION YET SO I DON'T THINK THAT THAT STARTLE REFLEC IS IS NECESSARILY RELATED TO IMPULSIVITY THAT THAT CAN BE RELATED TO ANXIETIES OF PEOPLE WHO ARE HIGH ANXIETY PEOPLE WILL TEND TO HAVE MORE OF A STARTLE REFLECTS IMPULSIVITY IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT AND BY THE WAY IMPULSIVITY IS NOT ALWAYS BAD RIGHT AM IMPULSIVITY IS IS THAT THING WARE THERE'S NOT A LOT OFSELF AD ITING OR WORRYING ABOUT FUTURE CONSEQUENCES YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE IDEA TO DO SOMETHING AND YOU DO IT AND OF COURSE WE CAN IMAGIN MANY CENARIOS WERE THAT'S ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL UM YOU KNOW THERE CAN BE A SORT OF A LET'S SAY IN AMIT AM INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PEOPLE WHERE YOU WOULDN'T REALLY WANT TO BE SUPERHIBITED ABOUT IT RIGHT YOU WOULD WANT TO BE DISINHIBITED AND AND IMPULSIVE OM THERE I CAN ALSO LIKE IMAGINE LIKE SORT OF UM FIGHTER FLIGHT CENAREOS LIKE BATTLE CENARIOS RIGHT WHERE WHERE IT WOULD REALLY BE GOOD TO BE IMPULSIVE AND JUST R NO WHO DO WHRE HA TATION CAN CALLS WHEN I AT YES THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT BUT YOU KNOW AND I THINK THIS IT BRINGS UP A REALLY WAINSTNNG THAT I'VE COME TO BELIEVE THAT AFTER TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF PRACTISING PSYCHIATRY IS THAT WHAT WE NOW CONCEPTIALIZE IN OUR CURRENT ECOSYSTEM AS MENTAL ILLNESS ARE ACTUALLY TRAITS THAT IN ANOTHER ECOSYSTEM MIGHT BE VERY ADVANTAGEOUS THERE JUST NOT ADVANTAGEOUS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF THE WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN AND AND I THINK OU KNOW IMPULSIVITY IS POTENTIALLY ONE OF THOSE RIGHT CAUSE WE LIVE IN THIS WORLD THAT SORT OF LIKE YOU HAVE TO UM CONSTANTLY BE THINKING SORT OF RATIONALLY ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF EXUIRE E AND IN SUCH A SENSORY RICH ENVIRONMENT RIGHT THAT WE'RE COBEING BOMBARDED WITH ALL THESE OPPORTUNITIES TE SENSORY OPPORTUNITIES AND WE HAVE TO CONSTANTLY CHECK OURSELVES AND SO SO SO IMPULSIVITY IS SOMETHING THAT RIGHT NOW AM CAN BE A DIFFICULT TRAHT BUT ISN'T IN IT OF ITSELF A BAD THING I SYAN IT'S IA BEGIN O REALIZES THE FINE LINE BETWEEN SPONTANEITY AND IMPULSIVITY A WHAT IS PLEASURE AND HOW DOES IT WORK AT THE BIOLOGICAL LEVEL AND UM IF IF IT FEELS RIGHT AT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL LEVEL I THINK WE AND UM IF YOU DON'T MIND A PAINTING A PICTURE OF THE THE RANGE OF THINGS THAT YOU HAVE OBSERVED IN YOUR CLENIC OR IN LIFE THAT PEOPLE CAN BE COME EDICTED TO BUT JUST TO START OFF REALY SIMPLY WHAT IS THIS THING THAT WE CALL PLEASURE WHY THINK IT'S IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY HARD TO DEFINE PLEASURE IN ANY KIND OF SUSINCT WAY BECAUSE CERTAINLY THERE IS THE SEEKING OUT OF A A AHIGH OR A UFORIA OR OR I THINKS YOU KNOW THE KIND OF EXPERIENCE THAT MOST ANYBODY WOULD ASSOCIATE WITH THE WORD PLEASURE BUT BUT ALL SO AM THE SEEKING OUT OF THOSE SAME SUBSTANCES AND BEHAVIORS IS OFTEN AWAY TO ESCAPE THE PAIN SO FOR EXAMPLE WHEN I WHEN I TALK TO PEOPLE WITH EDDICTION UM SOMETIMES THEY'RE INITIAL FOR A INTO USING A DRUG IS TO GET PLEASURE BUT VERY OFTEN ITS AWAY TO ESCAPE THEIR SUFFERING WHATEVER THEIR SUFFERING MAY BE AND CERTAINLY AS PEOPLE BE COMADDICTED EVEN THOSE WHO INITIALLY WERE SEEKING OUT PLEASURE ARE ULTIMATELY JUST TRYING TO AVOID THE PAIN OF WITHDRAWAL ORE THE PAIN OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR DRUG EYS SO I I THINK IT'S YOU KNOW VERY HARD TO ACTIALLY YOU KNOW DEFIND IT AS THIS UNITARY THING IN ITS CERTAINLY NOT JUST GETTING AHIGH THERE ARE SO MANY WAYS IN WHICH PEOPLE SORT OF WANT TO ESCAPE WHICH IS NOT THE SAME THING AS THROUG THIS HEDONIC WE NO WANTING TO FEEL PLEASURE SO SOME ONE COULD DECIDE THAT THEY WANT TO GO OUT AND DANCE OR GET UP AND DANCE BECAUSE OF THE PLEASURE OF DANCING I CAN IMAGINE THAT UM BUT A AND MAYBE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO STACE SEETED WHEN A PARTICULAR SONG COMES ON FOR INSTANCE BUT AM SEEKING WHAT WE WOULD CALL PLEASURE IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE PAIN THAT VOKES A DIFFERENT PICTURE IN MY MIND THAT EVOKES A PICTURE OF SOMEBODY THAT U FEELS LOST OR DEPRESSED OR UNDERWHELMED UM I DIFFULLY WANT TO GET INTO THE PRECISE AND GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF A DICTION IN WHAT THAT IS BUT IN A PREVIOUS CONVERSATION WE HAD YOU SAID SOMETHING THAT REALLY WRUNG IN MY MIND WHICH IS THAT MANY PEOPLE WHO BECOME ADDICTED TO THINGS CLEMATICS UM HAVE THIS FEELING THAT NORMAL LIFE ISN'T INTERESTING ENOUGH THAT THEY ARE SEEKING A SUPERNORMAL EXPERIENCE AND THAT THE DATA DAY ROUTINE AM BALANCE WHICH IS ACTUALLY IN THE TITLE OF YOUR BOOK A DOPEMING NATION FINDING BALANCE IN THE AGE OF INDULGENCE THAT THE WORD BALANCE ITSELF CAN SOMETIMES BE A BIT OF THE A ANAVERSIVE M AND UM I I'M STRUCK BY THIS IDEA AND THE REASON I WANT TO EXPLORE IT IS BECAUSE SO MUCH OF WHAT I SEE ON LINE IS ABOUT GENERATING A LACK OF BALANCE ABOUT BEING TILTED FORWARD AT ALL TIMES REALLY LEANING INTO LIFE HARD EXPERIENCING LIFE OU A LIVING A FULL LIFE A EVEN THE COMMENCEMENT SPEECH GIVEN BY STEVE JOBS ON THIS CAMPUS WAS REALLY ABOUT FINDING PASSION DIGGING IN THAT' SO MUCH IN THE NARRATIVE NOW UM SO MAYB YOU COULD JUST TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH THIS A SASSOCIATION IF IT REALLY EXISTS BETWEEN A PEOPLE'S SENSE OF THE NORMAL SEE OR MAYBEVEN HOW BORING LIFE CAN BE AND THEIR TENDENCY TO BECOME ATTICS OF SOME SORT YA WELL I MEAN I I THINK THAT LIFE FOR HUMANS HAS ALWAYS BEEN HARD BUT I THINK THAT NOW IT'S HARDER IN UNPRECEDENTED WAYS AND I THINK THAT THE WAY THAT LIFE IS IS REALLY HARD NOW IS THAT IT ACTUALLY IS REALLY BORING M AND THE REASON THAT IT'S BORING IS BECAUSE ALL OF OUR SURVIVAL NEEDS ARE MET RIGHT I MEAN WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO LEAVE OUR HOMES TO MEET EVERY SINGLE PHYSICAL NEED OU KNOWS LONG AS SURE OF A CERTAIN LEVEL OF FINANCIAL WELL BEING WHICH WAS FRANKLY IM YOUKNOW THAT WE TALK SO MUCH ABOUT IN THE THE INCOME GAP AND CERTAINLY THERE IS THIS ENORMOUS GAP BETWEEN WHICH AND POOR BUT THAT GAP IS SMALLER THAN IT'S EVER BEEN LIKE THE HISTORY OF HUMANS AM EVEN THE POOREST OF THE POOR HAVE MORE A EXESS INCOME TO SPEND ON LEISURE GOODS THAN THEY EVER HAVE BEFORE IN HUMAN HISTORY IM IF YOU LOOK IT LEISURE TIME FOR EXAMPLE SO PEOPLE WITHOUT A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION HAVE FORTY TWO PER CENT MORE LEISURE TIME THAN PEOPLE WITH AM A COLLEGE DEGREE AM SO SO MIHE MY POINT HERE IS THAT LIFE IS HARD NOW IN THIS REALLY WEIRD WAY IN THAT WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING THAT WE HAVE TO DO SO WE'RE ALL FORCED TO MAKE STUFF UP YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S BEING A SCIENTIST OR BEING A DOCTER OR BEING AN OLYMPIC ATHLY OR YOU KNOW CLIMBING MOUNT EVEREST AND PEOPLE REALLY VERY IN THEIR NEED FOR FRICTION AND SOME PEOPLE NEED A LOT MORE THAN OTHERS AND IF THEY DON'T HAVE IT THE'RE REALLY REALLY UNHAPPY AND I DO THINK THAT A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT I SEE WITH ADICTION AND OTHER FORMS OF MENTAL ILLNESS OUR PEOPLE WHO NEED MORE FRICTION LIKE THERE UNHAPPY NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THEIR BRAIN BUT BECAUSE THEIR BRAIN IS NOT SUITED TO THIS WORLD AND DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE THAT SENSE MY BRAIN ISN'T SUITED TO THIS WORLD OR THEY SIMPLY FEEL AM A RESTLESSNESS AND THEIR CONSTANTLY SEEKING STIMULATION I THINK THAT'S RIGHT YE I THINK IT'S IT'S NOT REALLY KNOWING WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME AM WHY AM I UNHAPPY MHOW CAN I BE HAPPIER AND OF COURSE IS YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT WHAT'S SO PERVASIVE IN OUR NARRATIVE NOW IS LIKE FINDER PASSION YOU KNOW AM MENO FINDER YUT WHATEVER IT IS TO SAVE THE WORLD AND IN A WAY THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE IT HAS PEOPLE OUT IN THE WORLD THAN SEEKING AM BUT BUT IN A WAY IT CAN ALSO BE MISLEADING IN THE SENSE THAT IM I THINK PEOPLE AREN'T ENTIRELY AWARE THAT THAT THE WORLD IS A HARD PLACE AND THAT THAT LIFE IS HARD AND THAT YOU KNOW LIKE WE'RE ALL KIND OF MAKING IT UP DOU KNOWT I MNOWHER'S I TEL NEWPORT IN IF YOU KNOW CALLNUPORT'S WORK BUT AT YOUES IR IM VERY SINBIOTIC IN YOUR MESSAGES BIT I HE'S A PROFESSOR OF COMPETER SCIENCE AT AT GEORGETOWN AT YES AT GEORGETOWN AND WROTE A BOOK SOME YEARS AGO REALLY AHAD OF ITS TIME CALLED SO GOOD THEY CAN'T IGNORE YOU WHICH IS ABOUT NOT IM MEDITATING OR A DOING MUCH WORK TO TRYIN FIGUR OUT WHAT ONCES PASSION IS BY THINKING BUT RATHER GO OUT AND ACQUIRE SKILLS RIGHT AND GET DEVELOP A SENSE OF OF PASSION FOR SOMETHING BY YOUR EXPERIENCE OF HARD WORK AND AND GETTING BETTER AND FMAI LOLIT TO THE GROWTH MINE TAT THE MAR COLLY CARROLS WECK BUT HE'S GONE ON TO WRITE BOOKS IM DEEP WORK AND  WHICH IS ALL ABOUT REMOVING YOURSELF FROM TECNOLOGY IN DOING DEEP WOTH AND HE'S AP IN A BIG PROPONENT OF THE EVILS OF CONTECT SWITCHING TOO OFTEN THROUGHOUT THE DAY FOR SAKE OF PRODUCTIVITY MOSTLY HIS NEW BOOK IS CALLED 'M A WORLD WITHOUT EMAL IGANY REALIZES I SIDE OFF THESE BOOKS AND YOUR BOOK DOPEI NATION A FINDING BALANCE IN THE AGE OF INDULGENCE THAT A MAYBE OF THE REASON WHY YOU TWO DON'T KNOW ABOUT ONE ANOTHER IS BECAUSE NEITHER OF YOU ARE ON SOCIAL WE AD  ET RIGHT ANTO OF THE MOST PRODUC IF PEOPLE TIT I KNOW I'M INCLUDING PRODUCTIVE AUTHOR SO THAT'S A DISCUSSION INTO ITSELF BUT I FIND THIS FASCINATING SO IM LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PLEASURE PAIN BALANCE AND A DICTION AN OFFER TO USE THIS A SESAW OR BALANCE KALLI IM ANALOGY BEFORE AND I THINK IT'S A WONDERFUL ONE A THAT REALLY FOR ME CLARIFIED WHAT A DICTION IS AT LEAST AT THE MECHANISTIC LOVEL YES BUT TO ME ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS IN NARROW SCIENCE IN LAST SEVENTY FIVE YEARS IS THAT PLEASURE AND PAIN AR COLOCATED WHICH MEANS THE SAME PARTS OF THE BRAIN THAT PROCESS PLEASURE ALSO PROCESS PAIN AND THEY WORK LIKE A BALANCE SO WHEN WE FEEL PLEASURE OR BALANCE TIPS ONE WAY WHEN WE FEEL PAIN AT TIPS IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND ONE OF THE OVERWRITING RULES GOVERNING THIS BALANCE IS THAT IT WANTS TO STAY LEVEL SO IT DOES N'T WANT TO REMAIN TIPPED VERY LONG TO PLEASURE OR TO PAIN AND WITH ANY DEVIATION FROM NEUTRALITY THE BRAIN WILL WORK VERY HARD TO RESTORE A LEVEL BALANCE OR WHAT SCIENTISTS CALL HOMEAS STASTIS AND THE WAY THE BRAIN DOES THAT IS WITH ANY STIMULUS TO ONE SIDE THERE WILL BE A TIP IN EQUAL AND OPPOSITE AMOUNT TO THE OTHER SIDE TO GIVE PRINCIPAL LAWS OF PHYSICS YES RIGHTS RIGHT SO LIKE I LIKE TO WATCH YOU TWO VIDIOS WHEN I WANCH YOU TO VIDOS OF AMERICAN IGHT ALL YOU KNOW IT TIPS THE SIDE OF PLEASURE AND THAND WHEN I STOP WATCHING IT I'M I HAVE COME DOWNRIGHT WHICH IS AT TIP TO THE EQUAL IN OPPOSITE AMOUNT IM ON THE OTHER SIDE AND THAT'S THAT MOMENT OF WANTING TO WATCH ONE MORE YOU TO VIDIO RIHT YE AND I WI JUST WANT IT IUM DRIJECT THERE SO THIS MOMENT OF OF WANTING TO WATCH ANOTHER THAT IS ASSOCIATE WITH PAIN I THINK IS ARE WE ALWAYS AWARE OF THAT HAPPENING CAUSE YOU JUST DESCRIBED IN A VERY CONSCIEUSE WEREIGHTS BUT WHEN I I'M INDULGE IN SOMETHING I ENJOY I'M USUALLY THINKING ABOUT JUST WANTING MORE YES THIN ON'T THINK ABOUT THE PAIN I  YA ABOUT MORE RIGHT SO REALLY EXCELLENT POINT BECAUSE WE'RE MOSTLY NOT AWARE OF IT AND IT'S ALSO REFLECTS IVE SO WE EATS NOT SOMETHING THAT CONSCIOUSLY HAPPENS OR THAT WE'RE AWARE OF UNLESS WE REALLY BEGIN TO PAY ATTENTION AND AND WHEN WE BEGIN TO PAY ATTENTION WE REALLY CAN BECOME VERY AWARE OF IT IN THE MOMENT AGAIN IT'S LIKE A FALLING AWAY LIKE THAT WON'T YOUNOUR YOURE ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND YOU KNOW YOU GET A GOOD TWEET OF SOMETHING AND THEN YOU CAN'T STOP YOURSELF BECAUSE THERE'S THIS A WARENESS A LATENTA WARENESS THAT AS SOON AS I DISENGAGE FROM THIS BEHAVIOR I'M GOING TO EXPERIENCE A A KIND OF A PAIN RIGHT OF FALLING AWAY AMISSING THAT FEELING A WANTING MORE OF IT AND OF COURSE ONE WAY TO COMBAT THAT IS TO DO IT MORE RIGHT AND MORE AND MORE AND MORE SO I THINK I THINK THAT IS REALLY WHAT I WANT PEOPLE TO TUNE INTO AND AND GET IN A WARENESS AROUND BECAUSE ONCE YOU TUN INTO IT YOU CAN SEE IT ALOT AND WHEN YOU BEGIN TO SEE IT YOU HAVE AND IF YOU YOU KEEP THE MODEL OF THE BALANCE IN MINE I THINK IT IT GIVES PEOPLE KIND OF A WAY TO IMAGIN WHAT THERE EXPERIENCING ON A NAURO BIOLOGICAL OF ONE UNDERSTAND IT AND IN THAT UNDERSTANDING GET SOME MASTERY OVER IT WHICH IS REALLY WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT BECAUSE ULTIMATELY WE DO NEED TO DISENGAGE RIGHT WE CAN'T LIVE IN THAT SPACE ALL THE TIME WHERE WE HAVE OTHER THINGS WE NEED TO DO AND THERE ARE ALSO SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES THAT COME WITH TRYING TO REPEAT AND CONTINUE THAT EXPERIENCE OUG THAT FEELING A SO F I UNDERSTAND THIS CORRECTLY AND WHEN WE FIND SOMETHING ER WHEN SOMETHING FINDS ON THAT WE ENJOY THAT FEELS PLEASUREFUL ON SOCIAL MEDIA OF FOO RIHT SEX GAMBLING WHATEVER HAPPENS TO BE WE WILL EXPLORE THE FUL RANGE THESE THERE SAY SOME DOPEMEIN RELEASE WHEN WE ENGAGE IN THAT BEAND THEN WHAT YOUR TELLING IS THAT VERY QUICKLY YES AND BENEATH MY CONSCIEUSE AWARSN THERE'S A TILTING BACK OF THIS SCALE WHERE PLEASURE IS REDUCED BY WAY OF INCREASING PAIN RIGHT AND I'VE HEARD YOU SAY BEFORE THAT THE PAIN MECHANISM HAS SOME COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IS OVER THE PLEASURE MECHANISM SUCH THAT IT DOESN'T JUST BRING THE SCALE BACK TO LEVEL IT ACTUALLY BRINGS PAIN HIGHER THAN PLEASURE COUND YOU TELL SOLLABIT MORE ABOUT THAT YET YET SO SO WHAT HAPPENS GAIN SO THAT E THE HALMARK OF ANY ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCE OR BEHAVIOUR IS THAT IT RELEASES A LOT OF DOPAMINE IN OUR BRANS REWARD PATHWAY LIKE RIGHT LIKE BROCKLY JUST DOESN'T RELEASE A LOT OF DOPEMY JUST DOESN'T RIGHT I DI NO NO NO  AB SINGNO I NT AN I N I  STOT IS  CAUSE NO BRUT BROCHLEY'S GOOD IT CAN BEAALY T BUT OCKLY IS NEVER AMAZE RIGHT ROTLE'S NEVER NEVERLIS AS ANITIGSN HONESTLY WE CAN PROBABLY FIND SOMEBODY ON THE PLAN AT NAON BROCKLEY IS MASY AND OF COURSE IF I'M STARVING BROCHLING BROCHLEY ISN'T MENOTHING RICH RAL RICH RALLAS BIG ON AR AND HE AND HE HAS A GOOD ANELATIONSHIP TO PLANTS ICH I TELL US HA I MANG A ROCKLEY AN AZING IF ANYONE CAN DO IT ANY RA  M BUT BUT WHAT HAPPENS BRIGHT AFTER I DO SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY PLEASURABLE AND RELEASESILL I DO'T MEAN IS AGAIN MY BRAIN IS GOING TO IMMEDIATELY COMPENSATE BY DOWN REGULATING MY OWN DOPEING RECEPTERS MY OWN DOPE MEAN TRANSMISSION TO COMPENSATE FOR THAT OQUE AND THAT'S THAT COME DOWN OR THE HANG OVER THAT AFTER EFFECT THAT MOMENT OF WANTED DO IT MORE NOW IF I JUST WAIT FOR THAT FEELING TO PASS THEN MY DOPE MEAN WILL REREGULATE ITSELF AND ALGO BACK TO WHATEVER MY CHRONIC BASE LINE IS BUT IF I DON'T WAIT AND HERE'S REALLY THE KEY IF I KEEP INDULGING AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN ULTIMATELY I HAVE I HAVE SO MUCH ON THE PAINSIDE RIGHT THAT I'VE ESSENTIALLY RESET MY BRAIN TO WHAT WE CALL LIKE AN ANHEDONIC OR LACKING IN JOY TYPE OF STATE WHICH IS A DOPEMEAN DEFICITE STATES SO THAT'S REALLY THE THE THAT THE WAY IN WHICH PAIN CAN BECOME THE MAIN DRIVER IS BECAUSE I'VE INDULGED SO MUCH IN THESE HIGHREWARD BEHAVIORS OR SUBSTANCES THAT MY BRAIN HAS HAD TO COMPENSATE BY WAY DOWN REGULATING MY OWN DOPEA MEAN SUCH THAT EVEN WHEN I'M NOT DOING THAT DRUG I'M IN ADOPENMING DEFOS IT STATE WHICH IS AKIN TO A CLINICAL DEPRESSION ISS ANXIETY IRRITABILITY AN SOMME DISPLORIA AND A LOT OF MENTAL PREOCCUPATION WITH USING AGAIN OR GETTING THE DRUG AND S THAT THAT'S THE PIECE THERE THERE'S THE SINGLE USE WHICH EASILY PASSES BUT IT'S THE CHRONIC USE THAT CAN THEN RESET REALLY AR DOPEMAN THRESHOLDS AND THEN NOTHING IS ENJOYABLE RIGHT THAT THEN EVERYTHING A SORT OF PALES IN COMPARISON TO THIS ONE DRUG THAT I WANT TO KEEP DOING AND THAT ONE DRUG COULD BE A PERSON IGHT I MEAN I YES I KNOW PEOPLE IN MY LIFE THAT ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT THIS ONE RELATIONSHIP THIS ONE PERSON THAT WAS JUST SO GREAT DESPITE ALL THE CHALLENGES OF THAT THING THAT I'S ALMOST LIKE THERE ADDICTED TO THE NARRATIVE HA O THER WORD MAYBE YOUR STILL ARE ADDICTED TO THE PERSON SC IT CAN BE TO ANY NUMBER OF THINGS VEDIO GAMESECTS A HAMBLING A PERSON A NARRATIVE TO ME AND BECAUSE OF THE WAY YOU DESCRIBE THIS MECHANISM THIS PLEASURE PAIN BALANCE THAT ALL SPEAKS TO THE KIND OF GENERALIZABILITY OF OR BRAIN CIRCUITRY AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT FASCINATES ME AND I KNOW IT FASCINATES YOU AS WELL WHICH IS THAT UM NATURE DID NOT EVOLVE TWENTY DIFFERENT MECHANISMS FOR TWENTY DIFFERENT TYPES OF EDDICTION JUST LIKE ANXIETY IS A COUPLE OF COURSETS OF HORMONS AND ARROW TRANSMITTERS IN PATHWAYS AND ONE PERSON IS TRIGGERED BY SOCIAL INTERACTIONS ANOTHER PERSON IS TRIGGERED BY A SPIDERS BUT THE UNDERLYING RESPONSE AS IDENTICAL SOUNDS LIKE WITH ADDICTION IS WELL THERE THERE MAY BE SOME NEW AUNTS BUT THAT THERE SORT OF A COAR SET OF PROCESSIES SO IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER IF IT'S GAMBLING OR VIDIO GAMES ORE SAX OR A NARRATIVE ABOUT A PREVIOUS LOVER OR PARTNER WHATEVER IT'S THE SAME ADDICTIVE PROCESS UNDERNEATH THAT IS THAT CORRECT YES EXACTLY AND THAT'S WHERE THIS WHOLE IDEA OF CROSS ADDICTION COMES IN SO ONCE YOU'VE BEEN ADDICTED TO A SUBSTANCE SEVERELY ADDICTED THAT MAKES YOU MORE VULNERABLE TO ADDICTION TO ANY SUBSTANCE AND WHEN YOU SAY SUBSTANCE AT DOES THE SAME DID  IS WHAT YOU JUST SAID ALSO TRUE FOR BEHAVIOUYES   WHEN A YOU WENT I USE THE WORD DRAG IER I'M TALKING ABOUT SUBSTANCES AND BEHAVIORS RIMLY AND BE AN TIKE MI BEHAVIORS LIKE GAMBLING SAC IM HORN GAINING CORN ABSOLUTELY SHABIN WER YOU VICUS OERS FORTHER AHERD A AND A DOCTOR LOVE GIVS IN EWSED ME NOT ACCUSE ME HAS I'M DOGNOSE ME A OUTSIDE THE CLIN AND A PLAYFIL WAY OF BEING WORK ADDICTOD YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT I'D THE FIRST THOUGHTS I HAVE WHEN I WAKE UP OR TYPICALLY ABOUT WORK SERANG WITHIN FIFTY MILL A SECONDS OR SO OF WAKING AND I'M PLAY THE LAST THOUGHTS I HAVE I WOULD HOPE OR NOT ABOUT WORK BUT I WORK CONSTANTLY I I DON'T I DO OTHER THINGS BUT I AT ACTIVELY TURN THAT AWYES THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT AND YOU'RE CERTAINLY NOT ALONE  IN THAT AND CLET STAMFORD NOA NONE AN I ME HERE IN THAO I NO RIHTS TIGELY REWARDINT RIGHTS O THAT KIND OF THAT KIND'S IMBEDED IN I YEABSOLUTELY AND AND THERE'S THIS OTHER CITY A THING IT'S CALLED NEW YORK WHERE THEY ALSO AND IT'S HEAVILY REWARDED AM I ONCE SAID AND I'M SURE THAT I'M NOT THE FIRST PERSON TO SAY IT BUT IM I WAS THINKING ABOUT ADICTION AND I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE UNDERLYING CIRCUITS AND AND I POSTED SOMETHING TO THE A TO THE TO SOCIAL ME DO AT SAID THAT A DICTION IS A PROGRESSIVE NARROWING OF THE THINGS THAT BRING YOU PLEASURE THAT WAS THE WAY THAT I CAN HAVE CRYSTALLIZED THE LITERATURE IN MY MIND AND THEN WE MET AND UAND YOU OF COURSE CAME IN I GIVE THESE AMAZING LECTURES IN THE AR AN AT OMY COURSE FOR THE MEDICAL STUDENTS AND AND THE REST AS HISTORY BUT I A I TOSSED OUT A KIND OF A MIRRORING STATEMENT FOR THAT AS WELL WHICH WAS A BIT AM OVERSTEPPING I ADMIT WHICH I SAID ADDICTION IS A PROGRESSIVE NARROWING OF THE THINGS THAT BRING YOU PLEASURE AND I SAIY DARE I SAY ENLIGHTENMENT IS A PROGRESSIVE EXPANSION OF THE THINGS THAT BRING YOU PLEASURE NOT THAT ANYBODY KNOWS WHAT IN L  BUT IT AS MY ATTEMPT TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF A JAB AT THE FACT THAT NOBODY KNOWS E AN HOW WHY NOT WHY WOEN NIG THREW HONER BY LOGICAL EXPLANATION JUST  JUST GON A SAMPLE THE WATERS IM AND PEOPLE HAD VARYING LEVELS OF RESPONSE BUT I WOULD' THE REASON I BRING THAT UP IS THAT I WOULD IMAGION THAT BEING ABLE TO DERIVE PLEASURE FROM MANY THINGS WOULD BE A WONDERFUL ATTRIBUTE WE KNOW PEOPLE LIKE THIS THAT IM CAN EXPERIENCE PLEASURE IN LITTLE THINGS AND IN BIG EVENTS I NOT JUST YOU KNOW THE BIG MILE STONES OF LIFE BUT ALSO THE SUBTLE YOU KNOW AS THE LIKE THE THE MEOGUSO SAY THE SUBTLE RIPPLES OF LIFE BUT IF SUCH AN ABILITY EXISTS WOULD DO THINK THAT THAT REFLECTS A HEALTHILY TUNED DOPA MEAN SYSTEM ONE THAT CAN ENGAGE AND ENJOY BUT THEN DISENGAGE IS THAT WHAT WE SHOULD BE SEEKING AND AND TO UNDERSCRI KNOW NOTHING ABOUT ENLIGHTEN MENT MEDITATION OR OR ANY OF IT I JUST AND I USE THESE AS OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPLORE YES SO IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AN AM AN AND I I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION AS SO WHERE WHAT SHOULD WE BE STRIVING FOR RIGHT WHERE WHERE SHOULD WE SETTLE OUT AND OU KNOW IN MY BOOK I REALLY HOLD OUT PEOPLE IN RECOVERY FROM SEVEREDICTION AS SORT OF MODERN DAY PROFITS FOR THE REST OF US BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN ADDICTED AND THEN GO GET INTO RECOVERY DO HAVE A HARD ONE WISDOM I'M THAT WE CAN ALL BENEFIT FROM AND IN THE WISDOM I GUESS YOU KNOW TO DISTILL IT DOWN I MEAN ITS ITS MANY THINGS BUT IN TERMS OF OU A DOPEA MEAN THAT THE WISDOM IS THERE ARE ADAPTIVE WAYS TO GET TOR DOPE MEN AND THERE ARE LESS THAN ADAPTIVE WAYS AND IN GENERAL AM YOU COULD DESCRIBE THE ADAPTIVE WAYS AS NOT TOO POTENT SO NOT TIPPING THAT BALANCE TOO HARD OR TOO FAST TO THE SIDE OF PLEASURE SO DOES THAT MEAN NEVER ALLOWING MYSELF TO BE ABSOLUTELY INCOMPLETE BLISS WHAT DOES IT MEAN NOT ALLOWING MYSELF TO STAY IN THAT STATE TOO LONG THE LATTER I THINK THE LATTER SO AND THAT THAN THAT GETS TO TEMPERAMENT SOME ON O GET THAT TO A SECOND SO SO IN GENERAL WHAT WE WANT IS SOME KIND OF FLEXIBILITY IN THAT BALANCE AND THE ABILITY TO RE EASILY REASSERT HOMIN A STATESUS W DON'T WANT TO BREAK OUR BALANCE WHICH IS POSSIBLE IF WE OVER INDULGE FOR ENOUGH PERIOD OF TIME AND END UP WITH A BALANCE TIP TO THE SIDE OF PAIN THE STOPENING DEFITS AT STATE WE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WE WANT AT WE WANT A FLEXIBLE RESILIENT BALANCE RIGHT WHICH CAN BE SENSITIVE TO THINGS GOING ON IN THE ENVIRONMENT WHICH CAN EXPERIENCE PLEASURE AND AF PROACH WHICH CAN EXPERIENCE PAIN AND RECOIL RIGHT THIS IS ALL ADAPTIVE AND HEALTHY AND NECESSARY AND GOOD WE WOULD NEVER WANT A BALANCE THAT DOESN'T TILT RIGHT THAT WOULD BE A DISASTER IGHT WE WOULDN'T BE HUMAN ON THE WE WOULD WANT THAT WE REALLY REALLY BORING ON THE OTHER HAND WHAT PEOPLE IN RECOVERY FROM ADDICTION TALK ABOUT IS TO SOME EXTENT HAVING TO LEARN TO LIVE WITH THINGS BEING A LITTLE BORING A LOT OF THE TIME RIGHT SO TRYING TO AVOID SOME OF THIS INTENSITY AND THRILL SEE ING AND ESCAPISM THAT REALLY IS AT THE CORE OF EDDICTIVE TENDENCIES A SORTIN TROBUT WE I SAY BORING IM CAN WE ADD STRESSFUL AND BORING YES BECAUSE THERE ARE DAYS WERE I'M NOT EXI HAVE TO IM WEN THEY'S TO HAVE TO REMIND MYSELF TO HAVE FUN BECAUSE IS SORE FORGOT WHAT THE TERM YES RANK AS I'VE I LIKE TO THINK THAT I EXPERIENCE A LOT OF PLEASURE IN LITTLE THAN'T WHAT I I'M PRETTY HARD DRIVING GUILE I LIKE GOLLS AND BIG MILESTONES ALL ORENOUGH ANYWAY IM THE POINT BEING THAT MANY DAYS I'M NOT BORED THINKING OTHERE'S NOTHING TO DO BUT I AM I'M OVERWHELMED BY THE NUMBER OF THINGS THAT ARE REALLY NOT PLEASUREFUL THEN I HAVE TO DO RIGHT I WON'T MENTION WHAT THEY ARE M OPLEGS AT'S WHY YOU DON'T YE ON EMALES UM NOT JUST YOUR REMAILUM NOT YOURES IN A OTHER UM IN ANY EVENT UM SO ANXIETY AND BORED UM CAN HANG OUT TOGETHER NM I RECTIN OH FOR SURE I MAN ACTUALLY BOREDOM IS HIGHLY ANXIETY PROVOKING O GET AS WELLIT'S GOOD TO KNOW CAUSE I CANT ABLE HEUR BORED OM ME HANG LIKE OTHER'S NOTHING TO DO HERE RA EIR'S NOT AND I YOUL LIKE WE HAVE A TON TO DO WE JUST DON'T REALLY WANT TO DO RI AS APPOSE TO SOMETHINGTHAT WERE EXCITED TO DO RIGHT O CASE SO SO THAT THIS GETS TO SORT OF SOME OF THE COOR THINGS ALSO WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER ABOUT FINDING YOUR PASSION SOME N TRY TO LINK AT ALL TOGETHER IM BUT BUT BASICALLY IS A BOREDUM FOR SO BORDOM IS A RARE EXPERIENCE FOR MODERN HUMANCE BECAUSE WE'RE CONSTANTLY DISTRACTING OURSELVES FROM THE PRESENT MOMENT AND WE HAVE AN INFINITE NUMBER OF WAYS TO DO THAT RIGHT IM BUT BORDOM IS REALLY I THINK IN IMPORTANT AND NECESSARY EXPERIENCE BUT IT IS SCARY BECAUSE WHEN YOU ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE BORED AN LETS SAY YOU WERE HAD THAT LIST OF ALL THINGS YOU HATE TO DO WHEN YOU ACTUALLY GOT THEM ALL DONE IMAGINE THAT AND YOU GOT YOUR FORTHCOMING BOOK DON HOW YOU DID ALL YOUR INNER VES AND AND ET APEN LIKENING  TA AND YOU D WATCH YOUR DOG AND YOU CLEANS YOUR HOUSE AND YOU WENT SHOPPING IMAGINE THAT FOR A MOMENT YOU WOULD BE SITTING IN YOUR HOUSE AND MY GUESS AS YOU WOULD BE TERRIFIED BECAUSE WELL WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO NOW RIGHT THERE'S NOTHING I REALLY HAVE TO DO AND THAT IS REALLY REALLY SCERYE THAT CAN FEEL LIKE FREEFALL AND YET THAT'S REALLY AN IMPORTANT AND GOOD EXPERIENCE TO HAVE AND I THINK THAT IS AN EXPERIENCE OUT OF WHICH WECAN HAVE A LOT OF CREATIVE UM INITIATIVE BUT ALSO REALLY CONSIDER OUR PRIORITIES IND VALUES O KE HERE I AM ON PLANED EARTH WHAT THE HE HALM I GOING TO DO WITH MY LIFE WHAT DO I REALLY CARE ABOUT HOW DO I REALLY WANT TO SPEND MY TIME WHEN I'M NOT DISTRACTING MYSELF YOU KNOW IN ORDER TO TO SPEND IT AND THA YOU KNOW THEN THIS GETSBECK TO OUR CONVERSATIONALOF EARLIER ABOUT FINDING YOUR PASSION SO I THINK THAT ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS NOW THAT'S VERY MISGUIDED ABOUT THIS IDEA OF INDING YOUR PASSION IT'S ALMOST AS IF PEOPLE ARE LOOKING TO FIT THE KEY INTO THE LOCK OF THE THING THAT WAS MEANT FOR THEM TO DO AND THEN EVERYTHING WILL FEEL LIKE A NATURAL RIGHT AND THEND EVERYTHING WILL BE WONDERFUL IN A CLESS TO THE THAT THAT IS NOT HOW IT WERE YA ENDEAVOR RIGHT AND THAT YOU'LL HAVE ALL THIS GREAT SUCCESS OR AND HERE HERE'S WEAR I REALLY THINK THE ANSWER LIES AND I REALLY REALLY BELIEVE THIS STOP LOOKING FOR YOUR PASSION AND INSTEAD LOOK AROUND RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE STOP DISTRACTING YOURSELF LOOK AROUND RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE AND SEE WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE SO NOT WHAT DO I WANT TO DO BUT WHAT IS THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND MORE IMPORTANTLY IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SOME GRANDIOTH'S WORK LIKE DOES THE GARBAGE NEED TO BE TAKEN OUT RIGHT IS THERE SOME GARBAGE ON YOUR NEIGHBORS LAWN THAT SOME ONE THROUGH THAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY BEND OVER AND PICK UP AND PUT INTO THE GARBAGE CAN LOOK AROUND YOU THERE IS SO MUCH WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE THAT NOBODY WANTS TO DO THAT IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT AND IF WE ALL DID THAT I REALLY THINK THE WORLD WOULD BE A MUCH BETTER PLACE AND THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEVERE ADICTION WHO GET INTO RECOVERY REALIZE THERE LIKE IT'S NOT ABOUT ME AND MY WILL AND WHAT I'M GOING TO WILL IN MY LIFE OR IN THE WORLD IT'S ABOUT LOOKING AROUND WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE WHAT IS THE WORK THAT I AM CALLED TO DO IN THIS MOMENT WHICH ALSO AS INCREDIBLY FREEING BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TO SEARCH FOR THE PERFECT THING THERE'S A LOT OF BURDEN OW ON YOUNG PEOPLE THAT THEY HAVE TO FIND THAT PERFECT THING AND UNTIL THEY'E FOUND THAT PERFECT THING THEY'REGING TO BE MISERABLE YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT LOOK AT THE LIFE YOU WERE GIVEN LOOK AT THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU LOOK AT THE JOBS THAT PRESENT THEMSELVES TO YOU AND DO THAT JOB SIMPLY AND HONORABLY ONE DAY AT A TIME IN WITH A KIND OF HUMILITY I THINK THIS IS REALLY WHAT WHATS SO STRIKING TO ME ABOUT THE WISDOM OF PEOPLE AND RECOVERY THERE'S THIS INCREDIBLE HUMILITY THAT COMES OUT OF THAT EXPERIENCE YOU FEEL SO BROKEN SO ASHAMED BUT YOU PICK YOURSELF UP ONE DAY AT A TIME AND YOU BUILD A LIFE THAT'S AROUND WHAT CAN I DO RIGHT IN THIS MOMENT THAT MIGHT BENEFIT ANOTHER PERSON AND THEREBY BENEFIT ME THAT'S UM A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT AND M AND IF YOU'RE WILLING I'D LIKE TO ASHALLY STAY ON THIS ISSUE OF PASSION BECAUSE I THINK THE DOPAMAN SYSTEMS I UNDERSTAND THEM CORRECTLY THE DOPAMAN SYSTEMS MERGE WITH THIS WORK THAT YOURE EFRIN TO THIS IMMEDIACY OF THINGS CALLING TO US LIKE TAKING OUT THE TRASH WHICH SOUNDS FRANKLY REALLY BORN NO O TE HONEST I I  TAKING OUT THE TRNOT I DO IT AS I LIKE A CLEAN HOME AND LOUN THAT ROUND THE SMELLS GOOD YA AMOR AT LEAST DOESN'T SMELL TAT AH SO WE DO THESE THINGS AND AM NOT THAT WE WANT TO OFFER SOME LARGER CARRET AS A CONSEQUENCE OF DOING THOSE THINGS BUT IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY WHAT YOURE SAYING IS IN THE ACT OF LOOKING AT ONE'S IMMEDIATE ENVIRONMENT ACTING ON THAT IMMEDIATE ENVIRONMENT WE CULTIVATE A RELATIONSHIP TO THESE CIRCUITS IN OUR BRAIN ABOUT ACTION IN REWARD THAT AT LEAST TO MY MIND SPEN THE RANGE OF SMALL THINGS BEING REWARDING AND THEN LEAD US TO BIGGER THINGS BEING REWONDING IT'S NOTLY ALL WE'RE GOING TO DO IS TAKE OUT TRASHION AND TEND TO HOUSE WE EVENTUALLY WILL VENTURE OUT AND WE VEND EVENTUALLY WILL FIND CAREERS AND AND WORK AL THOS BUT IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT GETTING INTO A SORT OF FUNCTIONAL OR ADAPTIVE ACTION STEP AND IT'S THE ACTION STEP THAT THESE DAYS WE TEND TO OVERLOOK BECAUSE MOST OF OUR MINE SAD IS IN THINGS THAT ARE TRULY IN OUTSIDE OF THE OUR IMMEDIATE REALITY DO I HAVE THAT CORRECT WE HAVE I WAS BEAUTIFULLY SAID AND I WOULD JUST ADD TO THAT I SEE A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO FOR EXAMPLE SPEND MOST OF THEIR WAKING HOURS PLAYING VIDO GAMES AND THEY COME TO ME IN THEY SAY I AM ANXIOUS AND DEPRESSED I MAYDRING IN COMPUTER SCIENCE I HATED I THOUGHT I WOULD LIKE IT YOU KNOW IF I COULD ONLY FIND THAT THING THAT I WAS REALLYD MEANT TO DO MY LIFE WOULD BE BETTER AND MY FIRST INTERVENTION FOR THE MANY MANY PEOPLE LIKE THAT THAT I SEE IN CLINICAL CAREIS YOU HAVE IT BACKWARDS I DON'T SAY IT QUITE LIKE THAT YOU WERE WAITING FOR THAT THING TO PULL YOU OUT OF THE VIDIO GAME WORLD AND YOU NEVER GONG TO FIND IT AS LONG AS YOU'RE PLAYING VIDIO GAMES CAUSE I VIDIO GAMES ARE SO POWERFULLY DOPEMAN URGIC THAT YOU HAVE THIS DISTORTED SENSE OF REALLY PLEASURE AN PAIN AND YOU YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO FIND THAT THING THAT YOU ENJOY AND SO OF COURSE THE INTERVENTION IS ABSTAIN FROM VIDIO GAMES RESET YOUR REWARD PATHWAYS START WITH A LEVEL BALANCE AND WHAT INVARYABWE HAPPENES TAT I'VE JUST SEEN IT OVER TWENTY YEARS SO MANY TIMES IV BECOME REALLY IN A BELIEVER IN THIS IM ALL TISEN IT'S LIKE O WOW MY COMPUTER SCIENCE CLASSES INTERESTING THIS QUARTER SLIK O QE YOU KNOW YOU YOU HAVE A RESEPTIVITY THEN TO EXPERIENCING PLEASURE IN REWARD IN A WAY YOU JUST DON'T HAVE WHEN YOU'RE BUMBARGING YOUR EWARD PATHWAYS WITH THESE HIGH DOPENING DRUGS VERY INTERESTING AM AND JUST TO UNDERSCORE THIS NOTION THAT TENDING TO THE IMMEDIATE THINGS CAN LEAD TO SUPERPERFORMENCE IM I MAY MENTION IT EARLIER THIS HAVISODE UM BUT IF I DIDN'T I MENTION NOW WHICHIS I'VE THE THE GREAT PRIVILEGE OF HAVING SOME CLOSE FRIENDS THAT WERE IN THE SEAL TEAMS IN DOING SOME WORK WITH THOSE COMMUNITIES AND IT'S A REMARKABLE COMMUNITY FOR REASONS I THINK MOST PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND WPEOPLE THINK THEY SEE THE IMMAGES CARRYING LONGSDOWN THE BEACH AN A BLONGSTUFF ON ALL THE LL THESTUFF THAT'S THAT'S FON FORGOTS LIKE THAT BUT AH ALL THE EYES I KNOW WHO ARE IN THE SEAL TEAMS HAVE THIS SEN NCE OF DUTY ABOUT IMMEDIATE THINGS  AD NOT JUST HOLDING THE DOOR AND DOING THAT HELPING WITH THE DISHES IN MOVINGS ROUND THEY ARE CONSTANTLY SCANNING THEIR ENVIRONMENT FOR WHAT CAN BE DONE THEY ESSENTIALLY CONQUER EVERY ENVIRONMENRAND THEY ARE ALSO SOME OF THEM THE MOST COMPETITIVE HUMAN BEING IN I THE WORLD AND THEY DO IT UNLESS THERE THE'RE IN THE ACT OF WORFIGHTING WHICH IS THE THE REAL JOB A THEY DO IT IN EVERY ENVIRONMENT IN VERY BENEVOLENT W AND IT'S A REMARKABLE THING BECAUSE IT I THINK IT'S WHAT IS PART OF WHAT THEIRE SELECTED FORM AND U ANTY OTHAT THERE'S A RANGE THERE BUT I THINK WHEN WE HEAR ABOUT TENDING TO THE IMMEDIATE THINGS O WERE THIS PHRASE A YOU KNOW HOW YOU DO ONE THING IS HOW YOU DO ANYTHING THAT'S A TRU TRICKY ONE FOR ME BECAUSE THEIRE CERTAIN THINGS I JUST DON'T DO WELL A BUT BUT SHOULD WE ALWAYS BE TRYING I I THINK THAT THE TENDING TO SETTING THE HORIZON IN CLOSELY UM AN TENDING TO THINGS IN ONE'S IMMEDI ENVIRONMENT I THINK IT IS VERY POWERFUL AND TRANSLATES YET AS AGAIN I THINK THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IT PERFORMS ALGARITHMS A D HAS ACTIONSTEPS THE BRAIN DOESN'T EVOLVE TO DO ONE RANG IT IS ALSE TO BE ABLE TO USE THE SAME APPROACH TO DOING LOTS OF DIFFERENT THING YES A I WHAT JUS WHAT N HANT EVEN BEYOND THAT CAUSE AT THAT TOTALLY RESINATES FOR ME AND IS VERY CONSISTENT WITH PEOPLE IN RECOVERY FROM ADDICTION WHO LEARN TO TAKE IT ONE DAY AT A TIME WHICH IS ONE OF THE YOU KNOW STANDARD LINGO FROM ALCOHOQS NONYMOUS ANOTHER TWELVE SEP GROUPS BUT BUT I THINK ALSO AS YOU SAY YOU KNOW OUR BRAIN IS REALLY WIRED FOR THE TWENTY FOR HOUR PERIOD WE'RE NOT VERY GOOD AT SORT OF THE YOU KNOW TEN YEAR TWHENTY ANDY WARE WE HAVE THISE YOUTRONALODES AND YES FOR GREAT PLANNERS AND WE CAN BUT IF WE LIVE TOO MUCH IN THAT SPACE WE CAN REALLY GET VERY ANXIOUS AND DEPRESSED AND LOST AND EITHER CATASTROPHISE OR GET GRANDIOSES BUT IF YOU CAN CHUNKIT DOWN TO A DAY WHAT WHAT PEOPLE IN RECOVERY TALK ABOUT IS HOW IF I CAN JUST DO TO DAY RIGHT THEN I WILL GET A CHAIN OF DAYS THAT SEEM INSIGNIFICANT IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL UNITS BUT AFTER SIX MONTHS OR YEAR TWO YEARS OF THOSE GOOD DAYS I'VE GOT TOO VERY GOOD YEARS RIGHT AND I LOOK BACK IN LIKE A WHOLE WY I GESS I I DID ALL THAT BUT THINK THAT'S REALLY YOU KNOW ONE OF THE KEYS IS IS REALLY TAKING IT ONE DAY T A TIME WHICH WHICH YOUR SEALS AND ALSO THIS CONNECTING WITH THE ENVIRONMENT RIGHT SO BEING AWAKEAN ALERT TO YOUR ENVIRONMENT AND CONNECTING WITH YOUR ENVIRONMENT NOT TRYING TO ESCAPE IT AND OF COURSE ESCAPISM IS WHAT WE ALL WANT AN DESIRE THAT EXPERIENCE OF NON BEING AND WE GET IT FROM THE INNER NATTER FROM DRUGS OR WHATEVER IT IS BUT IT IS IT'S THE BOOBY PRIZE WEBECAUSE ULTIMATELY IT TAKES YOU FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY FROM YOUR IMEDIA ENVIRONMENT WHICH IS WERE WE REALLY HAVE TO CONNECT TO GET THAT SENSE OF GROUNDEDNESS AND AUTHENTICITY AND LIKE OF BEING IN OUR OWN LIVES I THINK THE UNIT OF THE DAY IS SOMETHING THAT COMES UP AGAIN AND AGAIN OF IN MY DISCUSSIONS WITH COLLEAGUES WHO ARE EXTREME LY A SUCCESSFUL AND WHO ALSO HAVE BALANCE LIVE I O THISUSSION CAME UP IN THE DISCUSSION WITH CARL I SR OFF WHO IS ALSO IT'S A SUCCESSFUL SCIENTISTS INCLINATION AND AND OU ON'T MANAGES A FAMILY ET CETERA SO THE UNIT OF THE DAY I THINK IS FUNDAMENTAL AND THOSE STACK UP AS YOU MENTION SO ALONG THOSE LINES I'VE HEARD YOU SAY THAT IN ORDER TO RESET THE DOPAMING SYSTEM ESSENTIALLY IN ORDER TO BREAK IN ADDICTIVE PATTERN TO BECOME UNADDICTED THIRTY DAYS OF ZERO INTERACTION WITH THAT SUBSTANCE THAT PERSON ET CETERA IS THAT CORRECT YA AND AND THIRTY DAYS IS IN MY CLINICAL EXPERIENCE THE AVERAGE AMOUNT AT OF TIME IT TAKES FOR THE BRAIN TO RESET REWARD PATHWAYS FOR DOPEING TRANSMISSION TO REGENERATE ITSELF THERE'S ALSO A LITTLE BIT OF SCIENCE THAT SUGGEST THAT THAT'S TRUE SOME IMAGING STUDIES SHOWING THAT O'M OUR BRAINS ARE STILL IN A DOPENING DEFISITE STATE TWO WEEKS I'M AFTER WE'VE BEEN USING OUR DRUG AND THEN A STEADY BY SHUCK IT IN BROWN WHICH TOOK A GROUP OF A DEPRESSED MEN WHO ALSO WERE ADDICTED ALCOHOL PUT THEM IN A HOSPITAL WHERE THE THEY HAV RECEIVED NO TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION BUT THEY HAD NO NO ACCESS TO ALCOHOL IN THAT TIME AND AFTER FOUR WEEKS EIGHTY PERSENT OF THEM NO LONGER MET CRITERIA FOR MAJOR DEPRESSION SO AGAIN AE THIS IDEA THAT BY DEPRIVING OURSELVES OF THIS HIGH DOPEN E IN HIGH REWARD SUBSTANCE OR BEHAVIOR WE ALLOW OUR BRAINS TO REGENERATEIT DON'T OPENING  FOR THE BALANCE TO REAL EQUILLECRAT AND THEY WERE IN A PLACE WHERE WE CAN CORT ENJOY OTHER THINGS SO THAT PROGRESSIVE NARROWING OF WHAT I AS ONES PLEASURE ATUALLY EXPANSE SO I'D LIKE TI I'M DISSECT OUT THAT THIRTY DAYS AL FINELY IM AND I ALSO ONE TO ADDRESS HOW DOES ONE STOP DOING SOMETHING FOR THIRTY DAYS IF THE THING IS A THOUGHT NS I PUT THAT ON THE SHELL FR AT MOMENT SO DAYS ONE THROUGH TEN I WOULD IMAGINE WILL BE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE YES THEY'RE GOIN A SOCK RAHIALLY TO BE QUITE ONEST CA WATYOU THE WAY YOU DESCRIBE THIS PLEASURE PAIN BALANCE TO MY MIND SAYS THAT IF YOU REMOVE WHAT LITTLE PLEASURE ONE IS GETTING WERE LOT OF PLEASURE FROM ENGAGING IN SOME BEHAVIOR THAT'S GONE THE PAIN SYSTEM IS REALLY RAMPED UP AND NOTHING IS MAKING ME FEEL GOOD I TOSCEUSE MYSELF AS EXAMPLE I'M NOT IN RECOVERY BUT YOU DON'T THAT TEN DAYS IS GOING TO BE MISERABLE ANXIETY TROUBLE SLEEPING ET IM PHYSICAL AGITATION HE HAV THE POINT WHERE YOU DON'T IM TEY BE IMPULSIVE ANGRY SOULD SHOULD ONE EXPECT ALL OF THAT SHOULD THE FAMILY MEMBERS OF PEOPLE EXPECT ALL OF THAT YA SO WHAT I SAY TO PATIENCE AND IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE OF THIS INTERVENTION IS THAT YOU WILL FEEL WORSE BEFORE YOU FEEL BETTER I'M FOR HOW LONG YT IS ABI AT ES I I MA ASTRA AND AND I SAY USUALLY IN MY CLINICAL EXPERIENCE YOU'LL FEEL WORSE FOR TWO WEEKS BUT IF YOU CAN MAKE IT THROUGH THOSE FIRST TWO WEEKS THE SUN WILL START TO COME OUT IN WEEKTHREE AND BY WEEK FOR MOST PEOPLE ARE FEELING A WHOLE LOT BETTER THAN THEY WERE BEFORE THEY STOPED USING THEIR STUB IN SUBSTANCE SO IM YET YOU HAVE TO IT'S IT'S A HARD THING LIKE YOU HAVE TO SIGN UP FOR IT AND I WILL SAY OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE PEOPLE WITH EDICTIONS THAT ARE SO SEVERE THAT AS LONG AS THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR DRUG OR BEHAV OU THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO STOP THEMSELVES AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE IN O HIGHER LEVELS OF CARE OR RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT SO THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE FOR EVERYBODY THIS INVENTION BUT IT'S AMAZING HOW MANY PEOPLE WITH REALLY SEVERE ADICTIONS TO THINGS LIKE HAROIN COCANE YOU KNOW VERY SEVERE PORNOGRAPHY ADDICTIONS I POSIT THIS AND I DO IT IS AN EXPERIMENT I SAIDYOU TO LET LET'S TRY THIS EXPERIMENT I'M ALWAYS AMAZED NUMBER ONE HOW MANY OF THEM ARE WILLING AND NUMBER TWO HOW MANY OF THEM ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO DO IT THEY ARE ABLE TO DO IT AAND SO THAT LITTLE NUGE IS SORT OF JUST WHAT THEY NEED AND THE CAREIT IS YOU KNOW THERE'S A BETTER LIFE OUT THERE FOR YOU AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TASTE IT IN A MONTH YOU REALLY WILL BE ABLE TO BEGIN TO SEE THAT YOU CAN FEEL BETTER AN THAT THERE'S ANOTHER WAY SO THE WAY YOU DESCRIBE IT UM SEEMS LIKE IT'S HARD WUT IT'S DUABLE FOR MOST PEOPLE NOT EVERYBODY RIGHT AND WE'LL RETURN TO THE THAT CATEGORY OF PEOPLE WHO CAN'T DO THAT ON THEIR OWN UM WELL THEN DAY'S TWENTY ONE THROUGH THIRTY A PEOPLE ARE FEELING BETTER THE SUN IS STARTING COME OUT AS YOU MENTION THEY IT WHICH TRANSLATES IN THE NARRATIVE WE'VE CREATED HERE AND SPOR BY BIOLOGY THAT DOPAMEAN IS STARTING TO BE RELEASED IN RESPONSE TO THE TASTE OF A REALLY GOOD CUP OF COFFEE YES E EXACTLY WHEREAS BEFORE IT WAS ONLY TO INSERT YOU KNOW ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOR IGHTTHAT'S WHAT WHICHEVER  ORSE ACOPY CAN BE ADDICTED TO BUT IILL LEJUNOR I YE II COFFEE HAS A KIND OF AM CONSUMPTION LIMITING MECHANISM BUILT IN WERE AT SOME POINT YOU JUST CAN'T INJESTANY MORE YEM BUT MAYBE THAT'S WRONG SORRY TO GIV LEF TO HAVN ATICS NOTHIN AS I CLAS I OFO MY MY MONE AM SO DAYS TWENTY ONE THROUGH THIRTY AM I'VE SEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE GO THROUGH ADDICTION AND ADDICTION TREATMENT I SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN THOSE PLACES ACTUALLY A'M LOOKING AT IT RESEARCHING O GOT FRIENDS IN THAT COMMUNITY 'M CLOSE WITH THAT COMMUNITY ONE THING I'VE SEEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN SADLY OFTEN IN THE SAME INDIVIDUALS IS THEY GET SOBER FROM WHATEVER THEY'RE DOING GREAT YOU  PEOPLE WITH FAMILY IS THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT YOU DISCARD YOUR NORMAL IMAGE OF AN ATTIC AND INSERT THE MOST NORMAL TYPIC ULL WHATEVER HEALTHY PERSON YOU CAN IMAGINE CAUSE LOW THESE PEOPLE YOU WOULDN'T KNOW WERE ATTICS AND THEN ALL A SUDDEN YOU GET THIS CALL SO AND SOS BACK IN JAIL SO AND SOS WIFE IS GOING TO LEAVE HIM BECAUSE HE DRANK TWO BOTTLES OF OF WINE AND TOOK A ZANAX AT SEVEN A M CRASH IS TRUCK INTO A POLEIS GOT TWO BEAUTIFUL KIDS LIKE HOW DID THIS HAPPEN AGAIN TO THE POINT WHERE BY THE FOURCH IN FIFTH TIME PEOPLE ARE JUST DONE I MEAN NOT MAYBE PEOPLE YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO DETECT THE FRUSTRATION MY VOICE I'M DEALING WITH THIS WITH SOMEBODY THAT'S LIKE I DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT I WANT TO HELP THIS TIME IT'S BEEN SO MANY TIMES TO THE POINT WHERE I'M STARTING TO WONDER IS THIS PERSON JUST AN ATTIC THIS IS JUST CINE OT WHAT THEY DO IND WHO THEY ARE AND I AND YOU NEVER WANT TO GIVE UP ON PEOPLE BUT I MAND I'M HANGING IN THERE FOR THEM BAT I WILL SAY THAT I'M MANY PEOPLE HAVE GIVEN UP ON THEM AND SO WOULD I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IN THIS CONTACT IS WHAT SORTS OF THINGS HELP OTHER PEOPLE THAT WE KNOW THAT ARE ADDICTED WHAT REALLY HELPS MI NOT OT NOT WHAT COULD HELP WHAT REALLY HELPS AND ARE THERE CERTAIN PEOPLE FOR WHOM IT'S HOPELESS I MAY I DON'T LIKE TO HOLD THE CONVERSATION THAT WAY BUT I WOULDN'T BE CLOSE TO THE REAL LIFE DATA IF IF I DIDN'T ASK IS IT IS IT HOPELESS ARE THERE PEOPLE WHO JUST WILL NOT BE ABLE TO QUIT THEIR SUBSTANCE USE OR THEIR ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOR DESPITE I HAVE TO ASSUME REALLY WANTING TO YES SO THERE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WILL DIE OF THEIR DISEASE OF EDICTION YOU KNOWNT I THINK CONCEPTIONALIZING IT AS A DISEASE IS A HELPFUL FRAME THERE ARE OTHER FRAMES THAT WE COULD USE BUT I DO THINK GIVIN THE BRAIN PHYSIOLOGIC CHANGES THAT OCCUR WITH SUSTAINED HEAVY DRUG USE AND WHAT WE KNOW HAPPENS TO THE BRAIN ITIT IS REALLY REASONABLE TO THINK OF IT AS A BRAIN DISEASE AND AND FOR ME THE REAL WINDOW OF LETS AY BEING ABLE TO ACCESS MY COMPASSION AROUND PEOPLE WHO ARE REPEAT RELAPSERS EVEN WHEN THEIR LIFE IS SO MUCH BETTER WHEN THEY R NO YET YES IETS I DO NO BRAIN OR RIGHT I'M IS IS TO CONCEPTIONALIZE THIS BALANCE AND THE DOPENING DEFIS IT STATE AND A BALANCE TILL TILTED TO THE SIDE OF PAIN AND TO IMAGINE THAT FOR SOME PEOPLE AFTER A MONTH OR SIX MONTHS OR MAYBE EVEN SIX YEARS THEIR BALANCE IS STILL TIPPED TO THE SIDE OF PAIN THAT ON SOME LEVEL THAT BALANCE HAS LOST ITS RACILIENTS AND ITS ABILITY TO RESTORE HOMY ASTATES AND TOLL SIK THE HINGE ON THAT BYASMES NO EXACTLY AND SO I MEAN FOR FOR SOME ONE WHO'S NEVER EXPERIENCED ADICTION LIKE YOURSELF THAY BE ONE ONE WAY TO CONCEPTIONALIZE IT IS I DIDN'T SAY THA O WS I WUI WAS NI REFERRING TO MYSELF BUT I I IN THIS EXAMPLE WAS GIVEN I IF I WERE I WOULD I WOULD IM COME CLEAN I I WOULD REVEAL THAT IM BUT I I THINK THAT ESPECIALY AFTER HEARING SOME OF YOUR LECTURES AND DESCRIPTIONS OF THE RANGE OF THINGS THAT ARE ADDICT IF I HANK UM I'VE BEEN FORTUNET T I DON'T HAVE A PROPENSITY FOR DRUGS OR ALCAL RIGHT I'M YET I'M LUCKY IN THAT RAY THAT FRANKLY IF THEY REMOVE ALL THE ALL CALL FROM THE PLANET I'LL JUST BE RELIEVED BECAUSE NOONALL OFFER TO MERA RESO DON'T SEND ME ANY ALCAHOLL AN ON LIT GO TO ME RAM BUT I BUT I DON'T HAVE THAT IM I LIKE TO THINK I HAVE THE COMPASSION I'M BUT I DON'T HAVE THAT IM EMPATHY FOR YOU KNO TAKING A REALLY GOOD SITUATION AND WHAT FROM THE OUTSIDE RAY GLOWING IT RAAH YET SO CAN SOLF SELFS HUT LET THEM AND THIS IS REALLY I THINK IMPORTANT BECAUSE I I ALSO HAD TO COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF THIS AND I FEEL THAT I HAVE IN MY TWENTY YEARS OF SEEING THESE PATIENCE AND OF COURSE ADDICTION IS A SPECT FROM DE SURS RIGHT INS YOU'VE GET THE SEVERE AND OF THINGS I'M IMAGINE THAT YOU HAD IN ITCH SOMEWHERE ON YOUR BODY OKE AND IT WAS I MEAN WE'VE ALL HAD THAT LIKE IN WHATEVER THE SOURCE IT WAS SUPER SUPERIGY YOU CAN GO FOR YOU KNOW IF YOU REALLY FOCUS YOU COULD GO FOR A PRETTY GOOD AMOUNT OF TIME NOT SCRATCHING IT BUT THE MOMENT YOU STOPPED FOCUSSING ON NOT SCRATCHING IT YOU WOULD SCRATCH IT AND MAYBE YOU DO IT WHILE YOU WERE SLEEP RAT THATIS AND THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS TO PEOPLE WITH SEVERE ADDICTION THAT BALANCE ISENSUALLY BROKAN HO MEA STACIS DOES NOT GET RESTORED TO SPITE SUSTAINED ABSTINENCE THEY'RE LIVING WITH THAT CONSTANT SPATTER OF THAT PULL IT NEVER GOES AWAY SO THE ME SE THERE ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE WITH A DICTION FOR WHOM THAT DOES GO AWAY AND IT GOES AWAY T FOR WEEKS FOR MANY OF THEM BUT IN SEVERE CASES THAT'S ALWAYS THERE AND IT'S LINGERING AND IT'S THE MOMENT WHEN THEY'RE NOT FOCUSSING ON NOT USING IT'S LIKE A REFLECTTY FALL BACK INTO IT IT'S NOT PURPOSEFUL IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO GET HIGH IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY VALUE USING DRUGS MORE THAN THEY DO THEIR FAMILY NONE OF THAT IT'S THAT REALLY THEY THEY THEY CANNOT NOT DO IT WHEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY AND THAT MOMENT WHEN THEY'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT IT DOES I MAKE SENSE OF GREAT DESCRIPTION AND ACTUALLY IN THAT DESCRIPTION I CAN FEEL A BIT OF AMPATHY BECAUSE THE WAY YOU DESCRIBE SCRATCHING IN ENCH IN YOUR SLEEP YE IN I'VE I'VE DONE THAT WIF THE MOSQUITO BITES  LA GRATCHING LIKE I R SCRATCHING THAT RAMA MOSQUITO BY AND I ALSO HAVE TO ADMIT THAT I'VE EXPERIENCE NOT FEELING LIKE I WANT A PICK UP MY PHONE BECAUSE IT'S SO REWARDING BUT JUST FINDING MYSELF DOING IT YES F OR I DOM NOT GAN  US ISSING ON I USEHS THING AND AND THEN JUST FINDING MYSELF YET LIKE WHAT A MA RANG HERE RIGHT SO OF THA HOW DID I GET BACK YET AGAIN RIGT AND I I KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT BRAIN FUNCTION TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE CIRCUITS THAT GENERATE DELIBERATE BEHAVIOR AND WE HAVE CIRCUS THAT GENERATE REFLECTS OFE BEHAVIOR AND ONE OF THE GOALS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IS TO MAKE THE DELIBERATE STUFF REFLECTIVE SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE THE DECISION BECAUSE DECISION MAKING IS A VERY COSTLY THING TO DONCE ACT DECISION MAKING OF ANY CONRADE RIGHT SO THAT DOES REALLY HELP UM THE I I WANT ET JUST TRYING WEAVE TOGETHER THIS UM THIS DOPAMEAN PUZZLE HOWEVER BECAUSE IF BY WEEKLESS O FIRST PHASE OF THIS AW THIRTY OR FORTY DAY UM DETOCS IS LIKE A DOPAMIN FAST RIGHT MIGT O KIT FIRST TENDAYS ARE MISERABLE MIDDLETENDAYS THE CLOUDS AREOUT THERE MAY BE SOME CHARGS OF SUNLIGHT COMING THROUGH AND THEN ALL A SUDDEN SUN STARTS TO COME OUT AND GETS BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER WHY IS IT THEN THAT PEOPLE WILL RELAPSE NONCIOUS AFTER GETTING FIRED FROM A JOB OR THEIR SPOUSE LEAVING THE BUT WHEN THINGS ARE GOING REALLY WELL IS IT THIS UNCONSCIOUS MECHANISM CAUSE I'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE IS A THEY HAVE A GREAT WIND I'VE A FRIEND WHO'S A REALLY IMPRESSIVE CREATIVE I'M I DON'T WANT A REAL ANY MORE THAN THAT BUT A AND RELAPSED UPON GETTING ANOTHER REALLY TERRIFIC OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD AN ILS HOW CAN THAT HAPPEN BUT NOW I'M BEGINNING TO WONDER WAS IT THE DOPAMIN ASSOCIATED WITH THAT WINTHAT OPEN THE SPIGINT ON THIS DOPAMIN SYSTTEM BECAUSE IM IT HAPPENED IN A PHASE OF OF A REALLY GREAT STRETCH OF WHAT YERIGHT YES YOU YOU RAISE THAT GREAT POINT ABOUT TRIGGERS RIGHT AND TRIGGERS ARE THINGS THAT MAKE US WANT TO GO BACK TO USING OUR DRUG AND THE KEYTHING ABOUT TRIGGERS WHATEVER THEY ARE IS THEY ALSO RELEASE A LITTLE BIT OF DOPAMIN RIGHT SO JUST THINKING ABOUT IUM WHATEVER THE TRIGGER IS THAT WE ASSOCIATE WITH DRUG USE OR JUST THINKING ABOUT DRUG USE CAN ALREADY RELEASE THIS ANTICIPATORY DOP MEAN THIS MEW LITTLE MANY SPIKE BUT HERE'S THE PART THAT I THINK IS REALLY FASCINATING THAT MINY SPIKE IS FOLLOWED BY A MINY DEFICITE STATES OH IT GOES UP AND THEN IT DOESN'T GO BACK DOWN TO BASE WHEN IT GOES BELOW BASELINE TONIC LEVELS AND THAT'S CRAVING RIGHT SO THAT ANTICIPATION IS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY WANTING THE DRUG AND IT'S THAT DOPEING DEFICITE STATE THAT DRIVES THE MOTIVATION TO GO AND GET THE DRUG SO MANY PEOPLE TOLK ABOUT DO MEAN IS NOT REALLY ABOUT PLEASURE BUT ABOUT WANTING AND ABOUT MOTIVATION AND SO IT IS THAT DEFICITE STATE THAT THEN DRIVES THE LOCOMOTION TO GET IT AND EARLIER YOUR DESCRIPTION OF DOPAMIN BE INVOLVED IN THE DESIRE FOR MORE GIVING THE SENSE OF REWARD BUT ALSO MOVEMENT WHY I HAVE TO ASSUME THAT THOSE THINGS ARE BRAGTED TO GE AAIN  NERVOUS SYSTEM YO HAV OR THE SPECIFIC INTENTION OF WHEN YOU FEEL SOMETHING YES GOOD THEN YOU FEEL THE PAIN YAB YOU DON'T NOTICE IT THAT DON THE NEXT TO YOU KNOW YOU'RE PURSUING MORE OF THE YETHINGS AND I LEFE THE WAY YOU USES THE WORD BRADED TOGETHER THAT'S BEAUTIFUL AND LET ME ALSO JUST SAY USAN THT I O FIND ALLSO FASCINATING IN MY WORK WITH PATIENCE AND I SEE THIS ALL THE TIME THERE ARE PEOPLE FOR WHOM THAD LIFE EXPERIENCES LOSTS YOU KNOW WIN ANY FORMS TRASTS IN MANY DIFFERENT FORMS THAT'S A TRIGGER BUT THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY PEOPLE FOR WHOM THE TRIGGER IS THINGS GOING WELL AND THE THINGS GOING WELL CAN BE LIKE THE REWARD OF THE THINGS GOING WELL BUT VERY OFTEN WHAT IT IS IS THE REMOVAL OF THE HYPROVIGILANCE DATE THAT'S REQUIRED TO KEEP THEIR USE IN CHECK SO IT'S THE SENSE OF I WANT TA CELEBRATE YOU KNOW OR I WONDER THIS REWARD HAPPENED I ONE UT PUT MORE REWARD ON THERE AND IT'S REALLY REALLY FASCINING BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE COME TO THAT REALIZATION TH BOUT THEMSELVES THAT THE'RE MOST OVULNERABLE WHEN THINGS ARE GOING WELL UM THAT'S REALLY A VALUABLE INSIGHT BECAUSE THEN THEY CAN PUT SOME INO THINGS AN PLACE OR BARRIERS AND PLAYS ORE GOI TO MORE MEETINGS ORE WHATEVER IT IS THAT THEY DO YOU KNOW TO PROTECT THEMSELVES ALONG THOSE LINES I HAVE A FRIEND A FORTY YEARS SOBER WAS A SEVERE DROGAN I'LL CALL OUTIC FOR A VERY YOUNG AGE REALLY IMPRESSIVE PERSON AS A LOT OF IMPORTANT WORK IN THE UM CON OF AT RISK YOUTH COMMUNITY OUT AND WHY AND HE SAID SOMETHING TO ME HE SAID A AS FORMER ATICS OFTEN DO THEY GOT THESE GREATE SAYINGS UM BUT I THINK IT FIT'S VERY WELL WITH WHAT YOU'RE DESTRIVING HE SAID YOU KNOW NO MATTER HOW FAR YOU DRIVE YOU'RE ALWAYS THE SAME DISTANCE AND AN AND I SAID THAT'S KIND OF DEPRESSING AND HE SAID KNOW THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT GIVES ME PEACE YE BECAUSE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS FOR SO MANY YEARS OF RELAPSING AND RELAPSIND GETTING RECOVERING AND RELAPSING HE FELT LIKE IT WAS HOPELESS AND THEN SOMEHOW CONCEPTIONALIZING THAT THE VIGILANCE CAN NEVER GO ANINSTEAD OF MAKING HIM FEEL BURDEN YA IT MADE HIM FEEL RELIEVED SO I OFTEN THING ABOUT THAT THAT STATEMENT YOU KNOW NO MATTER HOW FAR YOU DRIVE YOU'RE ALWAYS THE SAME DISTANCE FROM THE DITCH BECAUSE IN MY MIND I CONCEPTIONALIZED THAT AS GOSH THAT'S A THAT'S A TOUGH WAY TO DRIVE DOWN THE ROAD BUT ACTUALLY ON A ROAD WHERE YOU KNOW WHERE THE DITCHIS AND WEOU KNOW WHERE THE LANE LINES ARE IT'S ASHALLY PRETTY NICE DRIVE IT'S WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THE SHOULDER IS THAT YOU COSTANTLY HAVE TO BE LOOKING AROUND SO THERE'S THIS WHERE IT WERE SPEAKING NOW AN IN ANALOGIES AND AN IMAGERY A AN SCIENCE BUT I ONE OF THINGS I FIND SO INCREDIBLE ABOUT THIS COMMUNITY OF TWELVE STEP IN THEIR VER AVARIETY OF THEM OR THE AM THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY CREATE FOR THEMSELVES IM AND  SOME OF THESE THINGS WHICH I DO BELIEVE LINK BACK TO REALLY COR BIOLOGICAL MECHANISM YES YES I DO ON'T ASK ABOUT THOSE COMMUNITIES AI HAVE A QUESTION WHICH MIGHT BE ELUIBIT UM CONTROVERSIAL A FAINTS WHICH IS IS IT POSSIBLE THAT PEOPLE WHO WERE ADDICTED TO DRUGS OR ALCALL OR SOM GAMBLING OR SOME OTHER BEHAVIOR GET ADDICTED TO THE ADDICTION COMMUNITY BECAUSE ONE THING THAT I THINK I OBSERVE OVER AND OVERS THAT THERE'S SOME CIRCUIT IN THE BRAIN OF HUMAN BEINGS THAT HAS TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE DREAM THEY HAD THE NIGHT BEFORE FOR ONE OF ER REASON OM THERE'S ANOTHER CIRCUIT THAT LEADS PEOPLE TO A WAKE YOU UP IF THEY THEMSELVES CAN'T SLEEP I DON'T KNI MANE PHYSICAS HERE BUT THERE DOES SEEM TO ALSO BE A CIRCUIT IN THE BRAIN OF ATTICS TO DISGUSS AND WANT TO YOUCAN TALK ABOUT THEIR RECOVERY A LOT AND I MENTION THIS NOT TO POKE AT THEM BUT RATHER THE OPPOSITE BECAUSE I THINK THAT ONE THING THAT IS CHALLENGING T LEAST FOR ME AND HAVING FRIENDS THAT THAT HAVE A PROPENSITY FOR DRUGGER OU CALL ADICTION NOT ALL HON UT CERTAINLY SOME OF THEM IS WHEN THERE TIME AT THE RECOVERY I FEEL LIKE IT'S ALL THEY TALK ABOUT THIS MEATING THAT MEAN THEMI UM HOW ARE WE SO WHAT I'M REALLY ASKING HERE IS AM IS THAT SOMECAN WE BECOME ADDICTED TO SOBRIETY RIGHT SO THIS IS A GREAT QUESTION AND IT LINKS INTO SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HAVING TO DO WITH WHERE DO WE SETTLE SETTLE OUT YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE WAY TO LIVE BETWEEN PLEASURE AND PAIN AND I IMPLIED EARLIER THAT ULTIMATELY WE WANT A RESILIENT BALANCE THAT SENSITIVE TO PLEASURE AND PAIN BUT THAT CAN EASILY RESTORE HOMIASTASIS AFTER WE INDULGE EVEN WHEN WE ENDULGE GREATLY IM BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT PEOPLE WITH SEVERE ADDICTION I BELIEVE TEMPERAMENTALLY WANT THOSE EXTREMES AND THEIR WIRED FOR THAT KIND OF INTENSITY THAT IS MORE THAN JUST THESE SLIGHT ADJUSTMENTS AROUND THE FULL CRUM RIGHT IT'S LIKE THEY WANT THE BIG HIGHES AN THE BIG LO THEY'LL SAY GREAT MEATING YET I OWA SEGRASINS WHERE THEY FIND AN RA YVEIN A GROUP IN A LOCATION YE TIKE WE SI THIS IS ALMOST AN INSIDE JOKE IN THOSE CMENS AGAIN I'M NOT REPORT I'M NOT TIME NOT A FRIEND IN QUOZIS ISN'T ME REPORTING WITH THE IM THEY'LL TAK ABOUT HOW ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE ALREADY GIVEN MEETING OR HOW HOW BONDED THEY FEEL AAT A GIV EANING A MEETINGS IT THEMSELVES RAG ON THEIR OWN FORM OF DOPOMI YE YES YEND AND IGAIN OM NOT BING DISPARAGING NOS I I WON'T UNDERSTAND RA SO YES SO SO A LOT OF TIME'S PATIENTS ILL SAYTO ME OH YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT TO GO TO A IT'S A CULT AND MY RESPONSE TO THAT IS BECAUSE IT'S A CULT IS EXACTLY WHY IT WORKS OKET BECAUSE YES IT IS MUCH BETTER FOR YOU TO BE ADDICTED TO A A AND TO RECOVERY THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER ADDICTION I COULD THINK OF AND WE KNOW FROM RABOLINKA'S WORK IS HERE ANT STAMFORD THAT OXY TOST IN AM YOU KNOW IS THE HORMONE THAT' INVULGED IN HUMAN PAIR BONDING AND RELATIONSHIPS IN LOVE AND IT DIRECTLY LINKS TO DOKE ME NURONS AND CAUSES THE RELEASE OF DON'T MEAN SO YES WHEN WE CONNECT WITH OTHER HUMANS ESPECIALLY IN A KIND OF TRANSCENDENT SPIRITUAL WAY THAT'S A HUGE DOPE MEAN HIT AND IT DOES REPLACE THE DON'T MEAN THAT PEOPLE GET FROM DRUGS AND FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE THIS ADDICTION TEMPERAMENT THEY NEED IT ON A MORE INTENSE LEVEL THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE GENERALLY SATISFIED WITH KIND OF YOU KNOW AN A SORT OF ACQUAINTANCE SHIP RIGHT THEY THEY THEY WANT THAT INTENSITY OF THE INTIMACY THAT YOU GET WITH PEOPLE WHEN YOU'RE CATHARDICALLY EXPOSING YOU KNOW WORTS AN ALL SO YES PEOPLE CAN GET A DICTED TO RECOVERY AND GOOD FOR THEM GO FOR IT YOU KNOW AND OF COURSE THIS CAN BE DESRUPTIVE FOR FRIENDSHIPS AND AN RELATIONSHIPS WHERE THE ONE PERSON IS NOT IN RECOVERING LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO SO MANY MEEDTINGS YOU'RE ALWYS IE TO RECOVERY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT MUCH BETTER THAN THEM BEING INTOXICATED RIGHT I MEAN SO ALTHOUGH YOU MAY TIRE OF YOUR FRIENDS TALKING ABOUT THERE THERE YOU NOMUNILES I'ME I'M SURE YOU WOULD RATHER HAVE THEM DO THAT THAN THAN YOU KNOW BE IN THEIR ADDICTIONS NOW ABSOLUTELY AND AM THIS NOW THE SECOND TIME YOU'VE DONE TA ESPECIAL MO NOW I HAVE EMPOTHY BECAUSE THE WAY YOU DESCRIBE THEY'RE ENTHUSIASM ABOUTT MEETINGS YES IS PROBABLY THE WAY THAT PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT ME Y R RIT AND MY IN NORL SCIENCE I MEAN I'VE BEEN GETTING UP IN FRONT OF THE CLASS SINCE I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD AND TALKING ABOUT THINGS I READ OVR WE CAN NOW I JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE THIS THING CALL THE PODCAWNS AMT IT SEVEN NEW IN SINCE IAS LL AND IN MANNOISE A LOT OF PEOPLE RIGHT I'VE LEARNED TO SUPPRESS IN A RA SOME PEOPLE LIKE IT BUT I I'M POKING FON OF MYSELF JUST TO SAY THAT I NOW CAN I UNDERSTAND THAT THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT THEIR REPORTS ABOUT YET ANOTHER AMAZING MEETING WOR AND WOR FOR THIS A DIFFERENT FORM OF THIS BUT THEYR'RE SOME PEOPLE FOR WHICH THEY JUST LOVE INTENSE EXPERIENCES YET THEY'RE ALWAYS LIKE TRUN OF PULL ME OFF TO BOLLY BECAUSE THEY'VE TALKING ABOUT HOW SENSUAL IT IS ALL DI'M SURE BOLLY'S WONDERFUL IF THERE'S THIS KIND OF RACHIONING UP IT'S LIKE SEEKING BURNING MEN ALL HANG I'VE NEVER BEEN AVERING MAN NO DESIRE TO GO TO BURNING MAN AM AM BUT INSIDE OF ACADAMIA I MEAN IF I WERE TO JUST TURN THE MER AT MYSELF INSIDE OF ACADAMIA OR HERE INSULT CON TNOWLED WORK AND THE PERSI OF MORE SUCCESS EVEN IF MONEY IS AND OF DIVORCE FROM THAT SOMETIMES IT IS SOMETIMES IT ISN'T ACADEMIC WORK IS YOU KNOW FORSAKE OF PURSUIT OF KNOWLEDGE IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THE SAME MECHANISM AND THAT IT FEELS TO ME VERY MUCH LIKE THE THE THE SAME MECHANISM SO ANDREW HEAR'S WHAT I LOVE ABOUT YOU FIRST OF ALL YOU'RE WILLING TO BRING YOUR OWN FLAWS AND FOIBLES TO THIS CONWELLS TERE ESRER OW NO WHI IT'S WONDERFUL AND THEN YOU REALLY OPEN AND CURIOUS AND WANTING TO UNDERSTAND CAUSE I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY PEOPLE I HAVE MET WHO REALLY SEE ADDICTION AS SOME KIND OF OTHER NETS BUT THE TRUTH IS WE'RE ALL WIRED FOR ADICTION AND IF YOU'RE NOT ADDICTED YET IT'S IT'S JUST IT'S RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER YOU K OW WHAT I MEAN ESPECIALLY WITH THE INCREDIBLE PANIPLY OF NEW DRUGS AND BEHAVIORS THAT ARE OUT THERE SO I LOVE THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE A MOMENT AND REALLY TRY TO UNDERSTAND THIS BECAUSE IT IS IT IS WE CAN ALL RELATE AND YOU'RE RELATING IT TO YOUR ESSENTIALLY YOUR WORK ADDICTION IS RIGHT AND AN APT YOU JUST HAPPEN TO BE ADDICTED TO SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY SOCIALLY REWARDED YOU KNOW YOU FIGURED THAT OUT IN N EARLY AGE OH WHEN I DO EX CY AND ZEE ALLTHSE PEOPLE GO LOOK AT THAT SMART KID OR WHATEVER IT IS YOU KNOW YO WERE ME MADE ME FEEL SAFE O  I FELT LIKE UM YE I JUST FELT LIKE THIS AND AT PAUSTERE CAUSIS LIKE IT'S LIKE PEACE I'M LIKE I CAN RELAX FOR A MOMENT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT NARRS ON WO KNO OR JUST WHEN I'M WHEN I'VE WHEN I FEEL LIKE I'M ON THE RIGHT PATH AH AND I'M ON TO SOME THING OR IF I SEE SOMETHING THAT I'M EXCITED WA I'M LIKE I FEEL UM FILLED WITH IT MUST BE DOPENME YAVE YOU'LL FLOT IN WITH PLEASURE LERELY  HADED TO A AND THEN MY NEXT THOUGHT IS MORE TOUY YOUAREYOU'RE ROU'RE REALLY YOU'RE DAR AT O YEN YOU ARENT YOU YOU ARE BUT YOU JUST GOT REALLIR THINK I YOU REALLY GOT LUCKY WIN A FACT THAT THAT WAY YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DRAWN TO IS IS ADAPTIVE ESSENTIALLY YOU KNOW I MEN AN THEN YOUR CHALLENGES GOING TO BE THAT YOUR LIFE DOESN'T GET TOO OUT A BALANCE IN THE SENSE THAT YOUR TWENTY FOUR SEVEN WORK AND YOU DON'T STOP AND DO SOME OTHER TERMIS OR THINK ABOUT IT AND  O LIFE AND MY LIFE AD MITDELY IS SOMEWHAT E EMMETRIC I MEAN IT HAS OTHER COMPONENTS OF PHYSICAL HEALTH AT SETTER BUT IS AROUND SOMEON ASS EMMETRIC IM HICH IS WHY GOT A DOG ALTHOUGH I TALK ABOUT HIM AN AWFUL LOT SO UM BUT THE DOG IS GOOD BECAUSE THAT DROS YOU OUT OF YOURSELF IN A LITTLE BIT AWAY FROM THE WORK BUT AGAIN YOU KNOW I THINK THE KEY HERE IS FOR PEOPLE IF FEEL LIKE THEY DON'T THEY'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED ADDICTIONER THEY DON'T KNOW ANYBODY WITH A DICTIONER IF THEY DO THEY DON'T GET IT JUST THINK OF THAT ONE THING THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN YOUR LIFE THAT YOU DO THAT GIVES YOU PLEASURE AND MEANING IN PURPOSE AND THEN IMAGINE IF YOU COULDN'T DO IT I YET LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT THAT WHY APPRECIATE THAT THE FEED BACK AND NAT YOU CAN SEND ME ABILI EM WHAT IS THE MOST RIDICULOUS SOUNDING ADDICTION THAT YOU'VE EVER WITNESSED THAT WAS ACTUALLY A REAL EDDICTION ALON THESE LINES IUM BECAUSE I I THINK WE ALL KNOW THE STANDARD HEROINE PILLT YOU'VE BEEN VERY I SHOULD MENTION UM BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT YOUR PREVIOUS BOOK IM AND WEILL PRYTOLING TO THAT AS WELL FOCASSED ON THE OPIO CRISIS AND UM WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS MEDICATION TURNED OUT TO BE JUST AS BAD IF NOT WORSE THAN A LOT OF SO CALLED STREET DRUGS A SO WE UNDERSTAND THOSE THOUGH YOUN GAMBLING SEXATION PORNEDICTION NOW VIDIO GAMES WILL TALK ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA WILL BET MORE IN DEPTH BUT WHAT'S THE MOST LIKE WOW I DIDN'T REALIZE PEOPLE COULD GET ADDICTED TO THAT WATER REALLY REALLY SO I HAD A VERY LOVELY PATIENT WHO WAS AHAD A SEVERE ALCOHOLIDICTION AND SHE GOT INTO RECOVERY FROM HER ALCOHOLIDICTION AM FOR MANY YEARS BUT SHE KIND OFE HAD A SORT OF A POLYDIPSIERRA AND URGED TO BE DRINKING SOMETHING A LOT AND SO SHE DRANK A LOT OF WATER AND SLOWLY OVER TIME SHE REALIZED THAT IF SHE DRANK ENOUGH WATER SHE COULD BECOME HYPONY TREMIC AND DELIRIOUS AND BE OUT OF HERSELF WHO DIVE FROM IT RIGHT WHICH IS WHACH SH JUST WANTED TO BE OUT OF HER OWN HEAD AND SO SHE WOULD PERIODICALLY INTENTIONALLY OVER DOSE ON WATER IN ORDER YOU KNOW TO TO I KNOW IT WAS TI SO  SAD SO SAD WHAT HAPPENED HER SHE EVENTUALLY TOOK TOOK HER OWN LIFE WHO AS REALLY ANSROU SHE WAS A LOVELY WOMAN OF SHE WAS SO BRIGHT SHE HAD SO MANY INTERESTS AND PASSIONS AND AND OF COURSE IT WAS VERY SAD WHEN YOU KNOW WHEN SHE DIED BUT BUT I THAT WAS AWHILE TO ME IT WAS LIKE WHILE IF YOU HAVE THIS DISEASE OF EDICTION YOU CANT EVEN GET ADDICTED TO WATER WELL AND I THING IT JUST UNDERSCORS THE THE GENERALIZE ABILITY OF THESE CIRCUITS RIGHT IS THERE ISN'T A BRAIN CIRCUIT FOR ADDICTION TO WATER THAT SHE HAPPEN HAVE THERE'S A BRAIND CIRCUIT FOR PLEASURE AND PAIN AND RADICTION AND WATER PLUGGED IN TO THAT RASURS IT RIGHT WELL THAT'S IT THAT'S INTENSE AM IN YOUR BOOK A DOPEME NATION YOU ALSO DESCRIBE SOME AMAZING PAS TO RECOVERY PEOPLE THAT AM YOU KNOW FROM READING IT I WOULD I WON'T SAY WHICH ONES AND WHO CAUSE THERE' SOME GREAT SURPRISES IN THE BOOK TO BOTH AM TRAGIC AN AND AND TRIUMPHANT AS THEY SAY AM YOU'VE OFTEN DESCRIBE YOUR PATIENCE AS YOUR HEROES YE HAVE YET'S ALSO TIT MOREMO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT HOW HARD IT IS TO GIVE UP A DRUG OR A BEHAVIOUR THAT YOU'RE ADDICTED TO HOW MUCH COURAGE THAT TAKES AND FORTITUDE AND DISIPPLINE AND STIC TOITIVENESS THESE PEOPLE ARE REALLY AMAZING PEOPLE I MEAN THAT'S I I DON'T KNOW THAT I COULD DO IT WHAT THEY WHAT THEY DO YOU KNOW IT'S AND LIKEIN WE TALKED O A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IU JUST THE CONSTANT EVER PRESENT URGED TO USE EVEN AFTER SUSTAIN PERIODS OF ABSENCE FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT'S REALLY REALLY HARD AND OF COURSE THAN YOU DOUBLE DOWN ON THE SHAME THAT THAT THEY FEEL BECAUSE OF THAT URGED EVEN WHEN THEIR LIVES ARE SO MUCH BETTER MEAN THESE PEOPLE ARE REALLY REALLY REMARKABLE AND YOU TAKE THE REMARK REMARKABLE ACCOMPLISHMENT AND THEN YOU IMAGINE THE WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN NOW WHERE WE ARE CONSTANTLY INVITED AND TEMPTED AND REALLY BUMBARDED WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO BECOME ADDICTED LEGATILIAN ITCH EVERYWHERE OH YE I'M YOU CAN'T ESCAPE IT YOU KNOW YOU CANNOT ESCAPE IT THAT YOUL GET I YE MAIL IN YOUR INBOX INVITING YOU TO DO EXUIRES THE AND IF YOU'R ADDICTED TO THAT THING AND YOU KNOW YOU TRIED TO LIKE TO LEAD ALL YOUR ABS AND NOT CO HERE ALL THE SUDDEN YOU'RE WORK IN BOXURE YOU KNOW YOU'RE GETTING THOSE IMAGES LET'S SAY REALLY REALLY REALLY HARD AND YET THESE PEOPLE FIND A WAY TO DO IT I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY AMAZING AND THEY'RE REALLY WISE PEOPLE THEY HAVE SO MUCH WISDOM TO FOR THEY'VE TAUGHT ME ALOT YOU KOW AS I TALK ABOUT MY ABOOK I HAVE MY OWN EDICTIONS AND I REALLY JUST LIKE TOOK A PAGE READ OUT OF THEIR BOS O PAY WHAT DO I DO NOW AR I WHATTED THIS PATIENT TO AT ABOUT CAW WEN A TRI THIT IS IS IN AMAZING COMMUNITY YV THE PEOPLE THET THEY ARE VERY SAGE I WANTED TO ON JUST TOUCH ON SOMETHING THAT YOU MENTION WHICH IS OF THE SHAME H YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T GO TO A MEETING  OR TALK TO ATICS WITHOUT UM DETECTING OR OR HEARING ABOUT LIKE LIE SHAME ET CETERA I HEARD YOU SAY ON IN INTERVIEW WITH SOMEBODY ELSE RECENTLY THAT TRUTH TELLING AND SECRETS OUR SEROF AT THE CORE OF RECOVERY AND OM ET TELL US MORE ABOUT THAT YES SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I FOUND REALLY FASCINATING ABOUT WORKING WITH PEOPLE IN RECOVERY WAS HOW TELLING THE TRUTH EVEN ABOUT THE MEREST DETAIL OF THEIR LIVES WITH CENTRAL TO THEIR RECOVERY AND I BECAME REALLY CURIOUS ABOUT THAT LIKE WHY WOULD TRUTH TELLING BE SO IMPORTANT ANDOF COURSE THERE IS THE OBVIOUS THING THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE IN THEIR EDDICTION THEI'RE LYING ABOUT USING YOU KNOW SO PART OF GETTING INTO RECOVERY IS TO STOP LYING TO THE PEOPLE THEY CARE ABOUT ABOUT THEIR USE BUT IT'S REALLY MORE THAN THAT BECAUSE WHAT WUT PEOPLE IN RECOVERY HAVE TAUGHT ME IS THAT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT EVEN JUST NOT LYING ABOUT USING DRUGS I HAVE TO NOT LIE ABOUT ANYTHING I CAN'T LIE ABOUT WHY WAS LATE TO WORK THIS MORNING WHICH WE ALL DO AH I HITTRAFFIC NOW I DIDN'T HITTRAFFIC I WANTED TO SPEND TWO MORE MINUTES READING THE PAPER AND DRINKING MY COFFEE WRITE  OR JUST LYING ABOUT YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHERE I HAD DINNER LIKE SO PEOPLE WITH ADDICTION WILL GET INTO KNOW THE LYING HABIT WHER THEY'RE LYING ABOUT RANDOM STUFF CAUSE THEYARE SORT OF IN THE HABIT OF LINE AND HOW RECOVERYES REALLY ABOU TELLING THE TRUTH YOU KNOW IN ALL WAYS AN SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WHAT I HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH IT IN WRITING THE BOOK IS SORT OF EXPLORING IN THE NARROW SCIENCE AROUND WHY TRUTH TELLING IS IMPORTANT TO LEADING ABALANCE LIFE AND WE KNOW LIKE EVERY RELIGION SINC THE BEGING OF TIME IS ALL ABOUT TELLING TRUTHFUL WHY WRIT AND THERE'S REALLY INTERESTING NARROW SCIENCE BEHIND IT THAT SUGGEST THAT WHEN WE TELL THE TRUTH WE ACTUALLY PETENTIALLY STRENGTHEN OUR PREFRONTIAL COURT CARTICAL CIRCUITS AND THEIR CONNECTIONS TO OUR LYMBIC BRAIN AND OUR REWARD BRAIN AND OF COURSE THESE ARE THE CIRCUITS THAT GET DISCONNECTED WHEN WE'RE IN OUR EDICTION RIT OUR BALANCE IN OUR REWARD PATHWAY OR LYMBIC BRAIN OUR MOTION BRAIN IS DOING ONE THING AND OUR CORTICAL CIRCUITS ARE COMPLETELY DISENGAGE FROM THAT IGNORING WHAT'S HAPPENING WHICH IS EASY TO DO BECAUSE IT'S REFLECTS IVE WE DON'T NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT BALANCE FOR THE BALANCE TO BE H PENING BUT WE HAVE TO REENGAGE THOSE CIRCUITS ANTICIPATE FUTURE CONSEQUENCES THINK THROUGH THE DRINK YOU KNOW NOT JUST HOW MY GONG TO FEEL NOW IF I USE BUT HOW MI CAN FEEL TOMORROW OR SIX MONTHS FROM NOW AND THAT TELLING THE TRUTH IS IN FACT AWAY TO DO THAT TO MAKE THESE CONNECTIONS STRONGER AND THERE I TALK ABOUT SOME STUDIES IN MY BOOK THAT THAT KIND OF INDIRECTLY SHOW THAT SO I FIND THAT REALLY FASTENING PLUS DAT THEY JUST THAT LIKE BEING OPEN AND HONEST WITH PEOPLE REALLY DOES CREATE VERY INTIMATE CONNECTIONS AND THOSE INTIMATE CONNECTIONS CREATE OPENING SO WE ARE TALKING LITLE BIT ABOUT HOW YOU YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT TO PEOPLE WHO NEED LIKE INTENSITY IN THEIR LIVES FOR ME I NEED A LOT OF INTENSITY IN MY HUMAN CONNECTIONS LIKE I'M REALLY NOT INTERESTED IN AND BORED BY AND MADE ANXIOUS BY I'M CASUAL AM INNERACTIONS BUT YOU KNOW LIKE HAVING THIS KIND OF DISCUSSION WITH YOU THAT'S VERY INTENSE AND ALSO INTIMATE AND SELF DISCLOSING IS VERY REWARDING FOR ME SO THAT'S A IMPORTANT SOURCE OF DOIN THANK GOD I BECAME A PSYCHIITRON I APSOLRI I I CAN'T DIS OS ALL MY STUFF BUT I AM QUITE TRANSSPARENT WITH MY PATIENTS WHICH IS A SLIGHTLY ON ORTHYDOKS I'M BUT YOU KNOW WHEN I THINK IT'S RIGHT I'M ALSO TRANSPARENT WITH THEM SO THAT THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S A SOURCE OF DOPENING TO WHEN WE'RE HONEST AND WE DISCLOSE AND THAT YOU THINK PEOPLE ARE GOING TO RUN AWAY FROM YOU IF YOU TELL THEM ABOUT ALL LIKE YOUR WEIRD NAUROSIES BUT REALLY THEY DON'T WUT THEYRE LIKE IS OLL THINK GOD I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE RAY WELL WHAT I LOVE ABOUT I LOVE MANY THINGS ABOUT YOUR BOOK I READ IT IN ONE SWEET AND AND ELSE LIKE WOW IS IM I WAS A SURPLEASANTLY SURPRISE BUT I WAS LIKE WOT SHE'S REALLY OPENING UP IN THIS LOOK FROM THE VERY BEGINIT IM AND I DON'T ANT TO GIVE AT THAT AWAY BUT IT'S YET YOUR YOUR VERY OPEN I WHERE IT'S UPPROPRIATE AND IM AND ALSO I THINK THAT THIS QUESTION ABOUT TRUTH TELLING I I WAYS TING ABOUT LIKE TELL THE TRUTH THE YOU KNOW A HUNDRE PER CENT ABOUT THE TRUTH BUT THERE'S ALSO THES ELLEMENT ABOUT DO YOU REPORT PREVIOUS LIES RIGHT WHAT ABOUT PRIOR BEHAVAN AN I'M FASTENING BY THIS CUS TO ME TELLING THE TRUTH IS HAS MANY FASCITS BUT THAT THE THREE SIDES OF THIS THING OT IN MY MIND ARE ONE IS REPORTING EVERYTHING ACCURATELY THE OTHER IS WHAT YOU WITH HOLD WHAT YOU NOT WITHHOLD RIGHT BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE SAY I'M TELL THE TRUTH OR AT LEAST DON'T LINE THAT SORT OF I LIES OF  LIES OF OMISSION AS I HAES OF AMISSION I LIES OF AMISSION AND THEN THERE THERE'S THE WHAT I HAVE TO ASSUME FOR MOST PEOPLE IS A SMALL TO ENORMOUS BATCH OF THINGS THAT THEY LIED ABOUT IN THE PAST THAT STILL THREAD INTO THE FEW RAR SO HOW IMPORTANT IS IT FOR THAT THE ADDICT OR THAT EVERY PERSON RAY TO IM CAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE CULTIVATING THE CIRCUITORY BETWEEN PRO ONTLE QORTECTS IN THE DOPEMANS IS TOM OUL BE GREAT FOR ANYBODY UM SINCE WERE ALL ATICS RIGHT AS WE WANT YOU DO IT BUT IN IN ALL SERIOUSNESS IT SONS A A GOOD THING FOR EVERYBODY TO DO HOW UM HOW MUCH WORK MEEDS TO BE DONE ON ALL THE PRIORS ALL THE STUFF WE'VE HIDDENAN UM I MEU NOT ME BUT ALL THAT ALL THE STUFFS AT EVERYBODY AAAAYES SO THE YOU KNOW THE STEPS OF THE TWELVE STEPS OF ALCOHOLICANONOMIS UM A GOOD NUMBER OF THOSE STEPS ARE ABOUT THAT VERY THING THE PAST THE WAYS THAT WE'VE HARMED PEOPLE IN THE PAST AND ONE O THE FOURTH STEP IS ABOUT MAKING AMENDS UM YOU KNOW BY ADMITTING THE WAYS IN WHICH THAT WE'VE CONTRIBUTED UM TO HARMING OTHERS UM AND IT IS A REALLY BIG PIECE OF RECOVERY SO YOU KNOW HOW IMPORTANT SO SO FOR PEOPLE WITH EDICTION IT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT TO GO BACK AND MAKE AMENDS AND YOU KNOW YOU THETHE THE KEY IDEA THERE IS YOU JUST GO BACK IN YOU APOLOGIZE YOU KNOW AND YOU DON'T YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET ANY PATICULAR KIND OF RESPONSE OR YOU DON'T NEED TO BE FORGIVEN IT'S THE ACT ITSELF OF APOLOGIZING ABOUT THE WAYS IN WHICH WE'VE HARMED OR LIED TO PEOPLE O IN THE PAST THAT IS CATHARTIC AND RENEWING AND ALLOWS US TO KIND OF SHED THIS SKIN AND BE BE NEW IN OUR LIVES AND BEGIN AGAIN SORT OF ABSOLVED UM YOU KNOW OF PAST SIN SO TO SPEAK UM SO IT SO IT IS REALLY IMPORTANCE UM YOU KNOW ARE THEIR SITUATIONS WHEN IT'S MAY BE NOT A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE OF AND THAT PERSON OR THE NATURE SURE YOU KNOW THERE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE LIKE IT'S NOT WHERE TUNG AMOUT NOT LIKE NOT LIKE CONTS IDEA ABOUT IT NEVER LIVE UT AN ROBBERS IN YOUR HOUSE AND YOU OUN YOUR STO AWAY YOU CAN'T LIE EVEN ABOUT THAT'LIKE NOW THEREARE PROBABLY SITUATIONS ORATION YOU KNOW I FORSAKE OF OTHER PEOPLE SAV RIGHT IONES RIGHT RIGHT REGTONMING THERE THERE YOU CAN THINK OF A MILLION SAND AREOS BUT UM BUT BUT IN GENERAL YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE TAKING STOCK BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I HAVE A LOT OF REGRETS AND GUILT ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS IN MY LIFE AND AND UM AND THE KIND OF HAUNT ME YOU KNOW IT SMENS I'LL HAVE NIGHTMARES RIGHT UM AND I THINK THAT'S TRUE FOR MOST PEOPLE AND N I OCCASION WILL MEET SOMEBODY WAS LIKE LI DON'T HAVE ANY REGRETS AN I LIKE WAW LIKE I I CANNOT RELATE TO THAT AT AT ALL UM SO YOU KNOW THI IDEA OF LIKE CATHARSIS AND WELL I MEAN IN THE TWELVE STEPS IT'S TELLING TELLING GOD OR YOUR HIGER POWER TELLING ANOTHER HUMAN BEING THE WAYS IN WHICH YOU'VE WRONGED OTHERS CONSIDERING YOUR OWN CHARACTER DEFECTS AND HOW THOSE HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO ME THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE AND SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T DO ENOUGH IN OUR CURRENT CULTURE ESPECIALLY IN PSYCHIETRY FRANKLY WHERE THERE'S A LIKE A LOT OF ETERNALLY EM EMPATHIZING WITH PATIENCE BUT NOT A WHOLE LOT OF LIKE S GOING WELL YOU KNOW ACTUALLY YOU KIND OF MESS TH AT UP WORLIKE THAT WAS REALLY BAD ON YOU YOU KNOW AND ID IN MY WORK I DON' NE SERELY USE THAT LANGUAGE MET YOU KNOW  PATIENCE MANSY LIFE I I REALLY FEEL BADLY ABOUT YOU KNOW THIS THING O B LIKE YE I GET IT I I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU FEEL GUILTAS IT IS ARIGHT THERE'S A CIRCUIT FOR THAT TO RIGHT AND ILS IT'S IMPORTANT RIGHT AND IT'S ALL SO IMPORTANT TO IM RECOVERY AND TO NOT BECOMING ADDICTED A YOU KNOW EXPERIENCING A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF APPROPRIATE SHAME FOR THINGS THAT WE HAVE DONE AND YOU KNO FEELING F THE PAIN TAT COMES WITH SHAME WHICH IS AN INCREDIBLY PAINFUL EMOTION RIGHT AND I THINK THAT MAY BE THE ONE THAT WE ALL TRY TO AVOID MORE THAN ANY OTHER IS LIKE THAT SHAME U OF NOT BEING LIKED OR NOT BEING ACCEPTED OR NOT BEING WORS ALATHENA WE DID IS IS REALLY DESPICABLE RIGHT IT'S O REALLY YEL LIKE ALL MI GOTI  THAT HORRIBLE THING RIGHT RIGT AND THEN SO I MEAN IE DONE HORRIBLE THINGS THAT I I HAVEN'T GONE BACK AND SAID I DID THIS HORRIBLE THING BUT IM MAYBE I'VE TRIED TO PAY IT FORWARD LIKE I'VE TOLD MY KIDS YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I DID THIS HORRIBLE THING AND IT STILL HAUNTS ME SO IF YOU'RE EVER TEMPTED TO DO SOMETHING LIKE WHAT I DID YOU MIGHT THINK ABOUT MY SITUATE SO YOU KNOW SOME KIND OF WAY NOW BUT I THINK RESTLING WITH THAT IS IS IMPORTANT I I THINK IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT ELEMENT ALL THIS AND THERE'S NOT A I LOVE THAT THERE'S NARROW SCIENCE BEING DONE ON TRUTH TELL WE AD VALUYE OF TRUTH TO YAD I THINK A IT IF I WERE TO PREDICT IT A NEW AND TRULY EXCITING AREA THAT PEOPLE ARE YOU MAY REALLY CURIOUS ABOUT AND UM IN THIS HUGE SPHERE WE CALL NARROW SCIENCE I I HOPE THEY'LL CONTINUED YOU MORE WE HA AL SO SPEAKS I'M SO GLAD OORE THAT'S HAPPENING HERE AT STAMFOR I KNOW THAT'S THAT THAT THE WA THE THE THE LITERATURE THAT I LOOK AT ISN'T TO STANDFORD WORK BUT DUM BUT THERE'S WORK IT RE MIGHT BE MIHT BE PEOPLEAVER GARLES A WORD DONING YET A MORE OF THAT AND ALL THE REST YELLES IUM ON'T ASK YOU ABOUT USING DRUGS TO TREAT DRUG ADICTION M THESE DAYS THERE'S A GROWING INTEREST OR AT LEAST DISCUSSION ABOUT I BEGAIN PEOPLE GOING DOWN AT GOING OUT OF COUNTRY BECAUSE I THINK IT STILLY LEGAL HERE I MORE ISY LEGAL HERE GOING OUT OF COUNTRY TO AN EITHER IM INJECTED OR SMOKE IT OR WHATEVER IT IS OR PEOPLE GOING AND DOING I WASK A JOURNEYS OR I'M EMPTY A MAY WHICH IS STILL ANY LEGAL DRUG IN THIS COUNTRY BUT THERE CLINICAL TRIALS THERE ARE PEOPLE ON THIS CAMP IS DOING EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES I DON'T KNOW OF CLINICAL TRIALS BUT IT JOHNS HOPKINS THERE CLENICAL TRIALS ET CETERA SO THIS IM THIS IS A VAST AREA RIGHT DIFFERENT CHEMISTRIES FOR DIFFERENT DRUGS AND DIFFERENT PURPOSES BUT THE THE RATIONAL AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS TAKE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN A PATTERN OF EDICTION LAUNCH THEM IN TO A EXPERIENCE THAT'S ALSO CHEMICAL AND EXTREME OFTEN OF THE EXTREME CERATONEEN AND OR EXTREME DOPAMEN TYPE SO EMPTY A MAN RAC TASY FRENDS NHUNS OF CER TONEAND DOMPN TONS OF DOPENING DUMP HOW NEROTOXIC IF NEROTALKIC DEBATABLE ET CETERATE CETER NOT THE TOPIC FOR NOW BUT A LOT AND THEN SOMEHOW THAT EXTREME EXPERIENCE RAPPED INSIDE OF A O A SUPPORTED NETWORKIN THERE WHETHER NOT THERE'S JUST SOMEONE THERE OR WHETHER NOT THEY'R ACTIVELY WORKING THROUGH SOMETHING THE PATIENT IS SUPPOSED TO EJECT THE PERSON INTO A LIFE WHERE DRUG USE ISN'T NOT AS MUCH OF INTEREST THIS VIOLATES AT T AT  AT A RASH PURELY RATIONAL LEVEL THIS VIOLATES EVERYTHING WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF DOPENME BIOLOGY IT WOULD IF THIS ARRANGEMENT IS THE WAY I DESCRIBED IT CAUSE MORE ADICTION IS ANYTHING BUT A DOPENING FAST ITS A DOPEMIN FEASTSO WE HEREABOUT SUCCESSFUL TRANSITIONS THROUGH THIS AT LEAST ANEDOTELYAN MA NOM MAY BE SOMECLINSITE WHAT SNEON WHAT I  O AS A MANY S TANUS TOMEN YA YE YA SO I THINK IT'S GOOD THAT YOUR SCEPTICAL AM I THINK WE ALL SHOULD BE SCEPTICAL HAVING SAID THAT AM THERE ARE CLINICAL STUDIES SHOWING AM YOU KNOW N THESE ARE SMALL STUDIES IN THEIR SHORT DURATION SMALL NUMBER OF SUBJECTS BUT YOUR TAKING PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE WHO ARE ADDICTED TO ALCOHOL AND THEN HAVING THEM HAVE THIS ETLESS A PSYCHODELIC EXPERIENCE IN A VERY CONTROLLED SATINGS RHATHER TYPICALATES A HIH DO SILICIDE AN OR OR THREE DOSE AS I SIUDT IT FOR THE MAPSTUDY OF OF MD MA RATASY THOSE AR SORT OF THE THE ANTO BE THE KIN OF TYPICAL I RA RED IN BUTTER OF RIGHT KIND OF RIGHT BUT THE THINK TO REALLY KEEP IN MIND IS THAT THIS IS COMPLETELY INTERWOVEN WITH REGULAR PSYCHOTHERAPY AND THAT THESE ARE HIGHLY SELECTED INDIVIDUAL AND CLINICAL TRIALS R RAGIN AS ARE A  LEGUOCLAND RIGT RIGT AND AND AND SO YOU KNOW I WON'T I THINK THE METAPHOR THAT I THAT THAT HELPS ME THINK ABOUT THIS IS THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN AND THESE ARE SORT O LIKE TAKING THE GONDOLA INSTEAD OF WALKING UP ITS SORT OF INSTEAD OF DOING LIKE A YEAR OF PSYCHO ANALYSIS WHERE YOUR SITTING ON THE COUCH EVERY WEEK REFLECTING ON YOUR LIFE IT'S A CONDENSED VERSION OF PSYCHO ANALYSIS OR PSYCO THERE BE PLUS YOU KNOW MD MA WHICH GETS YOU THERE FAST CREMES THE INTIMACY PRESUMABLY RECKISNUSS I THINK THE MEAIN THING THAT HAPPENS WHEN IT'S BENEFICIAL IS IT JUST ALLOWS THE PERSON TO GET OUTSIDE OF THEIR OWN HEAD AND LOOK AT THERE LIVES ON A MUCH BROADER SWEEP AND TO CONSIDER THEMSELVES NOT MIRED IN THE YOU KNOW QUOTIDIAN SORT OF DETAILS OF THEIR LIFE BUT RATHER AS A HUMAN ON ON THE LARGE PLANET EARTH IN THE VAST UNIVERSE SO I THINK IT TAKES IT IT'S LIKE WHEN IT WORKS IT'S A TRANSFORMATIONAL EXPERIENCE BECAUSE IT GIVES THE PERSON ANOTHER HO LENDS THROUGH WHICH TO VIEW THEIR LIVE THEIR LIVES WHICH WHICH I THINK FOR SOME PEOPLE IS POSITIVE AND POWERFUL BECAUSE THEY CAN COME BACK FROM THAT IN BE LIKE OH MYGOSH I CARE ABOUT MY FAMILY AND I DON'T I WANT EXQUIRES FOR THEM AND I REALIZE THAT MY CONTINUING TO DRINK IS NOT GOING TO YOU KNOW ACHIEVE THAT SO IT'S IT'S ALMOST LIKE A SPIRITUAL OR VALUES BASED SO I THINK IT CAN BE VERY POWERFUL BUT BUT HAVING SAID THAT I TRULY AM QUITE SCEPTICAL BECAUSE YOU KNOW A DICTION IS A CHRONIC RELAPSING AND REMITTING PROBLEM IT'S HARD FOR ME TO IMAGINE THAT THEIRE'S SOMETHING THAT WORKS VERY QUICKLY SHORT TERM THAT'S GOON TO WORK FOR A DISEASE THAT'S REALLY LONG LASTING YET THE TWO ATICS I KNOW THAT THAT DID EMDY IN IT EMPDY A MANASISTED PSYCHOTHERAPEIS FARD AS PART OF THIS O THING BOTH GOT WORSE YE UM BUT THE PEOPLE I KNOW WHO HAD SEVERE TRAMA WHO DID THIS WHO TOOK THIS APPROACH SEEM TO BE DOING BETTER  AND SO I UM I THINK THAT  THE DISCUSSION AS WE HEAR IT NOW IS JA SORT OF PSYCHODELICS WHICH IS A HUGE CATEGORY A RIGT THAT INCLUDES MANY DIFFERENT DRUGS AN COMPOUNDS AN DIFFERENT EFFECTS AND WE HEARABOUT TROMAN AND DICTION LUMP TOGETHER AND I THINK THAT AM IMA SPLITTER NOT A LUMPERN AS WE SAY IN SCIENCE NOM A AND I THINK IT'S CAN O BE IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT THIS IS DEFONLY NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL KIND OF THING BUT IT'S SELSELIKE IT MAY HAVE SOME UTILITY UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS YE I THINK SO  THINK II'M TRYING TO BE VERY OPEN MINDED ABOUT ITS POTENTIAL UTILITY FOR CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS BUT I CAN TELL YOU IN MY CLINICAL WORK WHAT IS VERY CONCERNING A UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF THIS NARRATIVE IS I HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR SOME KIND OF SPIRITUAL AWAKENING WHO ON THEIR OWN NOT IN THE CONTEXT OF ANY KIND OF THERAPEUTIC PSYCHO LOGICAL WORK YOU KNOW MYCRODOSE OR WANT A TRY INO SYLICITHEN OR EMPDY A MAY WITH A FRIEND OR WHEREVER SO THEY CAN HAVE THE UNAL SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE THAT THEY CAN FIGURE OUT THEIR LIVES THAT THAT'S A DISASTER AND AN ALMOST NEVER WORKS OUT WHILE AND I THEN HAD PEOPLE WHO LITERALLY  SUPPOSEG YOU CAN'T GET ADDICTED TO PSYCHODELICS BECAUSE YOU KNOW SOMETHING WITH THE BI CHEMISTRY WHICH I DON'T FULLY OCHANKS THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME BUT I HAVE PATIENTS CLENDIRLY WHO DEFINITELY ARE ADDICTED TO OUKNOW EMDYAMAY TO MYCRODOSING SO THAT'S VERY CONCERNING TO ME CAUSE LIKE YOU KNOW POLENS HOW TO CHANGE YOUR MIND THAT THAT YOU KNOW I I RESPECT THAT WORK BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IT'S PENETRATED THE CONTER ALEN'S BOOK YET YEN AN ANI DON'T KNOWEM AND SO IM I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM TAKEN IT TAKEN A STANCE M SO A'LL TO SAY MY STANCE ON THAT IS THE NARRATIVE OF POPULAR AUTHORS CAN EXPAND AND WICKOUT SO FAST YES THAT PRETTY SOON PEOPLE ARE ESSENTIALLY TAKING THEIR MENTAL HEALTH AN TO THEIR OWN HANDS AND  I ACTUALLY F I HAVE GREAT OPTIMISM FOR THIS A BUSINESS OF OF CLINICL USE OF IM PSYCHODELICS INCLUDING M D M A MATTHEW JOHNSON AT JOHNS HOPKINS IS DOING FABULOUS WORK ON THIS UM AND AND THERE ARE OTHERS TOO OF COURSE BUT THOSE ARE CONTROLLED SETINGS RAND THE PHARMACOLOGY IS BEING TUNED UP AND ONE THING THAT I THINK IS COMING I THE'RE SEVERAL PAPERS PUBLISH RECENTLY AN GREAT JOURNALS LIKE NATURE AND SCIENCE ET CETERA WHERE THERE ARE SCIENTISTS WHO ARE REMOVING THE HALLUCINA JENIC COMPONENTS OF THESE DRUGS  AND FINDING THAT THEY STILL HAVE THE ANTIDEPRESSENT EFFACTS AND SO THE EXPERIENCE OF A PSYCHODELIC AND THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF THE PSYCHODELIC MIGHT ACTUALLY BE DISSOCO AND SO I GAIN IA AND I'M ALWAYS CAREFURTAL SAY I I'M NEITHER FOR SOMETHING OR AGAINST IT I I JUST THINK THAT IM TREADING CAREFULLY IS WHAT'S IMPORTANT I I I AGREE WITH YOU AND I CAN JUST TELL YOU THAT THE THE DOWNSTREAM OF FACTS FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON IM I'D FR MANY OF WHOM PRESENT IN OUR CLINIC IS THAT THEY'VE MISCONSTRUED THE DATA ON THE USE OF PCSYCHODELICS FOR MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS I'M TO THIS IDEA THAT THEY'RE SAY FOR THAT ANYBODY CAN TAKE THEM ANY CIRCUMSTANCE AND HAVE THIS KIND OF AWAKENING AND INTHAT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE DATA SHALL WRITE THE DATE ARE THESE HIGHLY CONTROLLED SETTINGS IM YOU SAID CAREFULLY SELECTED PATIENTE O THAT THAT'S MY WORK YOU KNOW SURE AND AMUMINBE SITTING DOWN WITH MATTHEW JOHNSON AND AT SOME POINT AND WILL DISCUSS THIS AND I THINK THAT A THAT CARE AND THAT I THAT CACOON OF OF REAL CLINICAL CARE DOES SEEM TO BE AN IMPORTANT WEAVE ON IT II'M GLAD WE COULD TOUCH ON IT AND DEM AT YOU KNOW I'MSHUREI'LL GET A BUNCH OF COMMENTS TELL ME BUT U I BUT I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO EXPLORE THINGS FROM ALL SIDES AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE WE DO AS YECIENTISAN IF MICHAEL PALM WANTS TO CHAT WE CAN DO THAT TOO MTHAT'S MYI RE VERY MUCH ENJOYED THE BOOK ACTUALLY UM BUT I THINK THAT A PEOPLE RUN WITH IDEAS THAT'S RIGHT THEY DON'T WALK WITH THEM THAT HE SARENT RAM THE'RE COUPLE OTHER THINGS I JUST WON AT TOUCH ON IM BUT THEY ALL RELATE TO SOCIAL MEDIA HO YOU WERE FEATURED IN THE SOCIAL DOLEMA I'S A POWERFUL MOVY I THINK MANY PEOPLE AVOIDED SEEING THAT MOVY BECAUSE IT IT REFLECTS BACK ON US JUST HOW ADDICTED WE ALL ARE AND HOW MANIPULATED WE ALL ARE YES BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO CHANGED BEHAVIOR MUCH I HAVE TO SAY THAT THAT THE MOVY CHANGED MY UNDERSTANDING IN MY PERCEPTION BUT NOT MY BEHAVIO R TOO MUCH IF WE LOOK AT ADDICTION AS A MALADAPT O THINK SOMETHING THAT'S MAKING OUR LIVES WERE SOR AR ARE US LESS FUNCTIONAL AT WORK AN IN RELATIONSHIPS I COULD IMAGIN AVERSION OF SOCIAL MEDIA WARE IT'S MAKING ME MORE CONNECTED I MEAN THIS IS A POD CAST AFTER WEET I POS YES BE THE AUSE AT THIS WILL SHOW UP ON ME TO AND M AND ELEMENTS OF IT ON INSTROGRAMAS WELL SO MUCH LIKE O SUGAR OR OM OTHER THINGS I HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT WE NEED TO REGULATE NOT NECESSARILY ELIMINATE THIS BEHAVIOR SO ONCE O ABAT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE REFERRED TO AS THIS NARCICISTIC PREOCCUPATION THAT SOCIAL MEDIAS CREATING THAT WE ARE ALL FAR MORE KEENLY AWARE OF HOW WE LOOK AND HOW WE SOUND AND HOW WE ARE BEING PERCEIVED THAN WE WERE TEN YEARS AGO RIGHT SO FIRST ALL SOCIAL MEDIA IM HOW ADDICTING IS IT REALLY AND WHAT IS HEALTHY SOCIAL MEDIA BEHAVIOR SO THE FIRST MESSAGE I WOULD WANT TO GET ACROSS ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA IS THAT IT REALLY IS A DRUG AND IT'S ENGINEER TO BE A DRUG IM AND ITS SPACED ON YOU KNOW PODENCY QUANTITY VARIETY UM THE BOTTOMLESS POLLS THE LIKES THE WAY THAT IT'S ENUMERATED ALL OF THAT WHICH DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN'T USE IT UM BUT WE NEED TO BE VERY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THE WAY WE WE USE IT JUST LIKE WE NEED TO BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THE WAY WE USE ANY DRUG IM AND SO THAT MEANS WITH INTENTION AND IN ADVANCE PLANNING OR USE RIGHT AND TRYING TO USE IT IN AS AS A AS A REALLY AWSOME TOOL TO POTENTIALLY CONNACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND NOT TO BE USED BY IT U'M OR GET LOST IN IT AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE GOING TO COME WITH DIFFERENT PROPENSITIES FOR ADDICTION TO ANY DRUG AND THAT'S TRUE FOR SOCIAL MEDIA TO SOME PEOPLE WILL HAVE NO PROBLEM USING IT IN MODERATION OR USING IT IN A WAY THAT'S ADAPTIVE AND OTHER OTHER PEOPLE WELL IMMEDIATELY GET GET SUCKED IN AND THE KEYTHING ABOUT GETTING ANDICTED AS WHEN IT'S HAPPENING WET WE NOBODY WHO'S GETTING ANDICTID THINKS THEY'RE ETTING A DICT AT RIGHT LET'S FACE IT IT'S ONLY AFTER THE FACT THAT WE GO WHAPS YO KNOW WHAT WAS THAT I I'LL REMEMBER TEXING AND DRIVING THERE ALL THESE BOOKS ABOUT TEXING A DRIVING OW TERRIBLE WAS YE EVEN THE GOVERNMENTS HAVE LARGELY GIVEN UP YOU SEE THESE YOU HAVE BILBOAR TERRIFI DON'T TEXAN DRAVER ANY TEX CAN ANTER NOT WORTH DYING FOR IGHT ER ANYBODY'S TEXLEND RIGHT AND IF YOU LOOK AT YOUNG PEOPLE DEYTEEN EATERS I MEAN THEIR BASICALLY CIBURNATICALLY ENHANCE THAT THE PHONE IS THERE YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE THEIR TALKING TO YOU AND TEXTING TWELVE FRIENDS AT THE SAME TIME AND THERE'S NO STOPPING AND I MEAN THE GENIE IS AT OF THE BOTTLE WHERE YOU KNOWIT'S NOT NOT GOING BACK RIGHT NOW SO WE WE DO NEED TO FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW HOW TO MAKE THIS THIS TOOL SOMETHING THAT'S YOU'RE GING TO BE GOOD FOR US AND AND NOT ALTERNATELY HARMFUL AND I I DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS AT BY ANY STRATCH OF THE IMAGINATION BUT I DO THINK YOU KNOW SOME OF THE WISDOM THAT WE HAVE LEARNED FROM USING OTHER DRUGS ALSO APPLIES TO SOCIAL MEDIA WHICH IS TO SAY THAT WE HAVE TO AGAIN PUT BARRIERS IN PLACE THAT ALLOW US TO REMAIN IN CONTROL OF OUR USE WHICH MEANS NOT NOT TOO MUCH YOU KNOW NOT TOO OFTEN NOT TOO POTENT IM DOYOU THINK IN  GOING BACK TO THIS IDEA OF THAT THE UNIT OF THE DAY BEING A GOOD ATTRACTABLE UNIT A MANAGEABLE UNIT OF TIME FOR MOST PEOPLE I'M SO YOURE SAYING IN ADVANCE OR ALLICAVING TO HOURS IN WHICH YOU'RE GOING TO ALLOW YOURSELF TO HAVE FRE RAIN USE OF THE PHONE AN ALL ITS APS IN LLS THINGS OR 'M EVEN MORE RESTRICTED THAN THAT MEANING I CAM I'M ONLY CAN ALLOW MYSELF THIRTY MINUTES A DAY TO POST IN COMMENT AND THEN THAT'S A CLOSE OUT COMPLETELY YES SO I THINK IT'S IT'S DEPENDS ON THE PERSON AND SORT OF A COMMONATION WE TALKED OUR TLERE ABOUT YOU KNOW HAVING AN ITCH AND SCRATCHING YOURSELF AT NIGHT WE'VE GOT INTO APPOINT WITH SMARTPHONES PEOPLE ARE PULLING THEM OUT AND THEY ARE UTTERLY UNCONSCIOUS OF DOING SO PULLING HEM OUT YOU KNOW COUPLE TAXTS TO COUPLESI THI DON'T KNI O TORANG ANGY WHO  WORKS IN THADOES DELIVERS BABIES YET AND I'M MANY PREGNANT MOTHERS WON'T ACTUALLY DELIVER WITHOUT THEIR PHONE IN HAND AND THIS USE TO BE THE HAND THAT WAS ACTED TO THEIR I BE A COMMONTOAN Y HOUSES AA MORE THAN NON PHONE AM BUT I IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S IT'S A KIND OF A SECURITY BLIND IS ON A TRANSITIONAL OBJECT YE ACTUALLY NEVER REMINDS ME YOU'VE REFERRED TO I'M THE PHONE I THINK IT'S THE PHONE BUT MAYBE IT'S OUR ONLINE PERSONA OR OUR SELVES AS WE'VE BECOME SORT OF INFANTILE IN OUR NEED FOR IT LIKE A BABY IN A BOTTLE R ND SO I DO WONDER IF IF WE HAVE A REGRESS AND I DO THINK WE'VE REGRESS A BIT I'M IN TERMS OF OUR ONLINE BEHAVIOR OUR INABILITY TO CONACT LIKE YE I'VE SOUHT IN ADULT WAS SOMEBOLY THE CONCCONTROL THEIR BEHAVIYOU HAVE US A DIFFERENT E DIN A BABY IN A NONE YOU HAVE TO BE IN WELL NELL NOR ABOUT IS FROM ONT UNDERSON A YOUNG ORGANISM CAN'T CONTROL ITS BEHAVIOR AN OLDER ONE CAN SO TO ME I A MATURE ORGANISM MATURE IN YEARS ORGANISM THAT CAN'T CONTROL TS BEHAVIOR IS A BABY IT'SN IT'S IN IMMATUREERAN O ITSELF AND THERE'S NOOL THERE'S NO SCIENCE TO SUPPORT THAT STATEMENT I'M I LOOK IN MY OWN BEHAVIOR WITH THE PHONE SOMETIMES AND I THINK I'M A GROANE MAN  I NO WAN IS THE ROLEM HERE I AM YOU KNIT ONLY BABY FOOD BUT I'M ACTING LIKE A BABY WE A PHONE I I'M IN THE SENSE THAT I'M REFLECTIVELY PICKING IT UM I'M I'M NOT BEING INTENTION IN DELIBERATEWOUL I I'M DOI NEED A FUL THIRTY DAYS SO ET THAT'S OTHERDA I OW THAT'S MYRI FALL THIRTY DAYS TO RESETERAL I T YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE SEVERELY ADDICTED THAT THA I RECOMMEN THE THREE DAYS BUT IF YOU'RE JUST A LITTLE BIT ADDICTED LIKE MOST OF US YOU PROBALLY DON'T NEED THIRTY DAYS IN FACT A SINGLE DAY NOT ONLY WOULD BE CHALLENGING BUT M BUT PROBABLY MAYBE SUFFICIENT MY PHONE IS OFF FOR SUBSTANTIAL SIDEMENTSON O CAN'T THAT'S CRAT AND IT DRIVES OTHER PEOPLE CRAZY PEOPLE EXPECT ME TO RESPOND A BUT I DON'T CARE EWO RIGHT AND CTUALLY TAKE A LITL BIT OF PLEASURE YE IN THATAWELL BECAUSE I THINK THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE IS THE RIGHT ONE WHICH IS THAT IS NOT JUST RIGHT FOR ME BUT LIKE WHY AD IT I DON'T SEE A CLAUS ON TEXT MESSAGES OR EMALES THAT SAY MUST BE RESPONDED TO WITH IN I EX AMOUNT OF TIME OR ELSE SITS IM OR ELSE WE ESO I TAKE THE LIBERTY OF THE REPLINE WHEN I WHEN I'M ABLE TO YE THAT 'S RIGHT WENT WANT TOYET WI  RIGHT WHICH TOUCHES ON ONE OF THE BIG CHALLENGES ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA IS THAT AS MORE AND MORE OF US ARE SPENDING MORE AND MORE TIME ON SOCIAL MEDIA WERE DIVESTING OUR LABIDINESS ENERGIES ET CETERA FROM REAL LIFE INTERACTIONS SO THAT MEANS EVEN WHEN WE WANT TO CHOOSE TO NOT BE ON MINE CONNECTING WE GO OUTSIDE AND THERE'S THERE'S NO THERE THERE RIGHT THERE'S NOBODY ELSE THERE SO I THINK OUR COLLECTIVE CHALLENGE AND IT SHOULD BE OUR MISSION IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PRESERVING AND MAINTAINING OFF LINE WAYS TO CONNECT WITH EACH OTHER CAUSE IF WIF WE DON'T DO THAT THEN WILL BE VERY LONELY RIGHT IF WE WERE NOT ON MINE BUT IF YOU HAVE A TRIBE OF FOLKS THAT YOU CAN BE WITH NONE OF WHOM ARE ON THEIR FHONES WHILE YOU'RE TOGETHER FOR THAT DISCREET AMOUNT AF TIME THEN IT'S WONDERFUL AND LIBERATING AN NOBODY'S DISTRACTED AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY THE KEY AND I THINK YOUNG PEOPLE ARE FIGURING THAT OUT YOU KNOW THEY'RE TRYING TO CREATE THESE SPACES OR TRYTA LET'S SAY INSTEAD OF DOING IT DON'T MEAN FAST BY YOURSELF DO IT WITH YOUR FRIENDS RIGHT THEN THERE'S THAT PHOMO IS LESS THE FEAR OF MISSING OUT BECAUSE O YOU'RE ALL DOING THE DON' MEAN FAST TOGETHER SO THESE EARE SOME OF THE TRICKS THAT IN A WECAN COME UP WITH BUT A LIKE THAT YECAN LI  I DON'T ALLOW I HAVE A HOME GIM AND I I LOVE WORKING OUT II JUST ENJOY IT AND ALWAYS HAVE AND I I DON'T ALLOW MY PHONE YEN MY GIM ANY MORE IGHT AND I LIVEIN AN ARY WHERE I DON'T GET ANY RECEPTION LIKE TWO METERS OUTSIDE MY RAR SO ALL MY DOG WALKS NOW OR JUST I THEY WERE BORING AS HO ELL HAVE TE DOG HE DOES LIKE TO WHAT IS REA ES LOV O AND IT WAS SO BORING FOR A WHILE YES CAUSE I WAS SO USED TO TAKIN CALLS RA WALKENS  SUPERFICIENT YAN I DO THAT THE WALKS NOUR SOME OF MY FAVOURITE PART OF THE YEI RA AND IF THE PHONE WERE IF I WERE TO GET A CALL ON ONE OF THOSE IN TOR CEPTION F THE AIR YES I'D BE VERY ASSIMADE RA I CAN ATTEST TO THIS AND IM I DON'T THINK I'M A PHONE ATTIC UM BU UT I DO PUT WORK INTO REGULATING MY YES O THIS IS THE KEY YOU HAVE TO WITH INTENTION PRIOR TO BEING IN THAT SITUATION THINK OF LITERAL PHYSICAL AND METICOGNATIV BARRIERS THAT YOU CAN PUT BETWEEN YOURSELF AND YOUR PHONE OR WHATEVER YUR YOUR DRUG IS TO CREATE THESE INTENTIONAL SPACES WHERE YOU'RE NOT CONSTANTLY INTERRUPTING YOURSELF ESSENTIALLY AND DISTRACTING YOURSELF BECAUSE I REALLY DO THINK AN I THINK WE TALK JUST JUST BEFORE WE WE STARTED WITH THE INTERVIEW YOU KNOW WERE WE'RE LOSING THE ABILITY TO HAVE A SUSTAINED THOUGHT RIGHT AND M WE WE GET SO FAR AND THEN THEN YOU GET TO THAT POINT IN THE THOUGHT WHERE IT'S A LITTLE BIT HARD TO KNOW WHAT'S COMING NEXT AND IT'S VERY EASY TO CHECK YOURPHONE OR CHECK YOUR EMALE OR LOOK SOMETHING UP ON YOU KNOW THE INNER NET AND THEN YOU NEVER GET THAT OPPORTUNITY TO FINISH THAT THOUGHT WHICH IS REALLY THE SOURCE OF CREATIVE ENERGY AND AN ORIGINAL THOUGHT RIGHT YOU'RE OT JUST REACTING TO  AND SOMETHING A AN CONTRIBUTE TO THE WORLD THAT'S A AAM A BIG I MAY BE BELIEVER THAT YOUR EITHER CONSUMING OR YOU ARE CREATING R AN THER THERE'S I SHOULD MENTION A IT'S IMPORTANT I DO BELIEVE IN NEUTRAL TIME I THINK SLEEP IS CRATE I MON BE PROPONITIVEIN TALK ALOT ABOUT ON THE PARCASTIC CAROLOT ABOUT SLEEP AN NOT JUST FOR SAKE A PERFORMANCE I SHOAN'T JISREALLY LIKE SLEEP UM I THINK THAT BEING A CONSTANT CONSUMER OF VISUAL INFORMATION AND TH E INFORMATION OF ALL KINDS CAN CAN BE A PROM BUT BUT THERE'S SOME REALLY GREAT SOURCES OF INFORMATION ON THE NTERAND UM A AND I I CERTAINLY BENEFIT FROM FROM THE FACT THAT THAT THOSE CHANNELS EXIST UM NAR SOCISTIC PREOCCUPATION AM I ANARSISIS YOU KNOW I FORS FALL THERE THERE'S THERE'S HEALT OR AS E FAT IN I AAN IS THAT IAN TA NO O OUR SH IS NO AS THAT G O YES HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED IN OURSELVS AND NOTS ON ARMES OF THIS  SO THERE'S HEALTHY NOUR SISISM WHICH MEANS THAT WE ALL IN VEST ARE PERSONAL ENERGIES INTO THINGS THAT WE CARE ABOUT AND IF OUR COMPETENCE IN THAT ERENAS THREATENED WE WE WOULD ALL EXPERIENCE IN OUR SISTIC INJERY AND THAT'S NORMAL AND HEALTHY UM BUT BUT BUT WE ARE LIVING IN A NARCICISTIC CULTUREMING THAT'S NOT NEWS THIS PREOCCUPATION WITH INDIVIDUAL ACHIEVEMENT AND INDIVIDUAL SELF WERTH AND INDIVIDUAL SELF CONFIDENCE AND I THINK ALL OF THAT IS JUST FUELLED BY SOCIAL MEDIA WHERE WE'RE NOT JUST SEEING OURSELVES BHUT WERE SEEING PEOPLE'S REACTIONS TO OURSELVES IN EVERYTHING O YOU KNOW THING WE SAY OR DO YOU KNOW WE GET LIKES IN THIS IND THAT IT'S REALLY INSIDIOUS AND IT CONTRIBUTES I THINK ULTIMATELY TO A LOT OF PERSONAL SHAME BECAUSE WE'RE NOT REALLY MEANT TO BE INDIVIDUALS BOUNCING AROUND IN THE UNNIVERSE WORE SOCIAL ANIMALS AND WE WE'RE WE'RE PROBABLY GENERALLY HAPPIEST EVEN FOR NA TURAL CRONT CONTRARIANS AMONG US WHEN WE'RE PART OF A TRIBE RIGHT AND IF WE DO TOO MUCH TO KIND OF SEPARATE OURSELVES FROM FROM THAT TRIBE I THINK THAT THE BRAINS NATURAL AND INSTINCTIV CORRECTIVE MECHANISM AGAINST THAT IS SELF CLOTHING IN SHAME SO YOU KNOW IT'S SO IRONIC BECAUSE THAT THE CULTURE TELLS US IF WE JUST ACHIEVE MORE WE'LL LIKE OURSELVES MORE BUT THE TRUTH IS ACTUALLY THE OPPOSITE THAT THAT I THINK WHEN PEOPLE GET THESE PINNACLES OF PERSONAL ACHIEVEMENT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THINGS LIKE THE IMPOSTERS IN GOM OR WHAT WHATEVER N JUS YOU DON'T WE'RE AT STAMPERED AFTER A LOT OF HIGH ACHIEVERS YOUI RIGHT UMS  PHENOMENAL AMAZING PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELF AND O OTHER COLLEAGUE OF MON THAT JIS M ALWAYS IN AWE LIKE THIS SYSTAMAZING LIKE THE MEAN IT IS SHIFTED SO HIGHAND ALSO PEOPLE HAVE AMAZING STORKE PATHS TO GET HERE ON COMING FROM VERY LITTLE ACCOMPLISHING SO MUCH BUT IT'S ALSO THE PRESSURE YRIGHT AM YOU KNOW THE WAY THAT THIS CAREER WAS DESCRIBED TO ME THE DAY I GOT MY JOB WAS ONE COLLEAGUE OF MINE THE LATE BEN BARRISAID WELCOME TOSKIS A FRENDY AND  NEVER N O E OLY CONPLYANY OTING WITHOUT ETING INTERRUPT ID NOT O AS PARTIALLY TRUE OL I'VE CREATED BUFFERS AND THE OTHER ONE M VERY A SUCCESSFUL SCIGN DISN'T A MEMBER AN ASHRACABMY ET CETERA SAID TO ME YOU KNOW I JUST REMEMBER IT'S PINBALL YOU NEVER WHEN THE BEST YOU CAN DO IS JUST KENPLANE YES AND I THOUGHT I WAL O KE O KE AND THEN YOU JUST GO RIGHT BUT I THINK THAT AS WE ACHIEVE MORE NOT JUST ACODEMICS OF COURSE T AS ANY ONE ACHIEVES MORE THERE'S THE RELISHING IN THE ACCOMPLISHMENT THERE'S OFTEN THE DESIRE FOR MORE BUT THERE'S ALSO THE PRESSURE OF WELL NOW I HAVE TO DO THIS FOR THE NEXT THIRTY YEARS EVEN THOUGH I LOVE IT IT'S THE PRESSURE OFE WELL IF THE MOUNTAIN IS THIS HIGH THAN HOW DO I GET HERE AND HERE AND HERE AND THEN YOU START SHOVELING MORE DIRT ONS YOU CAN KEEP AHOMY AND IT'S A LOT OF WORK YES AND I THINK THAT THE UM THE PERCEPTION OF SUCCESS IS THAT THERE'S A ROAR OF THE CROWD AND YOU CRUISE YOU DON'T CRUISE IN THAT THEY JUST GIVE YOU MORE TO DO RIGHT OR YOU GIVE YOURSELF MORE TO DO WHAT I THINK IS AT LEAST IN MY MY LIFE EXPERIENCE I'VE HEARD THIS FROM OTHER PEOPLE AS WELL YOU KNOW IT WHAT IT'S THAT PRIZE THAT WERE GOING FOR THAT IF WE GET IT IT'S SO UNSATISFYING AND IT'S THE PRIZE THAT WE NEVER IMAGINED THAT WE CAN'T GO OHOW DID THAT HAPPEN BUT G YOU KNOW THAT FEELS GOOD AND SO I'M VERY I IT'S CURE WHAT'S THIT'S O MARAGE N YA S LIKE A IM LIKE A YET'S ON THE ONE IT'S ALMOST LAKE DOBLEMEAN CAN CREATE THESE MIRAGE YES THAT THERE'S SOM PLACE THAT AR RIGHT AND IF I GENT IT'S THAT POT OF GORIGT RIGHT BIT I TOBSTANT DYING RIGHT ATI'LL RIGHT AN THAT IS RIGHT KNOW AND AND I THINK THIS MENOR THIS REALLY I THINK IS RELATED TO OUR OUR TAUGHT OUR DISCUSSION EARLYRE ABOUT THIS TAKING IT ONE DAY AT A TIME OR PAYING ATTENTION TO THAT YOU KNOW TWENTY FOROUR PERIOD IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT I AM ABSOLUTE FASCINATED BY THE WAYS IN WHICH WE ACCUMULATE SUCCESS WHEN WE DO THAT TOTALLY INDEPENDENT OF THE DESIRE FOR SUCCESS IT'S REALLY PROCESS ORIENTED IT'S LIKE WHERE AM I TO DAY HOW CAN I MAKE TO DAY A GOOD AND MEANINGFUL DAY A LITTLE BIT BETTER OR AS GOOD AS SOME OTHER DAYS I'VE HAD CONSTANTLY TWEAKING AND EXPERIMENTING WITH THIS EXPERIMENT THAT WE CALL YOU KNOW OUR HUMAN EXISTENCE AND WHEN WE DO THAT IN A WAY THAT'S AUTHENTIC AND PAYING ATTENTION AND VALUE DRIVEN WHATEVER ARE YOU KNOW VALUES ARE INFORMED BY IT IS VERY VERY INTERESTING HOW THOSE DAYS AGAIN ACCUMULATE AND YOU FIND WELL I GUESS I CONTRIBUTED SOMETHING OF VALUE THERE BUT I WASN'T TRYING TO DO THAT YOU KNOW I THINK THAT'S REALLYT I MEAN WHAT WHAT I'MUS SO AMAZED BY AS LIKE YOU KNOW TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN I WENT TO STAND FOR MEDICAL SCHORE TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO OM YOU KNOW I JUST I WAS HAPPY TOJUST BE A GOOD DOCTOR I WAS LIKE I I GUESS I'M JUST AN A TRY A FIGURE OUT HOW TO BE A GOOD DOCTOR I'M HERE TO LEARN THAT AND NOW I SEE THESE MEDICAL SUNSIN THEI'RE WONDERFUL THEIR BRILLIANT AN THEYRE THEREART THERE L INTENTION TO ALL THAT BUT THE'RE LIKE UM HOW CAN I YOU KNOW RIGHT THE GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL DO MY STARTE UP GO TO AFRICA APPLY FOR THAT GRANT ME IT'S LIKE REALLY I WAS JUST TRYING IF ITLEARN HOW TO BE A DOCTOR AND IT'S AS YOU SAY IT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE ON THEM AND IT'S ALSO KIND OF A WEIRD LEAP FROGING OF THE REAL WAY TO ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING RIGHT BY WHICH ISN'T ABOUT LIKE OH HOW CAN I ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING IT'S LIKE WHAT CAN I DO TO DAY THAT WOULD BE OF SERVICE RIGHT AND THEN FINDING THAT OF TRYING TO BE OBSERVICE A YOU AND AND NOT REALLY GOING FOR RECOGNITION CAN SOMETIMES LEAD TO WHAT PEOPLE CALL SUCCESS ALTHOUGH THAT WASN'T WHAT YOU WARE AIMING FOR AND IT'S ALL THE MORE BEAUTIFUL WHEN IT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE OF SO MUCH BETTER SO MUCH BETTER NO I'M A BE BELIEVER THAT WHEN ONE CAN OM A LINE THE'RE COMPULSION WITH SOME GREATER GOOD YES I SERVICE TO HUMANATY OR THE PLANETS OR ANIMALS WHATEVER IT IS THAT OM THAT'S THAT'S WHERE THTHE REALLY GOOD STUFF EMERGES BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF RECIPROCITY THERE THE WORLD STARTS TO YOU'RE SUPPORTING THE WORLD AND THAN IT SARTS TO

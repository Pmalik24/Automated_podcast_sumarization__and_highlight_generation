WELCOME TO THE HUBERMEN  SCIENCE SCIENCE TAC TO I M INDRHUBERMEN AND OM A PROFESSOR OF NAUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY WE ARE DISCUSSING CREATIVITY CREATIVITY IS A TOPIC THAT TO MANY PEOPLE IS VERY ABSTRACT THAT IS WE KNOW WHEN SOMETHING SEEMS CREATIVE SOME OF US KNOW PEOPLE WHO ARE CREATIVE OR PERHAPS OR CREATIVE AND YET THE ABILITY TO BE CREATIVE RESIDES IN EVERYBODY AND WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE THE NURAL CIRCUITS THAT UNDERLIE CREATIVITY HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT DEFINE AND THE STEPS AND PROCESSES WITHIN THE BRAIN EMBODY THAT LEAD TO CREATIVITY ARE WELL KNOWN THAT SAID MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TO ACCESS CREATIVITY AND IF THEY DO KNOW HOW TO ACCESS CREATIVITY THEY ARE ONLY ABLE TO ACCESS CREATIVITY IN A FAIRLY LIMITED NUMBER OF DOMAINS OF LIFE FOR INSCE IN THE VISUAL ARTS OR IN MUSIC OR WITHIN SCIENCE OR ENGINEERING OR ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT DOMAINS RANGING FROM THE KITCHEN TO SPORT TO CHILDHOOD INTERACTIONS THAT IS CHILDHOOD GAMS IN OTHER WORDS SOME ADULTS ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THEIR CREATIVE SPIRIT WHEN ENGAGING IN CHILD LIKE PLAY WITH CHILDREN OR FOR THAT MATTER WITH ADULTS BUT AS IT TURNS OUT ALL OF CREATIVITY STEMS FROM JUST A SMALL SUBSET OF NEURAL STRUCTURES IN THE BRAIN THAT NEED TO BE ACTIVATED IN A PARTICULAR SEQUENCE OR ORDER TO DAY WE'LL TALK ABOUT WHAT THOSE NEURAL STRUCTURES ARE WHAT PARTICULAR ORDER THEY NEED TO BE ACTIVATED IN IN ORDER TO COME UP WITH FOR INSTANCE NEW IDEAS THAT ARE CREATIVE AND THEN HOW TO IMPLEMENT THOSE CREATIVE STRATEGIES WE WILL ALSO TALK ABOUT DIFFERENT WAYS TO ACCESS CREATIVITY THAT INCLUDE NARRATIVE AND STORY TELLING AS WELL AS APPLYING NEW RUL SETS OR EVEN ENTIRELY NEW WORLD VIEWS AND WE WILL DO THIS IN A STRUCTURED WAY THAT WILL ALLOW ANYONE WHETHER NOT YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF CREATIVE OR NOT TO BE ABLE TO APPLY THESE TOOLS IN DIFFERENT DOMAINS OF LIFE WORK FAMILY PLAY AND ON AND ON BY THE ENDITO IS EPISODE YOU WILL HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT CREATIVITY IS AND HOW TO ACCESS IT AND IF YOU LIKE TO BRING OTHERS INTO YOUR CREATIVE ENDEAVORS WHICH AS YOU'LL SOON LEARN CAN MASSIVELY EXPAND THE EXTENT TO WHICH YOU YOURSELF CAN EXPRESS YOUR CREATIVE TALENTS AS IS THE CASE WITH ALL EPISODES OF THE HUBERMEN LAPODCAST TO DAY WE WILL DISCUSS BOTH SCIENTIFIC MECHANISMS AND NOMEN CLATURE AND I PROMISE TO MAKE ALL F THAT CLEAR TO YOU EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE A BACKGROUND IN BIOLOGY OR PSYCHOLOGY BUT WE WILL ALSO OF COURSE DISCUSS TOOLS THAT IS SPECIFIC STEPS THAT YOU CAN TAKE IN ORDER TO BE MORE CREATIVE ONE PARTICULAR TOOL THAT I'M EXCITED TO SHARE WITH YOU INVOLVES A MEDITATION BUT THIS IS A VERY UNUSUAL MEDITATION THIS IS NOT SITTING WITH EYES CLOSED FOCUSSING ON YOUR BREATH OR FOCUSSING ON A CHIME OR SOME OTHER FEATURE IN YOUR CENSORY ENVIRONMENT OR EVEN IN YOUR BODY LATER WE WILL TALK ABOUT OPEN MONITERING MEDITATIONS OPEN MONITORING MEDITATIONS ARE VERY DISTINCT FROM OTHER FORMS OF MEDITATION AND INVOLVE LEARNING HOW TO SIT BACK AND SIMPLY OBSERVE YOUR THOUGHTS WHILE INTENTIONALLY VARYING WHERE YOUR THOUGHTS GO SO FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT FIND IT A STRUGGLE TO FOCIS OR TO REFOCUS IN MORE TRADITIONAL FORMS OF MEDITATION OR MAYBE EVEN IN YOUR WORK AND EVEN FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT MAY SUFFER FROM THINGS LIKE EIGHTY H T OR SIMILAR OPEN MONETRING MEDITATION CAN BE AN EXTREMELY VALUABLE TOOL FOR ACCESSING YOUR CREATIVE ABILITIES BECAUSE OF THE WAYS THAT ALLOWS YOU TO TAP INTO SPECIFIC CIRCUITS WITHIN THE FRONTAL NETWORKS OF YOUR BRAINS O THESE ARE NETWORKS OF THE BRAIN THAT INCLUDE THE AREAS JUST BEHIND YOUR FOREHEAD AND THAT ALLOW YOU TO EVALUATE NEW AND NOVEL RUL SETS IN A VERY UNCONSTRAINED WAY BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT CREATIVITY IS REALLY THE ABILITY TO TAKE EXISTING ELEMENTS FROM THE PHYSICAL WORLD OR FROM THE THOUGHT WORLD IF YOU WILL OR FROM ANY DOMAIN OF LIFE MOOD THINKING AND INFORMATION AND TO REORDER THOSE INTO NOVEL COMBINATIONS THAT ARE USEFUL FOR SOMETHING AND AS WILL ALSO FIND OUT LATER CREATIVITY HAS ITS INCREDIBLE ASPECT TO IT WHICH IS THAT WHEN WE SEE OR CREATE OR EXPERIENTE SOMETHING THAT IS TRULY CREATIVE IT REVEALS TO U SOMETHING FUNDAMENTAL ABOUT THE WAY THAT THE NATURAL WORLD AND INDEED THE WAY THAT AR BRAINS WORK IF THAT SOUNDS VERY MYSTERIOUS AND ABSTRACT TO YOU NOW I PROMISE THAT BY THE END OF TO DAY'S EPISODE YOU WILL NOT ONLY UNDERSTAND WITH THAT MEANS BUT YOU WILL ALSO UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE OPEN MONITORING MEDITATIONS AS WELL AS OTHER FORMS OF TOOLS IN ORDER TO ACCESS YOUR CREATIVE ABILITY BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FOR MY TEACHING IN RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRON EFFORT TO BRINGS ZEROCOS TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS THLETIC GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND IN TWELVE SOM DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THE REASON I STARTED TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS IN THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETI GREENS ONCE OR TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT HELPS ME COVER ALL OF MY BASIC NUTRICIONAL NEEDS IT MAKES UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT I MIGHT HAVE IN ADDITION IT HAS PROBIOTICS WHICH ARE VITAL FOR MICROBIOM HEALTH I'VE DONE A COUPLE OF EPISODES NOW ON THE SO CALLED GUP MICROBIOM AND THE WAYS IN WHICH THE MICROBIUM INTERACTS WITH YOUR MUN SYSTEM WITH YOUR BRAIN TO REGULATE MOOD AND ESSENTIALY WITH EVERY BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM RELEVANT TO HEALTH THROUGHOUT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WITH OUT LETIC GREENS THIT GET THE VITEMENS I NEED THE MINERALS I NEED END THE PROBIICS TO SUPPORT MY MICROBIOM IF YOU LIKE TO TRIATHLETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO ATHLETIC GREEN STOCK COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THE'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMEN D THREE K TOO THERE ARE TON OF DATA OW SHOWING THAT VITEMEND THREE IS ESSENTIAL FOR VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY HEALTH EVEN I FOR GETTING A LOT OF SUNSHINE MANY OF US ARE STILL DEFICIENT IN VITEMEN D THREE AND K TOO IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT REGULATES THINGS LIKE CARDOVASCULAR FUNCTION CALCIUM IN THE BODY AND SO ON AGAIN GO TO ATHLETIGRANSDOK COLM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THE SPECIAL OFFER OF THE FIVORY TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY OF VIDEMINDY THREE CATO TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENTS IS AN ELECTROLITE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR OF TALK MANY TIMES WE FORE IN THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLE OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLYTES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES AN ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODU MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOES ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEMS CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLYTES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IFHYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE OUR MOOD IS OFF HORMON SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOUR GETTING THE PROPARATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEEMENTE DOT COM SLASH HUBERMEN AND YOU' GET A CREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE THEY'RE ALL DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENTE DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMEN LET'S TALK ABOUT CREATIVITY ON THE FACE OF IT THE WORD CREATIVITY AND CREATIVE ACTS MIGHT SEEM SOMEWHAT ABSTRACT TO US THAT IS WE KNOW WHEN WE SEE SOMETHING THAT WE CONSIDER CREATIVE AND WE KNOW WHEN WE SEE SOMETHING THAT IS NOT CREATIVE THINGS THAT AREN'T CREATIVE OR THINGS THAT WE SEE EVERY DAY ACAR WITH FOR TIRES FOR INSTANC AY BICICLE WITH TWO TIRES NOT CREATIVE HOWEVER WE ALSO SEE THINGS THAT ARE NOVEL THAT ARE DIFFERENT AND THAT WE DON'T REALLY THINK OFE AS CREATIVE IN FACT THEY CAN BE DOWNRIGHT TRIVIAL FOR INSTANCE IF I WERE TO TAKE A FISH TANK AND PUT WINGS ON IT THAT'S A NOVEL COMBINATION OF THINGS WHICH IS ONE OF THE KEY CRITERIA FOR AND ACT OR AND OBJECT OR A PIECE OF MUSIC THAT IS CREATIVE AND YET NEITHER OF US I BELIEVE WOULD FIND IT VERY CREATIVE OR VERY INTERESTING THAT A FISH TANK HAS WINGS ON IT WHY OR WHY NOT I SHOULD SAY WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT FOR SOMETHING TO BE CREATIVE IT ACTUALLY HAS TO REVEAL TO US SOMETHING FUNDAMENTAL ABOUT THE WORLD OR ABOUT HOW WE WORK AND I MUST SAY THAT OFTEN TIMES THE MOST CREATIVE IN THE MOST INTERESTING AND THE MOST BELOVED CREATIVE ACTS WREVEAL TO US SOMETHING FUNDAMENTAL ABOUT THE WORLD OR THE WAY THAT WE WORK IN A WAY THAT DELIGHTS AND THRILLS AND SUPPRISES US BUT THAT WE AREN'T EVEN AWARE WHAT THAT FUNDAMENTAL RUL IS I'LL RETURN TO THIS IN A FEW MINUTES BUT THE TIME BEING LET'S JUST BUILD UP FROM FIRST PRINCIPLES WHAT CONSTITUTE SOMETHING CREATIVE AND WHAT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE SOMETHING CREATIVE CREATIVITY IS A WAY OF INTERACTING WITH THE WORLD OR COMBINING OR RECOMBINING THINGS IN THE WORLD IN A WAY THAT APPEARS NOVEL TO US AND TO OTHER PEOPLE MY EXAMPLE OF A FISH T ANK WITH WINGS ON IT IS NOVEL BUT FRANKLY IT'S NOT VERY CREATIVE AND IT'S NOT VERY INTERESTING IT DOESN'T REVEAL ANYTHING NEW TO US SURE THEIRE FLYING FISH ALTHOUGH YOUNOTHEY JUST CONE OF JUMP FAR THEY DON'T REALLY FLY AND AS A CONSEQUENCE PUTTING WINGS ON A FISH TANK COULD BE USED AS A METAPHOR FOR THE FACT THAT FISH DON'T FLY BUT YOU ALREADY KNEW AND I ALREADY KNEW THAT FISH DON'T FLY AND SO THERE'S NOTHING NOVEL R REVEAL TO US ABOUT THE WORLD EXCEPT SOMETHING WE ALREADY KNEW NOW CREATIVE ACTS ON THE OTHER HAND OF COURSE INVOLVE NOVEL COMBINATIONS OF EXISTING RULE SETS THAT COULD BE DIFFERENT COMMINATIONS OF MUSIC OR COLORS OR SHAPES OR TECHNOLOGY ET CETERA BUT IT DOES SO IN A WAY THAT TELLS US SOMETHING FUNDAMENTAL AND DIFFERENT LET ME GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF A FEW TRULY CREATIVE ARTISTIC ACTS AND I'LL DO THAT IN THE DOMAIN OF VISUAL ARTS BUT OF COURSE THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES THAT COULD COME FROM MUSIC OR FOR MOTHER DOMAIN SPORT ET CETERA EXAMPLES I'LL GIVE RATHER THAN A FISH TANK WITH WINGS ARE FOR INSTANCE THE COMPARISON BETWEEN A DRAWING OR A VERY ACCURATE PAINTING OF A FACE AND ESSHER PAINTING AND A BANXY O CAFE YOU DON'T KNOWHAT THOSE ARE I'LL EXPLAIN FIRST OF ALL LET'S TALK ABOUT AN ACCURATE REPRESENTATION OF A FACE IF I WERE TO SIT YOU DOWN OR IF YOU WERE TO SEND ME A PHOTOGRAPH AND THEN I WERE TO PAINT OR DRAW A PICTURE OF YOUR FACE IN A WAY THAT FAITHFULLY REPRESENTED THE POSITION IN SHAPE OF YOUR NOSE RELATIVE TO THE EYES MAY BE A AYOU KNOW CURL OF THE LIP MAY BE A FEW A YOU KNOW HAIRS OF YOUR EYEBROWS IN A PARTICULAR WAY THAT REALLY CAPTURED YOU ACCURATELY I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD SAY OKA IT'S ACCURATE IT LOOKS A LOT LIKE THE PHOTOGRAPH FOR THE PERSON AND ON THE ONE HAND WHY THAT COULD BE INTERESTING IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY CREATIVE BECAUSE IT FAITHFULLY REPRESENTS WHAT'S ALREADY THERE IN CONTRAST A PAINTING ARE A PICTURE LIKE AN ESHERAND FOR THOSE WHO THAT AREN'T FAMILIAR WITH ESSHERS INVOLVES A LOT OF REPEATING PATTERNS O FOR INSTANCE A BIRD IMAGE THAT'S REPEATED OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN SOMETIMES IN PARTIALLY OVERLAPPING MANNER AND PERHAPS A BUILDING THAT'S REPEATED OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGIN OR STONES REPEATED OVER AD OVER AGAIN OR STAIRCASES OVER AND OVER AGAIN ESSHERS CAPTURE ELEMENTS FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND FAITHFULLY REPRESENT THEM BUT FAITHFULLY REPRESENT THEM OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHICH IS NOT TYPICALLY SEEN IN THE NATURAL WORLD IN FACT MOST OF WHAT OUR VISUAL SYSTEM DOES IS TO ELIMINATE REPETITIVE PATTERNS WHEN WE SEE THEM IN FACT MOST OF WHAT OUR VISUAL SYSTEM DOES IS TRYING MAKE US A BLIND TO REPETATIVE PATTERNS IN OUR VISUAL ENVIRONMENT AND ONLY ALLOW US TO SEE THINGS THAT ARE UNUSUAL IN THAT VISUAL ENVIRONMENT NOW THIS IS E SPECIALLY TRUE AT VISUAL SCALES WHAT I MEAN BY THAT AS IF YOU WERE TO GO TO THE BEACH AND LIE ON YOUR TAWAND LOOK DOWN AT THE SAND YOU WOULD START TO NOTICE THAT THE SAND IS A VERY VERY REPETITIVE PATTERN SO AT VERY SMALL SCALES AND IN PARTICULAR AT MOLECULAR SCALES WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO LEVEL OF ATAMS AND SO FORTH EVERYTHING IS REPETITIVE IT'S THE SAME THINGS JUST REPRODUCED IN DIFFERENT COMMINATIONS OVER AND OVER AGAIN BUT AS WE MOVE THROUGH OUR WORLD TYPICALLY WHERE NOT LOOKING DOWN AT PEBBLES ON THE GROUND OR LITTLE GRAINS OF SAND OR THE PATTERN OF LEAVES IN A PARTICULAR CLOVER SOMETHING OF THAT SORT MOST THF TIME WE'RE LOOKING OUT ON LANDSCAPES ARE AT PEOPLE'S FACES ET CETERA AND VERY SELDOM DO WE SEE HIGHLY REPETIVE PATTERNS OF THAT SCALE SO WHAT ESHERS DO IS THEY ESSENTIALLY REVEAL TO US A FUNDAMENTAL FEATURE ABOUT THE WAY THAT OUR VISUAL SYSTEM WORKS WHICH IS THAT REPETITIVE PATTERNS TEND TO BE COME NOISE IN OUR VISUAL SYSTEM THAT IS ARE BRAIN IN CODES REREPETITION AS THINGS NOT TO BE INTERESTED IN AND THE THINGS THAT STAND OUT AGAINST THAT REPETITION AS THE THINGS TO BE INTERESTED IN SO CALLED SIGNAL TO NOISE WHAT ESSHERS DO IS THEY INVERT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SIGNAL ANNOISE AND THEY MAKE THE REPETITIVE PATTERNS THE SIGNAL AND THE UNUSUAL PATTERNS THE NOISE IN FACT IN EVERY ESHER THERE ARE UNUSUAL PATTERNS AND THOSE COMPLETELY DISAPPEAR TO US NOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT AN ESHER WHAT YOU PROBABLY SEE IN WHAT I SEE ARE JUST A BUNCH OF BIRDS REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN OR BUILDINGS OR STAIRCASES REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND YOU MAY LIKE ESHERS AND YOU MAY NOT THAT'S NOT THE POINT TO DAY WERE NOT TALKING ABOUT TASTE IN PARTICULAR CREATIVE ACTS O WERE TRYING TO IDENTIFY HERE ARE THE RULES AND MECHANISMS OF WHAT CONSTITUTE SOMETHING CREATIVE AND WYATS CREATIVE AND THE KEY ELEMENT HERE IS THAT WHAT'S REVEALED BY AN ESSHER THROUGH THESE RE REPETITION PATTERNS IS AN INVERSION OF THE WAY THAT AURE BRAIN NORMALLY IN CODES F VISUAL IMAGES AND THEREFORE THE RULE THAT REPETITION IS SUPPRESSED IN OUR VISUAL SYSTEM AND THAT UNUSUAL VISUAL FEATURES ARE REVEALED TO US THAT RULE IS WHAT POPS OUT TO US WHEN WE LOOK AT AN ESHER NOW WHEN I SAY POPS OUT I DON'T MEAN THAT YOU LOOK AT AN ESHER AND GO OH NORMALLY I DON'T SEE REPETITION NORMALLY I SEE THE UNUSUAL STUFF ET CETER ET CETERA BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING ABOUT TRULY CREATIVE ACTS THAT CAPTURE THE ATTENTION AND SOMETIMES THE DELIGHT OF MANY MANY PEOPLE IT'S THAT THEY REVEAL A FUNDAMENTAL RULE ABOUT HOW THE BRAIN OR THE WORLD WORK LET ME GIVE YOU A DIFFERENT EXAMPLE ALSO FROM THE VISUAL ART WORLD LET ME GIVE YOU THE EXAMPLE OF BANKSEY BANKSEE IS AN ARTIST THAT MANY OF YOU ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH AND PROBABLY SOME OF YOU ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH SO FOR THOSE WHO YOU THAT ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH BANKSEY BANKSEE IS AN ARTIST THAT MOST OFTEN DOES TWO DIMENTIONAL ART WORK SO THESE WOULD BE STENSILS OR PAINTINGS OR DRAWINGS LIKE MANY ARTISTS AND DOES THEM IN AN URBAN LANDSCAPE AN ACTUAL CITY OR SUBURBAN LANDSCAPE THAT IS HE DRAWS ARE STENSILS OR GRAPHETIES IN A VERY CRIPTIC WAY I SHOULD SAY NO ONE REALLY KNOWS WHO BANKS HE IS OR WHEN HE DOES HIS ART HE JUST REVEALS HIS ART BY PUTTING IT UP BUT HE DOES THIS IN THE CONTECT OF CITIES AND ON THREE DIMENTIONAL OBJECTS SO A GOOD EXAMPLE WOULD BE HE WILL STENSIL NEXT TO A PHONE BOOTH A POLICE OFFICER OR HE WILL GRAPHEDY NEXT TO AN ACTUAL FIRE HYDRANT A DOG LIFTING ITS LEG TO URINATE ON THAT FIRE HYDRANT NOW WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT BANKSEES IS NOT SIMPLY THE FACT THAT HE PUTS TWO DIMENSIONAL ART ON TO THREE DIMENSIONAL SURFACES IN THE URBAN AN SUBURBAN LANDSCAPE BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THAT'S BEEN DONE MANY MANY TIMES BEFORE ALL GRAPHEETI IS THAT ALL SITY ART AND MURALS IS THAT SO WHAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT BANKSY WHITS UNIQUE ABOUT BANKSY OR I SHOULD SAY BANK SEES THE ACTUAL ART IS THAT HE COMBINES TWO DIMENSIONAL ART WITH A THREE DIMENSIONAL LANDSCAPE IN A WAY THAT THE CONCEPT POPS OUT AT YOU WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT WELL IN THE CASE OF THE DOG LIFTING ITS LEG TO URINATE ON THE FIRE HYDRAN THAT'S A SEME THAT MOST PEOPLE AND IN FACT MOST CHILDREN ARE FAMILIAR WITH FROM CARTOONS ORE FROM OUR BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE STEROTEP OF DOGS AND MUST TELL YOU HAVING OWNED A MALE DOG A BULLDOG COSTELLOFOR MANY YEARS HYDRANTS WERE A PARTICULAR TARGET FOR COSTELLE OF COURSE EVERYTHING WAS A PARTICULAR TYRGAT FOR COSTELLE URINATING OUTDOORS NONE THE LESS HE LIKE TO PE ON FIRE HYDRANTS THAT ITSELF IS NOT INTERESTING SEEING A PHOTOGRAPH OF A DOG RAISING ITS LEG TO PION A FIRE HYDRAN IS NOT INTERESTING SEEING A PAINTING OF THAT ISN'T INTERESTING SEEING AN ACTUAL DOG URINATING ON A FIEHYDRAN ISN'N INTERESTING IN FACT SEEING A PAINTING IN TWO DIMENSIONS OF A DOG RAISING ITS LEG TO OF COURSE IT CAN'T ASHA URINATE BUT GIVE YOU THE IMPRESSION THAT IT WOULD URANATE ON THAT FIRE HYDRAN ISN'T PARTICULARLY INTERESTING EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT IT REVEALS TO US SOMETHING FUNDAMENTAL WHICH IS THAT WE TEND TO PAIR VISUAL RELASIONSHIPS BETWEEN DIFFERENT OBJECTS THAT SHARE A COMMON THEME AND THEN THE THEME TENDS TO POP OUT US SO FOR INSTANCE THE DOG RAISING ITS LEG NEXT TO A FIRE HYDRAN EVEN IF THE DOG IS DRAWN IN TWO DIMENSIONS IN THE FIRE HYDRAN IS IN THREE DIMENSIONS ALLOWS THE CONCEPT OF DOG AND FIRE HYDRAN TO EMERGE OR POP OUT AT US WHICH REVEALS TO US SOMETHING FUNDAMENTAL ABOUT HOWOUR BRAIN WORK WHICH IS THAT OUR BRAIN INCODES CONCEPTS AND ENTIRE STORIES AS SYMBOLS OF INTERACTION BETWEEN DIFFERENT OBJECTS ME GIVE YOU A DIFFERENT EXAMPLE JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS HITS HOME ONE OF BANXEE'S MORE FAMOUS PAINTINGS IS A RATHER POLITICALLY CHARGED ONE WHICH IS OF A GIRL HOLDING A BOUQUET OF BALLOONS AND THIS TWO DIMENSIONAL DRAWING WAS PUT ON TO THE WEST WALL DIVIDING TERRITORIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST A VERY CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE THE CONTROVERSIES OF THAT IS SURE NOT WHAT I WANT TO GET INTO BUT I DON'T THINK ANYONE WO DOUBT THAT IS A CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE THE TWO DIMENSIONAL DRAWING OF THE GIRL WITH THE BALLOONS ON THE ACTUAL WALL TURNS OUT TO BE QUITE INTERESTING AS AN ART PIECE BECAUSE WHAT IT REVEALS TO US IS THE ENTIRE CONTROVERSY AROUND THE PRESENCE OF THAT WALL AND THE DESIRE FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE TO BREACH THAT WALL AND THE DESIRE FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO INSISTS THAT THAT WHILE NOT BE BREACHED FOR WHATEVER REASON AGAIN THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE PARTICULAR CONTROVERSY THE POINT IS THAT A TWO DIMENSIONAL IMAGE COMBINED WITH A THREE DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE ALLOWS THE PURPOSE OF THAT THREE DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE AND THE CONTROVERSY AROUND THAT THREE DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE TO POP OUT AT US IN A WAY THAT IF FOR INSTANCE WE HAD JUST SEEN A PHOTOGRAPH OF SOMEBODY NEXT TO THAT WALL OR WITH THE LATTER OR IF WE JUST SEEN A DRAWING OF A GIRL HOLDING A BOUQUET OF BALLOONS ON A DRAING OF THAT WALL TO NOT EMERGE IN OTHER WORDS IT CAPTURES TWO FUNDAMENTAL FEATURES OF THE VISUAL SYSTEM OUR ABILITY TO INCOD THINGS IN TWO DIMENSIONS AND UNDERSTAND SYMBOLS AND OUR ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND THINGS IN THREE DIMENSIONS AND PARTICULAR THE WALL IS HA THREE DIMENSIONAL OBJECT IS REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE IT'S INACTUAL PHYSICAL BARRIER SO SHOWING IT AS THE ACTUAL PHYSICAL BARRIER THAT IT IS IN REAL SPACE IN THREE DIMENSIONS TURNS OUT TO ALLOW THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THOSE TWO THINGS THE CONCEPT THE CONTROVERSY TO POP OUT AT US AND MAKE US THINK ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR CONTROVERSY AN PERHAPS WHERE WE EACH INDIVIDUALLY STAND ON THAT CONTROVERSY NOW THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES OF WHAT I JUST GAVE IN THE VISUAL DOMAIN FOR INSTANCE A ROTHGOES WHICH ARE JUST COLOR ON CANVAS ARE PARTICULARLY INTERESTING SOURCE OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE WAY THAT THE BRAIN IND COTS COLOR LATER ALL FILLIN WHAT EXACTLY WITH THAT INFORMATION IS YOU MAY LIKE GROTH GOES YOU MAY NOT BUT I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING WHEN YOU LOOK AT A ROTH GO YOU ARE SEEN COLORS IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY THAN YOU WOULD EVER SEE COLORS IN ANY OTHER CONTECT THE FACT THAT THEY DON'T HAVE A FRAME TYPICALLY AND THE FACT THAT THERE'S NO WHITE CANVAS ALLOWS THE COLORS THAT YOU SEE TO BE NOVEL HUES OF THOSE COLORS THAT YOU WILL NOT SEE IN ANY OTHER CONTEXT AND IN DOING SO REVEALS TO YOU WHAT YOUR BRAIN DOES IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND AND EXTRACT COLOR NOW IN THE CONTECTS OF MUSIC FOR INSTANCE YOU WILL SOMETIMES HEAR A STREET MUSICIAN PLAY A SAW MAY BE ABOBDILLAN SONG OR LET ZEPPLAN SONG OR PINK FLOID SONG PRETTY CLOSELY PRETTY ACCURATELY TO THE WAY THAT SONG IS PLAYED BUT OF COURSE THAT'S NOT CREATIVE THAT'S JUST LIKE THE PHOTOGRAPH OR THE ACCURATE PORTRAIT OF SOMEBODY'S FACE OR YOU MAY HEAR IN A COUSTIC VERSION OF WHAT'S NORMALLY AN ELECTRICATAR SONG OR ELECTRICAL SONG OR VICEVERSA SOMEWHAT CREATIVE SOMETIMES SOUNDS EVEN BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL BUT NOT PARTICULARLY CREATIVE HOWEVER EACH IN EVERY ONE OF US HAS A PARTICULAR TASTE OF MUSIC MAY BE ITS CLASSICAL MAY BE ITS ROCK MAY BE ITS PONK MAY BE ITS HIPPOP WITHIN EACH OF THO JONRAS I THINK ALL OF US ARE FAMILIAR WITH HEARING SOMETHING FOR THE FIRST TIME AND MAYBEVEN EVERY TIME AND THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE COMMINATION OF THE WORDS AND THE MUSIC OR SOMETIMES JUST THE MUSIC OR JUST THE WORDS THAT ALLOWS SOME FEATURE OF IT TO POP OUT AT US AS PARTICULARLY EXCITING AND WHEN WE FEEL THAT EXCITEMENT AND WE FEEL THAT IT'S REALLY NOVEL IT'S DIFFERENT THIN WHAT WE'VE HARD BEFORE I ASSURE YOU WHAT IT'S REVEALING TO YOU IS THE WAY THAT YOUR AUDITORY SYSTEM AND OFTEN YOUR AUDITORY AND YOUR EMOTIONAL SYSTEM IN CODES INFORMATION THAT YOU HEAR AND AGAIN THE RULE THAT IT'S REVEALING IS NOT SPLAYED OUT FOR YOU FOR INSTANCE IT'S NOT TOLD TO YOU OH THIS IS THE WAY YOU NORMALLY HEAR AND NOW YOU'RE HEARING THINGS DIFFERENTLY SOMETIMES IT'S THE CHANGE IN FOR INSTANCE IN THE WAY THAT WORDS ARE ACCENTED OF THE WAY THAT SENTENCES ARE CONSTRUCTED THIS OFTEN YOU'LL HEAR AN HIPPOP THE WAY THAT SENTENCES ARE CONSTRUCTED CAN BE DIVIDED UP NOT AS NORMAL DECLARATIVE SENTENCES THE WAY THAT THEIRE TYPICALLY WRITTEN BUT THE WAY THAT SENTENCES ARE CHOPPED UP IN AND FRACTURED REVEALS TO US NEW MEANING AND IN FACT ENHANCED MEANING ABOUT PARTICULAR WORDS THAT WE WOULDN'T SEE IF IT WAS WRITTEN OUT AS A PARAGRAPH AND THEN SUNG IS A SCRIPT THAT WOULD BE THE SAME AS THE ONE WE WOULD READ AGAIN THE POINT IS THAT WHAT IS EXCITING AND NOVEL TO YOU IS JUST THE WAY THAT YOU HEAR IT BUT IT'S EXCITING AND NOVEL TO YOU BECAUSE THERE ARE CIRCUITS WITHIN THE BRAIN THAT WHEN WE HEAR OR SEE OR FEEL OR EXPERIENTS KNOWN ELEMENTS IN NEW WAYS THAT ARE TRULY CREATIVE THE WAY THAT THOSE NERAL CIRCUITS FUNCTION IS CHANGED AND WHEN NERL CIRCUITS CHANGE THE WAY THAT THEY FUNCTION SIMPLY BY WAY OF WHAT COMES INTO OUR EYES OUR EARS AND THE WAY THAT WE EXPERIENCE OUR FEELINGS THERE IS THE RELEASE OF CHEMICALS INCLUDING THE RELEASE OF THE CHEMICAL DOPOMING AND OTHER NEROMODULATORS AS WELL THAT MAKE US FEEL BOTH SUPPRISED DELIGHTED AND THIS IS VERY KEY EXCITED IN ANTICIPATION THAT WE MIGHT SEE IT AGAIN SO WITH THE UNDERSTANDING IN MINE THAT TRUE CREATIVITY INVOLVES THE NOVEL COMBINATION OF SOME ELEMENTS COULD BE NOTES OF MUSIC COULD BE NUMBERS COULD BE VISUAL ELEMENTS LIKE LINES OR COLORS COULD BE PHYSICAL MOVEMENTS ET CETERA BUT NOVEL COMBINATIONS OF SOME THINGS THAT REVEAL TO US SOMETHING FUNDAMENTAL ABOUT THE WAY THAT OR BRAIN AND OR THE WORLD WORK AND OF COURSE AS I MENTION BEFOR THAT FUNDAMENTAL THING MAY OR MAY NOT BE CONSCIOUSLY ACCESSIBLE TO US WE MAY NOT KNOW WHAT EXACTLY IT IS THAT'S NOVEL TO US BUT IT FEELS NOVEL END IT FEELS TRUE WELL WITH THAT UNDERSTANDING IN MINE WE THEREFORE CAN ASK WHAT ARE THE UNDERLINE PRINCIPLES AND NERAL CIRCUITS THAT UNDERLIE THE CREATIVE PROCESS ANDTHE WORD PROCESS HERE IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN FACT IF THERE'S ONE THING I'D REALLY LIKE TO IMPRESS ON EVERYBODY IS THAT WHEN THINKING ABOUT BIOLOGY IT'S ALMOST ALWAYS BETTER TO THINK ABOUT VERBS AS OPPOSED TO NOUNS SO RATHER THAN THINK OF CREATIVITY AS A NOUN OR SOMEBODY BEING CREATIVE AS AN ADJECTIVE THINK ABOUT THE VERB CREATIVITY THAT IS WHAT ARE THE STEPS REQUIRED AND THEREFORE WHAT ARE THE CELLS AND CIRCUITS AND THOUGHTS ET CETERA REQUIRED IN ORDER TO BE CREATIVE THIS ELEMENT OF THINKING ABOUT VERBS THEN ALLOWS US TO SAY OCAY WHAT ARE THE VARIOUS STEPS IN COMING UP WITH A CREATIVE IDEA IN TESTING A CREATIVE IDEA AND THEN IMPLEMENTING THAT CREATIVE IDEA AND IN DOING SO WE FIND BASED ON THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE THAT THEY ARE BASICALLY THREE MAJOR NETWORKS WITHIN THE BRAIN EACH OF WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EACH OF THE THREE STEPS TO ARRIVE AT SOMETHING TRULY CREATIVE THE FIRST NERL CIRUIT INVOLVED IN CREATIVITY IS THE SO CALLED EXECUTIVE NETWORK THIS KIND OF A GOOFY NAME BECAUSE THE NURAL CIRCUITS THAT A'M ABOUT TO DESCRIBE DO A BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS AS WELL BUT THEY CERTAINLY CONTROL WHAT ARE CALLED EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS ARE FUNCTIONS THAT YOU AND I BO HAVE WHICH IS OUR ABILLITY TO GOVERN OUR THINKING IN OUR BEHAVIOR IN VERY DELIBERATE WAYS AND THAT IS LARGELY ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE USE OF THE NERL CIRCUITRY THAT SITS RIGHT BEHIND THE FOREBRAIN THE SO CALLED PREFRONTAL QUARTEX NOW THE PREFONTAL QUARTEX INVOLVES MANY DIFFERENT SUBREGIONS IT HAS A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT PARTS JUST LIKE ANY COUNTRY HAS DIFFERENT STATES ET CETERA AND PROVINCES EXECUTIVE FUNCTION INVOLVES THE PREFONTAL QUARTEX AND SOME OTHER NERL STRUCTURES BUT FORSAKE OF THIS DISCUSSION EXATIVE FUNCTION AND THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX ARE MAINLY RESPONSIBLE FOR SUPPRESSING ACTION THAT IS FOR ELIMINATING CHOICES AMONG THE INFINITE NUMBER OF CHOICES THAT EXIST FOR INSTANCE OF WHAT COLORS TO COMBINE ON A PAINTING OR WHAT LINES TO DRAW OR WHAT NOTES TO PLAY OR WHAT MOVEMENTS TO MAKE IN A SPORTS ENDEAVOR WHAT NUMBERS TO INCLUDE IN AMATHEMATICS ENDEAVOR OR WHAT WORDS AND LETTERS AND SYLLABLES AND SENTENCES TO INCLUDE IN WRITING A CREATIVE PASSAGE THE SECOND NETWORK IS THE SO CALLED DEFAULT MODE NETWORK THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION NOW DAYS ABOUT THE DEFAULT MODE NETWORK AS IT RELATES TO CONSCIOUSNESS AND MEDITATION ET CETERA THE DEFAULT MODE NETWORK DOES MANY DIFFERENT THINGS BUT IN THE CONTECTS OF OUR DISCUSSION ABOUT CREATIVITY THE DEFAULT MODE NETWORK IS REALLY THE NETWORK THAT STARTS BEING ENGAGED WHEN YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES AND START PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT'S GOING ON IN TERMS OF YOUR THINKING AS OPPOSED TO THIS SENSORY OUTSIDE WORLD AND THE DEFAULT MODE NETWORK IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR WHAT'S CALLED SPONTANEOUS IMAGINATION NOW SPONTANEOUS IMAGINATION IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN TRY AT ANY MOMENT IF YOU WERE TO CLOSE YOUR EYES AND TO TRYING NOT PAY ATTENTION TO THE SOUNDS AROUND YOU BUT EVEN IF YOU DO TO JUST PAY ATTENTION TO WHATEVER THOUGHTS OR FEELINGS EMERGE WHEN YOUR EYES ARE CLOSE GEN BY CLOSING YOUR EYES AND SHUTTNG YOURSELF OFF TO THE OUTSIDE CENSORY WORLD YOU START TO ENGAGE MUCH MORE OF YOUR BRAIN MACHINERY DEDICATED TOWARDS WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE YOU SO CALLED IN TERRECEPTION BUT ALSO WHAT YOUR THINKING ABOUT YOUR THINKING WHETHER NOT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE COMPLETE OR INCOMPLETE WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE FRAGMENTARY IN AWAY THAT GOES FROM ONE THOUGHT TO ANOTHER DISTANTLY IN THE PAST OR PRESENT TO FUTURE ET CETERA DEPENDING ON TIME OF DAY HOW WELL RESTED YOU ARE HOW STRESSED YOU ARE HOW HAPPY YOU ARE THE DEFAULT MODE NETWORK WILL TAKE YOU THROUGH A JOURNEY OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF THOUGHTS DIFFERENT TYPES OF FEELINGS ET CETERA THE SPECIFIC TYPES OF THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS ARE NOT AS INTERESTING AS THE FACT THAT WHEN YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES YOUR ESSENTIAL ENGAGING THIS DEFAULT MODE NETWORK WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY THE NETWORK ASSOCIATE WITH IMAGINATION AND IMAGINATION BASED ON ELEMENTS THAT EXIST ONLY WITHIN YOUR HEAD THAT IS WITHIN YOUR BRAIN AND THEREFORE MUST RELY ON MEMORY OF PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES AS SOON AS YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES YOU ARE SHUTTING YOURSELF OFF FROM THE CENSORY WORLD SO BY DEFINITION YOU CAN NO LONGER BE BRINGING IN NOVEL EXPERIENCES IN THAT MOMENT YOURE RELYING ON YOUR LIBRARY OF EXISTING EXPERIENCES IN YOUR MEMORY OF THOSE IN ORDER TO IMAGINE NEW THINGS AND OU'RE DOING THIS IN THE VERY AND A FRE ASSOCIATIVE WAY YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO IMAGINE THINGS IS JUST WHATEVER GUISORS TO THE SURFACE O CASES WE'VE GOT THE EXECUTIVE NETWORK WHICH IS INVOLVED IN SUPPRESSING PARTICULAR THOUGHTS OR ACTIONS WE HAVE THE DEFAULT MODE NETWORK WHICH IS INVOLVED IN IMAGINATION AND THE DEFAULT MODE NETWORK I SHOULD MENTION ALSO INVOLVES US SUBREGION OF THE PREFONTA QUARTEXTICAL THE MEDIAL PREFRONTAL QUARTECS BUT OTHER BRAIN REGIONS AS WELL AND THEN THE FINAL ELEMENT WITHIN THE CIRCUITS UNDERLYING CREATIVITY IS THE SO CALLED SALIENTS NETWORK THE SALIENT'S NETWORK IS A NETWORK OF BRAIN REGIONS THAT INVOLVES AREAS SUCH AS THE INSULA WHICH ACSHLLY HAS A COMPLETE MAP OF YOUR BODY SURFACE AS WELL AS SOME INFORMATION MAPPED THERE ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND HOW THOSE COMBINE WITH WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR INTERNAL LANDSCAPE THAT IS WITHIN YOUR BODY ALSO BRAIN REGION CALLED THE A C C OR INTING SCUSE ME ANTERIOR SINGULATE QUARTEXS AND THE IMIG DOLA SO LOT OF INFORMATION IS MAPPED WITHIN THE SALIENTS NETWORK ABOUT HOW WE FEEL AND HOW WE FEEL IN RELATION TO THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING AROUND US AND WITHIN US AND THE SALINT'S NETWORK HAS ONE MAIN JOB WHICH IS TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT'S MOST INTERESTING EITHER IN THE WORLD OR INSIDE US IN TERMS OF FEELINGS OR EXPERIENCES OCASES SO WE'VE GOT THREE NETWORKS EXECUTIVE NETWORK WHICH IS THERE TO SUPPRESS CHOICES IN TERMS OF ACTIONS WE COULD TAKE BUT DECIDE NOT TO OR THINGS WE COULD THINK ABOUT BUT CHOOSE NOT TO OR TRY NOT TO THE DEFAULT MODE NETWORK WHICH IS TASIDLY THET CATALOGUE OR LIBRARY OF PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO US THAT WOULD ACT A SORT OF THE PINTS ON A PALET OR THE POSSIBLE O INGREDIENTS THAT COULD GO INTO A RECIPE ALL OF THAT HAS TO AGAIN ARISE FROM PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE D WE CAN'T CLOSE OUR EYES AND SUDDENLY BE ABLE TO ACCESS ALL THE MELODIES THAT WE'VE NEVER HEARD BEFORE OR ALL TH OUR IDEAS AND CONCEPTS AND KNOWLEDGE ABOUT MUSIC IF WE DON'T HAVE MUSICAL UNDERSTANDING OR VISUAL UNDERSTANDING SO WE REALLY DRAWING UP THE LIBRARY AND THAT LIBRARY TENDS TO BE RATHER DISORGANIZE A CIND OF SWIRLS AROUND ITS NOT VERY STRUCTURED UNLESS WE'RE ACTIVELY TRYING TO THINK ABOUT SOMETHING AND THEN WE HAVE THE SALIENTS NETWORK WHICH IS THE NETWORKS WITHIN THE BRAIN THAT DECIDE OR MAKE CHOICES ABOUT WHAT'S MOST INTERESTING TO PAY ATTENTION TO INAGIVEN MOMENT CES TO THOSE THREE NETWORKS WORK TOGETHER TO CREATE THINGS AND WHEN I SAY CREATE THINGS WE GAIN HAVE TO REALLY UNDER SCORE OR DEFINITION OF CREATIVITY CREATIVITY IS A REARRANGEMENT OF EXISTING ELEMENTS INTO NOVEL COMBINATIONS THAT REVEALS SOMETHING FUNDAMENTAL ABOUT HOW WE OR THE WORLD WORKS AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT IT TENDS TO BE THINGS THAT ARE USEFUL NOW THEY CAN MERELY BE USEFUL BECAUSE THE'RE ENTERTAINING OR THRILLING THAT CAN ALSO HAVE A PARTICULAR UTILITY OR USE IN THE WORLD LIKE A PIECE OF TECNOLOGY THAT IS ACTUALLY USEFUL LIKE A AP OR A SMART PHONE OR COMPUTER ACTUALLY HAS UTILITY OR A VEHICLE NO THERE ARE CREATIVE ACTS THAT LED TO THE FORMATION OF VEHICLES AND COMPUTERS ET CETERA BUT THE POINT IS THAT JUST MERELY COMING UP WITH NOVEL COMBINATIONS OF THINGS LIKE WINGS ON A FISH TANK THAT'S NOT CREATIVE OR IT'S NOT CR REATIVE IN ANY KIND OF MEANINGFUL WAY BECAUSE IT SIMPLY NOT USEFUL IT DOESN'T REVEAL ANYTHING FUNDAMENTAL NEW OR PURPOSEFUL IT DOESN'T ALLOW US TO THINK ABOUT OR INTERACT WITH THE WORLD OR OURSELVES IN NOVEL WAYS WHEREAS THINGS PEOPLE ACTIONS AN IDEAS THAT ARE TRULY CREATIVE REALLY CHANGE THE WAY THAT WE ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THE WORLD THEY ACT AS PORTALS TO THE WORLD AND TO OURSELVES SO NOW YOU HAVE SOME IDEA ABOUT THE BRAIN AREAS AND NETWORKS INVOLVED IN CREATIVITY BUT I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT ANY TIME WE TALK ABOUT MECHANISMS AND BRAIN AREAS WHAT'S FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE NAMES OF THOSE BRAIN AREAS IS AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THEY DO SO IF YOU COULDN'T REMEMBER THE INTERIOR SINGULAR QUARTAXS OR THE FACT THAT THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX IS INVOLVED IN EXECUTIVE FUNCTION ET CETERA THAT'S FINE IT'S LESS IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW THE NAMES OF THINGS THAN YOU UNDERSTAND THE ACTION STEPS THAT THOSE THINGS TAKE THAT IS THE VERB ACTIONS THAT THOSE PARTICULAR BRAIN AREAS ENGAGE IN ORDER TO ARRIVE AT A PARTICULAR END POINT IN THE IN POINT WERE TALKI ABOUT TODAY IS CREATIVITY I WANT TO DISCUSS CREATIVITY IN TERMS TO WHAT ACTUALLY GOES IN TO BEING CREATIVE AND IT TURNS OUT THERE JUST TWO ELEMENTS AND THOSE TWO ELEMENTS ARE NOW WELL UNDERSTOOD FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF PSYCHOLOGY AND FORTUNATELY THE NORO SCIENCE WELL SUPPORTS WHAT THE PSYCHOLOGY SAYS AN VICE VERSA AND THOSE TWO ELEMENTS THET GO INTO COMING UP WITH A CREATIVE IDEA AND THEN IMPLEMENTING OR DEVELOPING THAT CREATIVE IDEA INTO SOMETHING REAL THAT YOU AND THE REST OF THE WORLD CAN EXPERIENCE OR DIVERGENT THINKING AND CONVERGENT THINKING AND DIVERGENT THINKING AND CONVERGENT THINKING ARE VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD TO UNDERSTAND DIVERGENT THINKING IS TAKING SOME NOWN OBJECT OR EVENT IN THE WORLD OR SPORT OR CONCEPT IT COULD BE RUNNING IT COULD BE A MUSICAL NOTE IT COULD BE JUMPING IT COULD BE A PARTICULAR COLLER ON A PIECE OF PAPER AND ASKING YOURSELF HOW MANY DIFFERENT THINGS COULD THAT THING ACTUALLY BE YOU MIGHT SAY WHELL RUNNING IS RUNNING BUT LET'S USE DIVERGENT THINKING AS A WAY TO ILLUSTRATE WHAT DIVERGENT THINKING IS IF I SHOW YOU A PICTURE OF SOMEBODY RUNNING SAY WHAT YOU SEE AND YOU SAY I SEE SOMEBODY RUNNING AND THEN I MIGHT GIVE YOU A DIVERGENT THINKING TASK IN THESE TAXTSS ARE THE SAME ONES USED IN VARIOUS EXPERIMENTS AND I' HOW MANY DIFFERENT THINGS CAN YOU THINK ABOUT BASED ON THIS PICTURE THAT YOU SEE OF SOMEBODY RUNNING NOW IF YOU ARE ABLE TO ENGAGE DIVERGENT THINKING YOU COULD SAY RUNNING TO THE STORT RUNNING AWAY FROM A LION RUNNING TOWARDS SOMEBODY I LOVE OR MAY BEYOU HAVE A MORE ELABORATE IMAGINATION AND YOU COULD SAY RUNNING IN FRONT OF A BUS TO GRAB A KID SO THE KID DOESN'T GET HIP BY THE BUS OR RUNNING TOWARD A CONCERT BECAUSE I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT THE PARTICULAR CONCERT AND THAN IT STARTS TO SPHOOL INTO A STORY IN OTHER WORDS DIVERGENT THINKING INVOLVES TAKING ONE SIMPLE WHAT WE WOULD CALL I NEURO SCIENCE OR PSYCHOLOGY STIMULUS ONE IMAGE OR SOUND ET CETERA AND C RYING TO RADIATE OUT FROM THAT AS MANY DIFFERENT DIVERGENT SITUATIONS PROPERTIES CHARACTERISTICS EVENTS THINGS FROM THAT ONE SPECIFIC ELEMENT SO ANY DIVERGEN THINK KING TASK WOULD INVOLVE EXACTLY THAT I'D SHOW YOU PICTURERS OR PLAY YOU SOUNDS ER WORDS WERE NOTES OR DESCRIBE TO YOU EVENTS IN HISTORY AND TRYING SEE HOW MANY THINGS CAN RADIATE OUT FROM THAT INTO DIVERSE DIVERSE EVEN DISTANT TYPES OF CONCEPTS AND PICTURES WHIT CASE O THAT'S DIVERGENT THINK DIVERGENT THINKING IS REALLY THE PROCESS THAT UNDERLIES IDEA GENERATION END THE BASIS OF I DIVERGENT THINKING IS THAT MORE THAN ONE IDEA IS CORRECT IN FACT THE MORE IDEAS THAT YOU HAVE ABOUT ONE THING THE BETTER YOU'RE DIVERGENT THINKING SO IF I WERE TO GIVE YOU THREE MINUTES TO LIST OFF ALL THE THINGS YOU CAN THINK ABOUT RELATED TO THIS PEN THAT I'M HOLDING UP FOR THOSE YOULIIEUM TUS HOLDING UP A PEN IN FRONT OF ME YOU'RE JUST RITE THEM OUT OR SAY THEM OUT OVER THE NEXT THREE MINUTES THAT WOULD BE AN EXAMPLE OF DIVERGENT THINKING HOWEVER IF YOU JUST SAID BLACK PEN RED PEN WHITE PEN GREEN PEN ET CETERA THAT'S NOT VERY DIVERGENT THING IT'S ONLY DIVERGENT IN THE CONTECTS OF COLOR SPACE AND I SAY SPACE THAT'S JUS SO A CAN ABNERD SPEAK FOR ONE PARTICULAR DOMAIN OF THINKING WHEREAS IF YOU SAID UM RED PEN WHITE PEN ESSAY UM PEN IN A DOOR TO HOLD THE DOOR OPEN SO THAT SOME ONE CAN RETURN TO A BUILDING AND YOU TARTED SPOOLING OFF A STORY RELATED TO THAT AND WHY THAT WAS IMPORTANT WHILE THERE YOU GO DIVERGEN THINKING IS SEMPALY TAKING ONE ELEMENT AND COMING UP WITH MANY MANY ANSWERS AND IN THE CONTECTS OF DIVERGEN THINKING ANY ANSWER GOES BUT AS WE'LL SOON LEARN NOT EVERY ANSWER IS INTERESTING AND RELEVANT THAT IS NOT EVERY ANSWER HELP SOLVE SOMETHING OR REVEAL SOMETHING FUNDAMENTAL THEREFOR NOT EVERY DIVERGENT ANSWER IS TRULY CREATIVE THE OTHER ASPECT OF DIVERGENT THINKING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND IS THAT THE SELECTION CRITERIA ARE EXTREMELY VAGUE AND VAST THAT IS THERE'RE NO CONSTRAINTS ON WHAT YOU COME UP WITH SO IF I HOLD UP THIS PEN AND YOU SAY ARANGA TAN THAT'S A PERFECTLY VALID DIVERGENT IDEA FROM THIS PEN BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT OF IT AND IT'S DISTANTLY RELATED HOWEVER WE HAVE TO REMEMBER ARE EARLIER RULE IF BLACK PEN AND ARANGA TAN ARE NOT LINKED UP IN OUR BRAIN AND THE OBSERVERS BRAIN IN ANY KIND OF MEANINGFUL WAY IT'S ONLY INTERESTING TO YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE THAT UNDERSTANDS THE RULE THAT UNDERLIES THE LINK BETWEEN THIS PEN AND ARANGTO TEN WHEREAS IF YOU COME UP WITH SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAT SOMEHOW TELLS ME AND EVERYBODY ELSE SOMETHING INTERESTING ABOUT PENS OR RANGATANS NOW THAT'S A TRULY CREATIVE IDEA I DON'T HAVE SUCH AN EXAMPLE IN MIND BUT LATER I'LL GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW YOU CAN ACTUALLY MARCH DOWN THE PATH OF DIVERGENT THINKING AND USE THAT EXECUTIVE NETWORK TO SUPPRESS CERTAIN OPTIONS TO CROSS OFF CERTAIN ANSWERS IS AGAIN ANY ANSWERS VALID BUT NOT ALL VALID ANSWERS ARE INTERESTING OR USEFUL AND YOU CAN CROSS THOSE OFF AND ARRIVE AT THE MOST INTERESTING AND TRULY CREATIVE ANSWER COUPLEMORE THINGS ABOUT DIVERGEN THINKING DIVERGEN THINKING LARGELY TAPS INTO THE NET WORKS OF THE BRAIN THEY'RE INVOLVED IN MENTAL FLEXIBILITY SO THIS IS A DIFFERENT ASPECT OF OUR PREFRONTAL QUARTEXES WHICH IS NOT BASED ON EXECUTIVE FUNCTION AND OUR ABILITY TO REDUCE OPTIONS BUT RATHER AREAS OF THE PREFRONTAF QUARTEXS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO GENERATE MULTIPLE OPTIONE AND ACTUALLY SUPPRESS CONTEXT RIGHT TO FORGET THAT PENS ARE JUST FOR WRITING FOR INSTANCE AND THAT PENDS CAN DO OTHER THINGS LIKE HOLD THE DOOR OPEN IT'S REALLY A KIND OF AN UNUSUAL USE OF A PEN AGAIN NONE OF THESE EXAMPLES THAT I'M GIVING ARE PARTICULARLY INTERESTING THEY'RE JUST DESIGN TO GET YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE UNDERLYING CONCEPT OF DIVERGENT THINKING AND THEN THE LASTIN THAT LIKE YOU KNW ABOUT DIVERGEN THINKING S THAT DIVERGEN THINKING INVOLVES A SORT OF EXPLORATION IT'S A WANDERING THROUGH OF IDEAS THAT YOU ALREADY HAD IN YOUR LIBRARY IN YOUR MEMORY BANKS ABOUT PENS AND WHAT PENS COULD BE RELATED TO AND WHAT PENS OUGHT NOT TO BE RELATED TO SO AGAIN WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ABOUT CREATIVITY IS THAT THERE HAS TO BE THE BASIC BUILDING BLOCKS ALREADY EXISTING WITHIN US THIS IS WHY IT' SO IMPORTANT T UNDERSTAND THAT IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO REALLY SEEKS TO BE CREATIVE YOU REALLY DO NEED TO BE SOMEBODY WHO FORAGES FOR INFORMATION AND STRUCTURED INFORMATION IN PARTICULAR IF YOU ARE TO BE CREATIVE THE ARCHITECT SIMPLY CAN'T COME UP WITH INCREDIBLE DRAWINGS ARE PLANS FOR BUILDINGS WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING HOW BUILDINGS ARE PUT TOGETHER IN THE VARIOUS RULES THAT GOVERN BUILDINGS IN OTHER WORDS YOU CAN'T BREAK RULES THAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND I THINK IN A IN MOVIES ESPECIALLY WE HAVE THIS IDEA IN MIND THAT OF THIS LIMITLESS CONCEPT THAT OR THAT WE HAVE THESE HIDDEN GENIUSES THAT SOMEHOW HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THE MATH KNOWLEDGE WITHOUT EVER HAVING DONE ANY FORMAL MATHECTULLY A AS FLYING BACK OT FROM TEXAS RECENTLY IN GOODWILL HUNTING WAS ON SOMEBODY'S SCREEN I DON'T TEN TO WATCH MOVIES ON THE PLAIN VERY OFTEN SOMETIMES BUT NOT OFTEN AND I WAS REMEMBERING N THAT MOVINA O'VE GOT THIS MATH GENIUS A WHO IS A JANITER DAM MITEE ET CETERA AND APPARENTLY JUST HAS ACCESS TO ALL THIS KNOWLEDGE IT'S A WONDERFUL CONCEPT A A VERY VARY I WOULD SAY EVEN EXCEEDINGLY RARE THING TO OCCUR IN THE WORLD SURE THEIRE PEOPLE WHO SEEM HAVE A NATURAL TALENT FOR MATHEMATICS OR FOR SOMETHING ELSE BUT THIS IDEA THAT THERE ARE A INCREDIBLE GENIUSIS AMONG US THAT JUST SPONTANEOUSLY HAVE SO MUCH KNOWLEDGE THAT'S BY FAR THE EXCEPTION RATHER THAN THE RULE OF COURSE AND MAY NOT EVEN ACTURALLY EXISTS I'M SURE SOME ONE PUT IN THE COMMENTS EXAMPLES OR THIS ACTIHE EXISTS MORE OFTEN THAN NOT WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXTREME VIRTUOSITY IN A GIVEN AREA PUT MANY MANY YEARS INTO DEVELOPING THE BASIC SUBSTRATES THE BASIC BUILDING BLOCKS OF WHATEVER IT IS THEIR CRAFT HAPPENS TO BE WHERE THEY DEMONSTRATE VIRTUOSITY THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND NONE THE LESS DIVERGEN THINKING IS THE CRITICAL ELEMENT FOR INITIATING THE CREATIVE PROCESS AGAIN THINKING ABOUT CREATIVITY AS A VERB AND DIVERGENT THINKING INVOLVES TAKING SOME STARTING POINT IN THIS CASE OF PEN AND THEN RADIATING OUT FROM THAT IN A FAIRLY UNCONSTRAINED WHAT BIOLGOS CALL A RANDOM WALK JUST KIND OF WANDERING THROUGH YOUR THOUGHT SPACE AND MEMORY SPACE ABOUT WHAT COULD BE RELATED TO THIS PEN NOW ON THE FLIPSIDE OF CREATIVITY IS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SPECIFIC COMMINATIONS OF THINGS AND TESTING THOSE TO SEE WHETHER NOT THEY ARE INTERESTING RELEVANT OR DELIGHT US OR OTHER PEOPLE OR SCARE US OR OTHER PEOPLE OR THRILL US OR OTHER PEOPLE IN OTHER WORDS A TESTING OF WHETHER NOT THER SOME FUNDAMENTAL RULE TO EMERGE AGAIN I I'M AN REPEAT THIS MANY MANY TIMES THROUT THIS EPISODE AND I'M NOT GOING TO APOLOGIZED FOR THAT BECAUSE I THINK IT SO IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT CREATIVITY IS NOT JUST NOVEL COMBINATIONS THEYRE NOVEL COMBINATIONS OF THINGS THAT REVEAL SOMETHING FUNDAMENTAL AND THAT OFTEN POP OUT TO US IF NOT EVERY TIME CERTAINLY MOST OF THE TIME THAT WE SEE THAT THING IT ALMOST NEVER SEEMS TO BE THE CASE OF SOMETHING TRULY CREATIVE DULLS IN ITS EXPRESSION AND THAT'S BECAUSE WHAT IT'S REPEATING TO US OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS THIS FUNDAMENTAL RULE THAT NORMALLY WE CAN'T SEE OR HEAR OR EXPERIENCE IN THE ABSENCE OF THIS CREATIVE ACT SO THE SECOND PART OF CREATIVITY WHERE THINGS ARE TESTED AND WHERE TRULY CREATIVE ELEMENTS ARE DISCOVERED IS IN CONVERGENT THINKING AND CONVERGEN THINKING IS AS THE NAMES SUGGESTS JUST THE OPPOSITE OF DIVERGENT THINKING CONVERGEN THINKING WOULD BE FOR EXAMPLE IF I GIVE YOU AN IMAGE OR I TELL YOU THE FALLOWING THINGS I SAY WING WATER AN ENGINE THE CONCEPT THAT I HAPPEN HAVE IN MIND IS THAT OF A PLAIN THAT CAN LAND ON WATER  MOST PLAINS DON'T LAND ON WATER OR NOT INTENDED TO LAND ON WATER ONE WOULD HOPE THAT THEIR PLAIN DOESN'T LAND ON WATER UNLESS IT'S A PLAIN DESINE TO LAND ON WATER BUT IN THIS CASE A PLAN THAT CAN LAND ON WATER IS ONE OF THE VERY FEW ANSWERS THAT CAN COMBINE WING WATER AN ENGINE I'M SURE THERE ARE OTHER ANSWERS THEIR OTHER CONVERGNT THINKING MODES THAT CAN TAKE YOU TO AN ANSWER THAT WOULD BE VALID BUT THERE ARE NOT MANY AND HERE WHAT'S REALLY MOST IMPORTANT IS THAT I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO SPOOL OUT OR TO RADIATE OUT FROM THESE THREE THINGS RATHER I'M ASKING YOU TO COMBINE THEM IN SOME WAY THAT MAKE SENSE IN THE REAL WORLD THAN INDEED THERE ARE PLANS THAT CAN LAND ON WATER AND WING WATER AN ENGEN COMBINE WITHIN THOSE THINGS THEY ARE FUNDAMENTAL FEATURES THEY ARE IN FACT NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT FOR HAVING A PLAN THAT CAN LAND ON WATER A CAS THET'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF CONVERGENT THINKING AND A CONVERGEN THINKING TASK WOULD INVOLVE YOU BEING GIVEN A LIST OF TWO OR THREE OR MAY BEVEN FIVE DIFFERENT THINGS AND THEN FOR EACH OF THOSE TWO OR THREE OR FIVE DIFFERENT THINGS AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN TO COME UP WITH A SINGLE ANSWER THAT BINDS ALL OF THOSE IN A REAL WORLD CONCEPT THAT OBEY THE LAWS OF NATURE OR PHYSICS IN SOME WAY FOR INSTANCE YOU COAN JUST COME UP WITH SOME I YOU NOANSWER THAT SAID A A BIRD THAT ON SWALLOWED AN ENGINE AND THAT HAPPENS TO BE A SEA BIRD YET YOU COULD COME UP WITH THAT BUT THAT ACTUALLY IS NOT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS OR IS AT H VERY TYPICAL AT ALL AND SO IT SEEMS LIKE KIND OF A A MISHMASH OF THINGS THAT ARE REALLY JUST DESYIN FOR YOU TO TRY AN ACCOMPLISH AN ANSWER RATHER THAN SOMETHING REAL SUCH AS A PLAIN THAT LANDS ON WATER OKE THE POINT HERE IS THAT DIVERGENT THINKING IS ONE ASPECT OF OUR COGNITION OF OR THINKING AND CONVERGENT THINKING IS A VERY DISTINCT ASPECT OF OUR COGNITION IN FACT ONE OF THE CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CONVERGENT THINKING IS ALSO TO ACCESS OUR MEMORY BANKS AND ARE UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE OUTSIDE WORLD JUST AS IT WERE WITH DIVERGENT THINKING BUT IT REQUIRES MORE FOCUS AND MORE PERSISTENCE IN FACT IF WE WERE TO COME UP WITH A KEY RULE FOR DIVERGENT THINKING IT WOULD BE YOU ALMOST WANT TO HAVE JUST ENOUGH FOCUST TO REMEMBER WHAT THE INITIAL OBJECT OR THING THAT WAS MENTIONED WAS TO KEEP THAT IN MIND SO THAT YOUR ANSWERS DON'T BECOME COMPLETELY RANDOM BUT THE MORE DISTANT AND EVERYWHERE IN BETWEEN THAT YOU CAN GENERATE ANSWERS THAT IS THE THINGS THAT ARE VERY CLOSE TOPENS YOU KNOW BLACKPEN REDPEN VERSES YOU KNOW PEN AND DOORSTOP PEN ACTING AS A DOORSTOP TOS ZER ONE IS VERY CLOSE REDPEN IS VERY CLOSE TO BLACKPEN DOORSTOP IS PRETTY FAR FROM BLACKPEN SO THAT'S THE IDEAIS THAT YOU WANT TO EXPLORE AND UNDERGO A RANGE OF EXPLORATION OF DIFFERENT IDEAS WHEREAS WITH CONVERGENT THINKING YOU'RE REALLY TRYING TO BIND THESE THINGS TOGETHER AND SO THE KEY ELEMENT FOR CONVERGENT THINKING IS THE ASPECT OF PERSISTENCE AND FOCUS AND THAT'S WHY CONVERGENT THINKING IN MANY WAYS FEELS HARDER THAN DIVERGENT THINKING IT FEELS LIKE THERE'S AN ANSWER AND I WHANT O GET THE ANSWER RIGHT AND I CAN'T SOLVE IT'S A PUZZLE AND IT'S A PUZZLE THAT RELIES ON VERY DISTINCT BRAIN CIRCUITS FROM DIVERGENT THINKING WHICH BRAIN CIRCUITS WELL THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DESCRIBE NEXT AND AGAIN THIS IS NOT JUST GOING TO BE A LIST OF DIFFERENT BRAIN CIRCUITS WITH DIFFERENT NAMES DOING DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WOULDN'T BE USEFUL TO YOU OR TO ME RATHER WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO LEARN IS TRULY INCREDIBLE WHAT IT IS IS WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT ONE SINGLE MOLECULE DOPAMINE WHICH IS A MOLECULE MOST TYPICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH MOTIVATION AND DESIRE AND DRIVE IN FEELINGS OF PLEASURE IN SOME CASES BUT THAT ACTUALLY RESIDES WITHIN FOR DIFFERENT NETWORKS IN THE BRAIN TO DAY WEREGOING TO TALK ABOUT TWO OF THOSE NETWORKS AND DOPAMINE ACTING IN ONE NETWORK DIRECTLY UNDERLIES DIVERGENT THINKING WHEREAS DOPAMINE IN ANOTHER BRAIN NETWORK UNDERLIES CONVERGENT THINKING AND IF AT THIS POINT IN THIS EPISODE YOU TINK O'LL GET WHEN AM I GETN GET THE TOOLS TO UNDERSTAND CREATIVITY AND HOW TO BE CREATIVE WHAT I CAN ASSURE YOU IS THAT IF YOU UNDERSTAND DIVERGENT THINKING WHICH HOPFALLY NOW YOU DO AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT CONVERGENT THINKING IS AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT DOPAMINE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BOTH DIVERGENT THINKING AND CONVERGENT THINKING BUT THROUGH SEPARATE PATHWAYS WELL T EN IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND HOW THOSE TWO SEPARATE PATHWAYS WORK AND HOW TO ENGAGE THEM DIFFERENTIALLY THEREIN LIE THE TOOLS THAT YOU CAN USE BOTH TO EXPLORE IDEAS IN OTHER WORDS FIND WHAT IT IS THAT COULD BE CREATIVE AND THEN SYSTEMATICALLY TEST EACH OF THOSE IDEAS FOR WHAT IS TRULY CREATIVE THAT IS WHAT MEETS THE CRITERIA FOR SOMETHING THAT IS NOVEL ANDTRULY USEFUL AND INFORMS US ABOUT SOMETHING THAT WE'VE NEVER SEEN HEARD OR FELT BEFORE TET'S JTUST TAKE A MOMENT TO TALK ABOUT THE INCREDIBLE MOLECULE THAT IS DOPAMINE MANY PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH DOPAMINE FROM THE CONCEPT OF QUOTIN Q DOPAMINE HITS WHICH IS POPULAR LANGUAGE DESCRIBING THE FEELING OF PLEASURE THAT WE GET FROM PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING THAT WE LIKEER THAT WE CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN REPEATEDLY SO SOME PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE DOPAMINE HIT THAT THEY GET FROM SOMEBODY ATTRACTIVE THAT THEY LIKE TEXING THEM BACK OR THE DOPAMINE HIT THAT THEY GET FROM SOCIAL MEDEO THE DOPAMINE HIT THAT THEY GET FROM SUGAR OR THE DOPAMINE HITHAT THEY GET FROM THIS OR FROM THAT TO BE ONEST THE CONCEPT OF DOPAMINE HITS IS NOT ONE THAT I FAVOR BECAUSE IN GENERAL WHENEVER PEOPLE TALK ABOUT DOPAMINE HITS TYPICALLY THEIR TALKING ABOUT ACTIVITIES SUCH AS SOCIAL MEDIA WHICH DOPAMINE MAY BE INVOLVED AT SOME LEVEL BUT OFTEN IT'S THE CASE THAT THE BEHAVIOR ASSOCIATE WITH THAT THING IN THIS CASE SOCIAL MEDIA IS MORE OF THE COMPULSIVE NATURE RATHER THAN AN ACTIVE SEEKING OF SOMETHING WITH POSITIVE ANTICIPATION AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT DOPAMINE IS ABOUT AT LEAST IN THE CONTEXT OF ONE OF ITS MAJOR FUNCTIONS IN THE BRAIN DOPAMINE IS REALLY ABOUT MOTIVATION AND DESIRE AND MOVEMENT AND IT MAKE SENSE WHY MOTIVATION DESIRE AND MOVEMENT WOULD BE LINKED UP THROUGH A COMMON IN THIS CASE NEUROMODULATOR CHEMICAL LIKE DOPAMINE BECAUSE THROUGHOUT EVOLUTION IF WE WERE EXCITED FOR OR MOTIVATED TO PURSUE SOMETHING WE HAD TO MOVE IN ORDER TO GET IT TO OBTAIN IT AND IN GENERAL WE CAN FRAME DOPAMINE UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF DOPAMINE TENDS TO BE INVOLVED IN NERL CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN THAT ARE INVOLVED IN PROCESSES THAT ARE TAKING US BEYOND THE CONFINES OF OUR SKIN THAT IS THAT MOTIVATE US TO GO DO SOMETHING IN TERMS OF ACTION IN THE WORLD NOW THAT STATEMENT MIGHT SEEM DISTANTLY PLACED FROM A DISCUSSION ABOUT CREATIVITY BUT IS WILL LEARN A LOBIT LATOR ONE OF THE MOST USEFUL TOOLS FOR ENGAGING CREATIVITY AND BECOMING MORE CREATIVE IS TO THINK ABOUT ACTION ELEMENTS WITHIN A NARRATIVE THAT IS THINGS THAT WE AND OTHERS CAN DO IN ORDER TO DISCOVER NEW RULES THROUGH ACTUAL MOVEMENT THAT'S A LOBIC CRYPTIC A FORGIVE ME BUT I PROMISE I'LL RETURN TO IT LATER AND I WILL MAKE IT CRYSTAL CLEAR THEREARE FOR MAJOR CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN THAT USE DOPAMINE ALTHOUGH I SHOULD MENTION THERE ARE ADDITIONAL CIRCUITS AS WELL IN FACT YOUR IY EVEN CONTAIN ZNERANS THAT RELEASE DOPAMING THAT CONTROL THE SENSITIVITY OF YOUR EYE DIFFERENT TIMES OF DAY DELIGHT ET CETERA THE FOR MAJOR CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN THAT YOU LIES DOPAMINE HOWEVER ARE USED FOR FOR MAJOR PURPOSES AND I'LL DESCRIBE WHAT THOSE ARE FIRST OF ALL IS A NERAL CIRCUIT THAT USES DO POMENE AMONG OTHER THINGS BUT CERTAINLY REALIZE ON DOPOMINE IN A CRITICAL WAY TO ENGAGE MOVEMENT INCLUDING IVE MOVEMENTS AND WE WILL RETURN TO IVE MOVEMENTS WHY THEY'ARE SO IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING CREATIVITY MAY BE EVEN FOR GENERATING CREATIVITY A LITTLE BIT LATER THE NAME OF THE CIRCUIT AGAIN IS LESS IMPORTANT THAN WHAT IT DOES BUT THE NAME OF THE CIRCUIT FOR THOSE THAT WANT TO KNOW IS THE SO CALLED NIGRO STRITAL PATHWAY CAVE THE SUBSTANTIAL NIGRA IS A BRAIN AREA THAT IS VERY DARK THAT PROJECTS TO AN AREA CALLED THE DORSAL STRIATUM TAT CONTAINS A MUNCH OF SUBREGON SO AGAIN FOR THOSE AOR YOU THAT REALLY GEEK OUT ON THE STUFF GREAT YOU CAN LEARN THESE NAMES AND RETAIN THEM IN YOUR MEMORY IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT NAMES DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT JUST DISCARD THE NAMES BUT AREAS OF THE BRAIN LIKE THE COTDY AND PEUTANUM IN THE DORSAL STRIDE AND RECEIVE IN PUT FROM THE SUBSTANTIANIGRA IN NURANATOMY WHEN WE NAME SOMETHING WE SAY THE ORIGIN OF THAT THING AND WERE IT CONNECTS THROUGH SO NIGRO STRITAL TELLS YOU THAT THERE IS A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SUBSTANTIAL NIGRA CAUSE IT CAME FIRST NIGROSTRIDLE AND THEN STRITALES WHERE IT ENDS UP SO NIGROSTRITAL PATHWAY IS INVOLVED IN GENERATING BODILY MOVEMENTS IT'S INVOLVED IN E MOVEMENTS AND IT IS ACTUALLY A BRAIN AREA THAT'S ENGAGED WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT MOVEMENT EVEN JUST HAVE A STORY IN YOUR MIND ABOUT WALKING OR A STORYING YOUR MIND ABOUT RUNNING ERE STORING YOUR MIND ABOUT DRIVING THIS AREA IS ENGAGED VERY INTERESTING BRAIN AREA I SO THAT'S THE FIRST CIRCUIT VERY IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND ND ALLTIL YOU RIGHT NOW THAT IS THE BRAIN CIRCUIT THAT IS ENGAGED WHEN YOU UNDERGO DIVERGENT THINKING NW THAT ITSELF SHOULD BE INTERESTING RIGHT EVEN IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER ANY OF THE NAMES OF THE THINGS I JUST TOLD YOU THAT YOU HAVE A BRAIN CIRCUIT THAT EVEN IF YOU JUST THINK ABOUT WALKING IT BECOMES MORE ACTIVE AND THE DOPAMINE IS INVOLVED IN THAT BRAIN ACTIVITY AND IF YOU RECALL DIVERGENT THINKING INVOLVES TAKING A CONCEPT AS BORING AS A PEN AND THINKING ABOUT OTHER CONCEPTS THAT COULD LINK UP WITH THAT PEN IN SOME SORT OF WAY LOGICAL OR ILLOGICAL RIGHT THE BRIDGE COULD BE COMPLETELY ABSTRACTING AND REALLY FANTASTICAL WITH A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT IDEAS IN BETWEEN LIKE A PEN ACTING AS THE DOOR STOP BECAUSE OF SOME SITUATION WE OU NEED O RUN DOWN STAIRS IN A FIRE AND GET BACK UPSTAIRS QUICKLY TO RESCUE SOMEBODY VERY DIVERGENT OR IS DIVERGENT AS BLACKPEN TO RED PEN BUT WHAT'S AMAZING IS THAT THAT SAME CIRCUIT IS THE ONE THAT'S INVOLVED IN PHYSICAL MOVEMENT IN GENERATING AND THINKING ABOUT PHYSICAL MOVEMENT THAT TURNS OUT TO BE VITALLY IMPORTANT FOR TAPPING INTO THE CREATIVITY PROCESS O REALLY FRAME THAT UP IN YOUR MIND OR COMMIT ED TO MEMORY NOW THE SECOND DOPAMINE CIRCUIT ASSOCIATE WITH CREATIVITY IS THE ONE ASSOCIATE WITH CONVERGENT THINKING WHICH AGAIN IS THE KIND OF THINKING WHERE THERE'S A SPECIFIC CORRECT ANSWER IT REQUIRES FOCUS AND IT REQUIRES PERSISTENCE AND THE NAME OF THAT CIRCUIT AGAIN THE NAME ISN'TIS IMPORTANT AS WHAT IT DOES BUT THE NAME OF THAT CIRCUIT IS THE MESO CORTICAL PATHWAY THE MESICORTICAL PATHWAY IS INVOLVED IN MOTIVATION AND IT HAS AN EMOTIONAL COMPONENT TO NOW IT WE COME CLEAR IN A FEW MINUTES WHY THAT EMOTIONAL COMPONENT IS VIT L BUT THIS IS A CIRCUIT THAT ORIGINATES IN A BRAIN STRUCTURE CALLED THE LATERAL VENTUAL TAGMENTAL AREA AGAIN ABUNCH OF WORDS YOU CAN REMEMBERED IF YOU WANT LATTER OF VEN VENTURAL TEGMENTAL AREA OR YOU CAN NOT WORRY ABOUT THE NAME AND IT CONNECTS TO THE PREFRUNTAL QUARTECS THAT AREA JUST BEHIND THE FOREHEAD AND THIS MESOCORTICAL AREA IS INVOLVED EMOTIVATION AND EMOTION AND IS CRITICAL FOR FOCUS AND PERSISTENCE IT IS DISTINCT FROM A VERY NEARBIAREA JUST SITTING RIGHT NEXT DOOR THE SO CALED MESO LYMBIC AREA WHICH IS INVOLVED IN DESIRE AND FEELINGS OF REWARD AND THIS IS THE AREA THAT IS ASSOCIATE MORE TYPICALLY WITH A DICTIVE BEHAVIORS OR COMPULSIVE BEHAVIORS WE'RE GON TO LEAVE OUT THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE MESOLYMBIC PATHWAY FOR NOW BECAUSE IT'S NOT CRITICAL TO DIVERGENT OR CONVERGEN THINKING AND IT'S NOT CRITICAL TO THE PROCESS OF CREATIVITY AT LEAST AS FAR AS WE KNOW BUT I MENTION IT BECAUSE IT IS THE THIRD IN THE FOR DOPAMANURGIC CIRCUITS AND THEN THE FOURTH CIRCUIT CERTAINLY ONE I'VE NEVER TALKED ABUT BEFOR IN THIS PODCAST WHICH IS DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING EXCEPT THAT WE HAVEN'T GOTTINTO IT YET IS THE TUBOREAU INFRONDIBULAR PATHWAY AND THAT IS THE PATHWAY ASSOCIAE WITH DOPAMINE AND YOUR PETUITARY GLAND AND THE RELEASE OF HORMONES IN PARTICULAR THAT TRAVEL TO THE OVERY IF YOU HAVE OVERIES OR TO YOUR TESTES IF YOU HAVE TESTES AND TRIGGER THE RELEASE OF THINGS LIKE ESTEROGEN AND TESTOSTERONE ET CETERA DOPAMINE IS INTIMATELY INVOLVED IN THAT CIRCUITRY AGAIN NOT THE TOPIC OF TODAY'S DISCUSSION FOR TO DAY'S DISCUSSION WE WANT TO REMEMBER THAT THERE'S A DOPAMINE CIRCUIT CALLED THE NIGRISSTRATAL CIRCUIT WHICH IS INVOLVED IN MOVEMENT AND DIVERGENT THINKING AND THAT ALONE SHOULD SET A FLAG UP FOR YOU LIKE WOW JUST THINKING ABOUT NEW IDEAS HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH MOVEMENT WITH PHYSICAL MOVEMENT AND THE DOPAMINE CIRCUIT THAT IS THE MESOCORTICAL PATHWAY WHICH IS THE ONE THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH MOTIVATION AND EMOTION AND THAT'S THE ONE REQUIRED FOR PERSISTENCE IN FOCUS FOR CONVERGENT THINKING WHY AM I TELLING YOU ALL OF THIS ABOUT DOPAMI WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT DOPAMINE CREATES A CERTAIN NUMBER OF RESPONSES IN THE BRAIN AND BODY WHEN IT IS ACTIVE IN ONE OR THE OTHER OF THESE CIRCUITS AND JUST FORSAKE OF SIMPLICITY SO I DON'T HAVE TO KEEP SAYING NIGROSAREATAL AND MESO CORTICAL HERE GOING FORWARD I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE DOPAMINE CIRCUIT THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH DIVERGEN THINKING OR THE DOPAMENE CIRCUIT ASSOCIATE WITH CONVERGENT THINKING AND AGAIN DIVERGEN THINKING IN CONVRGEN THINK ARE THE TWO PROCESSES THAT HAVE TO OCCUR USUALLY FIRST DIVERGENT THEN CIVE CONVERGEN THINKING THEM BACK AND FORTH AND BACK ND FORTH IN ORDER TO ARRIVE AT SOMETHING CREATIVE DIVERGEN THINKING IS ABOUT EXPLORATION CONVERGEN THINKING IS ABOUT TESTING THINGS IN COMING UP WITH THINGS THAT ARE THE RIGHT ANSWER THAT FEEL RIGHT AND WE WILL BETTER TO FIND WHAT RIGHT MEANS A LITTLE BIT LATER BUT YOU ALREADY SORT OF NO RIGHT IN THIS CONTEXT IS WHEN YOU HAVE SOME COMBINATION OF ELEMENTS OR SOME IDEA OR SOME WRITTEN PASSAGE OR SOME MUSIC OR SOME PHYSICAL ACTION THAT YOU JUST NOW THIS IS R EALLY NOVEL AND REALLY COOL OR PEOPLE SEE IT OR HEAR IT OR TASTE IT AND SAY THIS IS REALLY NOVEL AND REALLY COOL AND THEY DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW WHY IT'S JUST DIFFERENT IN A WAY THAT FEELS TRUE NOW I REALIZE THAT FOR SOME OF YOU LISTENING TO THIS EPISODE WE ARE PROBABLY AT THE POINT ALONG THE PATHWAY OF CONCEPT IN DEFINITION IN MECHANISM THAT LEAVES YOU IN A PLACE OF REAL WANTING A TOOL AND SO I PROMISE THAT I AM GOING TO GET INTO MORE TOOLS BUT TO SATISFY YOU AND TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DO INDEED UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE TOOLS THAT CAN EMERGE FROM THE INFORMATION THAT YOU ALREADY NOW HAVE IN MIND I DO ONE A SHARE WITH YOU ONE PARTICULAR TOOL FROM THEIR LITERATURE THAT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO SUPPORT AND BILD AND ENHANCE DIVERGENT THINKING AND I ALSO ONE A SHARE WITH YOU A TOOL THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN FROM THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE TO ENHANCE CONVERGENT THINKING BECAUSE BOTH CONVERGENT AND DIVERGENT THINKING ARE CRITICAL FOR THE CREATIVE PROCESS NOW I SHOULD EMPHASIZE THAT SOME PEOPL OUT THERE EITHER BY TRAINING ORE BY CENETICS OR BY BOTH WILL BE NATURALLY BETTER AT DIVERGENT ARE CONVERGENT THINKING AND IN FACT WE NOW KNOW IN A KIND OF ALMOST POETIC KIND OF WAY THAT NATURALLY OCCURRING VARIATIONS IN GENES WHICH UNDERLIE NATURALLY OCCURRING VARIATIONS IN THE PERCENTAGE OF DOPAMINE IN ONE SET OF BRAIN CIRCUITS VERSES ANOTHER DO SEEM TO RELATE TO WHETHER R NOT PEOPLE ARE NATURALLY GOOD AT DIVERGENT THINKING OR CONVERGENT THINKING NOW THAT'S A VERY NATURE BASED EXPLANATION FOR WHY SOME PEOPLE ARE BETTER DIVERGENT THINKING ANOTHER PEOPLE ARE BETTER CONVERGENT THINKING NATURE AND NURTURE IS SOMETHING THAT CAN NEVER REALLY BE TEASED APART EXACTLY BECAUSE OF COURSE IF SOME ONE HAS A NATURAL PROCLIVITY FOR SOMETHING BASED ON THEIR GENES YOU CAN'T OFTEN SEPARATE THAT FROM THEIR PARENTS BECAUSE WE INHERIT OUR GENES FROM OUR PARENTS ALTHOUGH EVEN IN CASES WHERE PEOPLE ARE RAISED AWAY FROM THEIR PARENTS THROUGH ADOPTION ET CETERA IT'S VERY HARD TO SEPARATE NATURE IN NURTURE BECAUSE SOMEBODY WITH A NATURAL PROCLIVITY FOR THINGS MIGHT ENGAGE IN THOSE THINGS MORE ET CETERA ET CETERA THE POINT IS THAT FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE VERY VERY GOOD AT DIVERGENT THINKING OR VERY VERY GOOD AT CONVERGENT THINKING SOME OF THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN INHERITED BUT MORE THAN LIKELY SOME OF THAT DEPENDED ON THE KINDS OF ACTIVITIES THAT YOU ENGAGED IN IN YOUR EARLYLY YEARS IN PARTICULAR IN THE YEARS BETWEEN AGE FIVE AND TWENTY FIVE AND FOR THOSE YOU THAT ARE AGED BETWEEN FIVE AND TWENTY FIVE ALL I CAN SAY IS PLEASE LEARN TO ENGAGE BOTH DIVERGENT CAN CONVERGENT THINKING AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE YOU WILL ENHANCE YOUR ABILITY FOR BOTH FOR THOSE OF YOU TWENTY FIVE AND OLDER YOU CAN STILL ENHANCE YOUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE DIVERGENT IN CONVERGENT THINKING AND THE FORTUNATE NEWS THE EQUALIZER I SHOULD SAY IS THAT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT YOUOU ARE NATURALLY BETTER DIVERGENT O CONVERGEN THINKING OR YOU REQUIRED IT THROUGH ACTIVITIES YOU NEED BOTH IN ORDER TO BE CREATIVE SO WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT IN ORDER TO ENGAGE DIVERGENT THINKING WE NEED ACCESS TO OUR MEMORY BANKS WE NEED TO COME UP WITH POSSIBILITIES AND THOSE POSSIBILITIES CAN ONLY COME FROM WHAT'S CONTAIN WITHIN OUR MEMORY SYSTEMS OF OUR BRAIN ERIES LIKE THE HIPOCAMPAS ET CETERA BUT THE NAMES AGAIN DON'T MATTER WE JUST KNOW THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO COME UP WITH NOVEL COMMINATIONS OF THINGS ARE NOVEL USES OF THINGS OR TOTALLY NEW IDEAS ABOUT HOW OBJECTS OR NOTES OF MUSIC ARE FOODS OR TASTES OR WHATEVER CAN BE COMBINED WE HAVE TO DO THAT WITH PRE EXISTING KNOWLEDGE AND YET WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO ENGAGE DIVERGENT THINKING IS SUPPRESS WHAT IS CALLED AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL NARRATIVES AND IN PARTICULAR AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL NARATIVES WE NEED TO DISCARD WITH JUDGMENTS ABOUT HOW CERTAIN COMMINATIONS OF THINGS IMPACTED US IN THE PASS THIS IT I THINK IS WHAT PEOPLE MEAN WHEN THEY ENCOURAGE THE EXPLORATION OF CREATIVITY BY SO CALLED BOUNDARY EXPLORATION HERE ABOUT THIS ALLOT AND CON OF THE SELF HELP AND PSYCHOLOGY LITERATURE AND I'M NOT AT ALL DISPARAGING OF THE LITERATURE ALTHOUGH RARELY DOES IT DEFINE EXACTLY HOW AND WHY TO GO ABOUT BEING MORE CREATIVE IN THE OR IN THIS CASE TO BE A MORE DIVERGENT IN OUR THINKING SO THEY'LL SAY YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO TAKE RISKS OR YOU HAVE TO A SUPPRESS JUDGMENT HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY DO THAT OR THERE'S A WONDERFUL PAPER THAT TALKS ABOUT ONE WAY TO DO IT ONE WAY TO DO IT IS WHAT'S CALLED OPEN MONITERING MEDITATION OR EVEN JUST OPEN MONITORING THINKING AND JUST TO MAKE WHAT COULD OTHERWISE BE A SOME A SOMEWHAT COMPLEX SECTION HERE VERY SIMPLE WHAT I'LL ALSO TELL YOU IS THAT IF YOU WANT TO ENHANTS CONVERGEN THINKING YOU CAN DO THAT A NUMBER OF WAYS BUT YOU CAN DO THAT IN PARTICULAR BUT DOING A DIFFERENT TYPE OF MEDITATION OR THOUGHT PROCESS WHICH IS CALLED FOCUST ATTENTION MEDITATION SO TLET'S TALK ABOUT OPEN MONITRING MEDITATION WHY IT'S SO USEFUL FOR ENHANCING DIVERGENT THINKING THIS CRITICAL ELEMENT OF THE CREATIVE PROCESS FIRST OF ALL OPEN MONETORING MEDITATION AND FOCUST ATTENTION MEDITATION CAN BE PERFORMED THE EXACT SAME WAY PHYSICALLY IT CAN SIT THERE EYES CLOSE I DON'T CARE FOYOUR IN A LODISPOSITION IT DOESN'TREALLY MATTER YOURE LYING DOWN YOU'RE STANDING UP YOU COULD IN THEORY DO OPEN MONERING MEDITATION WITH EYES OPEN AND THAT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING VARIANT ON IT BUT FOR SAKE OF A THE DISCUSSION RIGHT NOW LETC HUST FOCUS ON THE STUDY THAT TALKS ABOUT THE SPECIFIC TOOLS AND THE WAY THAT THEY WERE USED IN THE STUDY THE TITLE OF THE PAPER THAT I'M ESSENTIALLY SUMMARISING IS CALLED OPEN MNITORING MEDITATION REDUCES THE INVOLVEMINT OF BRAIN REGIONS RELATED TO MEMORY FUNCTION NOW RIGHT OFF THE BAT THAT SHOULD CURE YOU TO SOMETHING INTERESTING SOMETHING ABOUT DIVERGENT THINKING IN OPEN MONITERING IS RELATED TO SUPPRESSING MEMORY BAT AS YOU RECALL JUST A FEW MOMENTS AGO I SAID THAT IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN DIVERGENT THINKING YOU NEED TO AND O KILL OFF THE NARRATIVES OF WHAT HAS TO BE RELATED TO WHAT AND COME UP WITH NEW NARRATIVES YOU STILL NEED TO UNDERSTAND POSSIBILITIES BUT YOU NEED TO FORGET PRIOR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THOSE POSSIBILITIES HAVE TO BE AND START THING ABOUT WHAT THOSE POSSIBILITIES COULD BE AND SO THAT IT TURNS OUT INVL L SUPPRESSION A CERTAIN BRAIN AREAS OPEN MNERING MEDITATION IS TYPICALY DONE FOR ABOUT TEN TO THIRTY MINUTES ALTHOUGH IT COULD BE LONGER AND UNLIKE OTHER FORMS OF MEDITATION WHERE YOU SIT AND CONCENTRATE ON YOUR BREATHING AND TRYING TO REDIRECT YOUR THINKING BACK TO YOUR BREATHING OR TO YOUR POSTURE OR TO A A CHANT OR A MONTRA OPEN MONERING MEDITATION IS SIMPLY A MATTER OF HAVING YOU SIT THERE OR LIE DOWN CLOSE YOUR EYE AND TO ALLOW WHATEVER SURFACES IN YOUR MIND TO SURFACE AND WHAT YOU PRACTICE IS THE PRACTICE OF NON JUDGMENT NOW NON JUDGEMENT ITSELF IS A LOBIT OF AN EPISTRACT THEME BECAUSE OF COURSE THE MOMEN YOU SAY DON'T JUDGE YOU AND OTHERS START TO JUDGE IS JUST THE WAY THAT THE BRAIN WORKS YOU SAY DON'T THINK ABOUT AN ELEPHANT YOU THIN ABOUT AN ELEPHANT THAT'S A PERFECTLY NATURAL YOU GO TO AAN EDGE OF A A BRIDGE OR A CLIFF AND YOU THINK ABOUT JUMPHING OFF IN THOUGH YOU DON'T PLEASE DON'T JUMP OFF AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S PART OF THE CIRCUITORY THAT'S KEEPING YOU FROM JUMPING OFF AS THE THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU DID  SO OPEN MONERING MEDITATION INVOLVES DEDICATING A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME WHERE YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES AND WHATEVER THOUGHTS ARISE WHATEVER EMOTIONS AR EYES WHATEVER IDEAS ARESE TO WATCH THOSE AND TAKE AN INVENTORY OF THEM TO JUST MERELY WATCH THEM SHOW UP AND PASS OR MAY BE BECOME FIXATED ON THEM FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME OR MAY BEVEN JUST ONE FOR A LONG PERIT OF TIME ALL OF THAT IS FINE IN OTHER WORDS WHATEVER SURFACES SURFACES THAT'S OPEN MONERING MEDITATION AND THAT WE KNOW FROM BRAIN IMAGING STUDIES AND WE KNOW FROM MEASUREMENTS OF DOPEMIN AND PARTICULAR BRAIN CIRCUITS AND WE KNOW FROM PEOPLE WHO TRAIN WITH OPEN MONERING MEDITATION ON A REGULAR BASIS IMPROVES DIVERGENT THINKING CAPABILITY SO IN TERMS OF TOOLS PRACTICING OPEN MONERING MEDITATION OR WHAT I WOULD JUST CALL OPEN MONERING THINKING IS GOING TO BE IMMENSELY USEFUL AND THIS IS ACTIN OPPORTUNITY CEW UP SOMETHIN THAT I MENTION IN OUR EPISODE ON MEDITATION WHICH GOES DEEP INTO THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MEDITATION INVOLVING FOCUS INWARD AND OUTWARD ET CETERA YOU'RE WELCOME TO CHECK OUT THAT EPISODE ITS A HUBERMAN LABEDOT COME BUT THE POINT IS THAT RATHER THAN THINK ABOUT THE WORD MEDITATION WHICH CARRIES A BUNCH OF IDEAS ABOUT WHAT IT IS AND WHAT IT ISN'T AND HOW TO DO IT MEDITATION IS REALLY JUST A PERCEPTIONAL EXERCISE FOR INSTANCE YOU COULD DO A MEDITATION WHERE YOU LOOK AT A SINGLE POINT ON A WALL FOR FIVE MINUTES AND REDIRECT YOUR FOCUS TO THAT SINGLE POINT ON A WALL OVER AND OVER AGAIN EVERY TIME YOUR MIND DRIFTS AS IT NO DOUBT WOULD OR TO A TONE IN THE ROOM YOU CAND ATTEND TO THAT AND REDIRECT TO THAT RATHER THING ABOUT AS A MEDITATION'S REALLY JUST A PERCEPTIOAL EXERCISE THAT'S ALL THAT MEDITATION IS SO OPEN MONETERING MEDITATION IS REALLY JUST A FORM OF PERCEPTION WHERE YOUR PAYING ATTENTION YOUR PERCEIVING YOUR THOUGHTS WITHOUT LAING JUDGEMENT TO THOSE THOUGHTS OR TRYING NOT TO LAY JUDGMENT TO THOSE THOUGHTS AND WHAT PEOPLE FIND IS THAT THEY VERY QUICKLY WITHIN A FEW DAYS GET BETTER AT DOING OPEN MONERING MEDITATION AND FORTUNATELY WITHIN IT JUST A FEW DAYS AND CERTAINLY WITHIN ABOUT A WEEK OR MORE OF PRACTICE AND IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO BE DAILY PRACTICE O ALTHOUGH OF COURSE DAILY PRACTICE WILL EX ELERATE THE PROCESS FURTHER PEOPLE BECOME SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER AT DIVERGENT THINKING ND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE DOPAMING CIRCUITS AND IN PARTICULAR ALONG THE NIGRESSORATOL PACK PATHWAY BECOMING MORE ACTIVE AND THE WONDERFUL THING IS THAT WHEN YOU REPEAT A PRACTIS AND A PARTICULAR NURRL CIRCUIT IS ENGAGE OVER AND OVER AGAIN DELIBERATELY THAT NARRL CIRCUIT BECOMES EASIER TO ENGAGE SO CALLED NURRO PLASTICITY SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE ANY OF YOU THAT WANT TO EXPLORE THE CREATIVE PROCESS FOR WHATEVER REASON OR GET BETTER THE CREATIVE PROCESS DEDICATE SOME AMOUNT OF TIME MAYBEVEN JUST FIVE MINUTES EVERY OTHER DAY TO DOING THIS OPEN MONITERING MEDITATION I'VE TRIED THIS MEDITATION ITS ACTUALLY QUITE FUN TO DOU BECAUSE AT LEAST TO ME IT FEELS A LOT EASIER THAND THE MEDITATION ASSOCIATED WITH CONVERGEN THINKING NOW THE CONVERGEN THINKING MEDITATION IS HE SO CALED FOCUS ATTENTION MEDITATION AND THAT'S ALSO DESCRIBED IN THE SAME STUDY AND OTHER STUDIES OFE EXPLORED WHICH PARTICULAR BRAIN NET WORKS IT INVOLVES AND I CAN JUST TELL YOU THAT FOCUS ATTENTION MEDITATION WHICH YOU CAN THINK OF OR I'D PREFER THAT YOU THINK OF JUST AS A PERCEPTIOALE EXERCISE INVOLVES SITTING OR LYING DOWN CLOSING YOUR EYES FOCUSSING EITHER ON YOUR BREATH OR SOME ELEMENT OF YOUR BODY COULD BE A THE ON THE TOPS OF YUR KNEES OR THE CLASP OF YOUR HANDS IT COULD BE FOCUSING ON AN AUDITORY TONE YOU COUL EVEN DO IT EYES OPEN AND STERE IT OF A POINT ON A WALL OR A FLAME OF LIGHT WHAT IT WHATEVER IT HAPPENS TO BE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO REDIRECT YOUR FOCUS TO A PARTICULAR LOCATION OR IDEA OR SOUND THAT IS KNOWN TO IMPROVE YOUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE CONVERGENT THINKING TO QUICKLY PARSE THROUGH OR ANALYZE A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT CHOICES AND TO PERSIST IN CHOICE SELECTION AND THEREFORE MORE RAPIDLY ARRIVE AT THE CORRECT ANSWER THIS IS WELL ESTABLISHED IN IN FACT IN THE EPISODE TH I DID WITH A WONDERFUL GUESS DOCTOR WHENDY SEZUKI FROM NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SHE TALKED ABOUT HOW A DAILY MEDITATION OF ABOUT TEN TO THIRTEEN MINUTES PERFORMED FOR ABOUT A WEEKS THAT' WHAT HE EXPLORED THAT STUDY GREATLY INCREASES PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO FOCUS AND IN FACT THEIR MEMORY AND THAT'S EXACTLY THE POINT WHICH IS THAT CONERGENT THINKING AS I MENTION BEFORE IT REQUIRES PERSISTENCE FOCUS AN ACCESS TO SPECIFIC MEMORIES SO IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO GET BETTER FOCUSSING THAT IS THE MEDITATION FOR YOU HOWEVER BECAUSE TO DAY WERE TALKING BOUT CREATIVITY IF YOU ARE SOMEODY WANTS TO GET BETTER DIVERGENT THINKING ANY CONVERGEN THINKING THE TWO ELEMENTS OF CREATIVITY THAT IS I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO DOU A DUEL MEDITATION THAT IS A MEDITATION THAT STARTS WITH OPEN MONITORING FOR MAYBE FIVE TO TEN MINUTES AND THEN TRANSITIONS TO FOCUS ATTENTION FOR MAYBE FIVE TO TEN MINUTES BECAUSE THE POSITIONING OF DIVERGENT THINKING AND THEN CONVERGEN THINKING CLOSE TOGETHER MORE CLOSELY RESEMBLES WHAT THE CREATIVE PROCESS REALLY IS AND WHAT IT TYPICALLY INVOLVES MOST OF US WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A SITUATION WHERE WE CAN SPEND A MORNING OR A DAY OR A WEEK BRAINST ORMING JUST KIND OF BRAIN THRORINGWHATEVER WE THINK ABOUT IS FINE THAT'S DIVERGEN THINKING WHATEVER ELEMENTS JUST THROW THEM UP ON THE WHITE BOARD WE SOMETIMES SEE PEOPL AND COMPANIES DOING THIS AT RETREATS YOU BRICTIN PEOPLE INTO A NOVEL ENVIRONMENT SEYLITS JUST FORGET ALL THE RULES UNLESS JUST COME UP WITH NEW IDEAS ABOUT SOME THING NEW NEW USES OF SOMETHING NEW STRATEGIES IN YOU AND NOTHING IS TOO CRASY NOTHINGIS OFF LIMITS AND SURE THAT'S A A USEFUL EXTION I SO CALLED BRAIN STORMING BUT AT SOME POINT THERE'S THE REQUIREMENT TO CROSS OFF THINGS AND TIICALLY THAT'S DONE LATER IN THE RETREAT OR LATER IN THE MEETING OR LATER IN THE WEEKAND AND THAT'S A WONDERFUL WAY TO APPROACH CREATIVITY INTO TRY AND BE CREATIVE BUT NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE TRAIN FOR THAT ON A REGULAR BASIS O WHAT I JUST DESCRIBE TO YOU ARE RESEARCH TESTED TOOLS FOR TRAINING FOR DIVERGEN THINKING IN CONVERGEN THINKING AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN BEING MORE CREATIVE TO TRY AND DO THESE ON A SOMEWHAT REGULAR BASIS IF NOT EVERY DAY THAN CERTAINLY A FEW TIMES A WEEK OR MORE CERTAINLY THE MORE YOU DO IT THE BETTER YOU'RE GOING TO GET IT THAT'S WELL DEMONSTRATED IN THE LITERATURE AND IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY IS VERY CONSISTENT DOING MAY BE FIVE MINUTES OF OPEN MONERING MEDITATION AND FIVE MINUTES IMMEDIATELY AFTER OF FOCUS ATTENTION MEDITATION DAILY YOU CAN EXPEC THT YOUWILL GET VERY VERY GOOD AT THESE PROCESSIES OH VERY VERY QUICKLY NOW I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO A LANGTHY DESCRIPTION OF THE DIFFERENT A LINES OF EVIDENCE THAT TAT THE CORRESPONDING AREAS OF THE BRAIN ARE ACTIVE IN EACH OF THESE DIFFERENT KINDS OF MEDITATION BUT WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT THERE BEEN SOME BEAUTIFUL WHAT ARE CALLED LOSS OF FUNCTION STUDIES WHERE PARTICULAR BRAIN AREAS ARE EITHER DEPLETED OF DOPAMINE OR WHERE DOPAMINE IN SOME CASES I GESS WHAT WE CALL GAIN OF FUNCTION STUDIES ALTHOUGH NOT THE KIND OFGAIN OF FUNCTION STUDIES ASSOCIAT WITH VIROLOGYN DIFFERENT GAIN OF FUNCTION STUDIES WHERE YOU ENHANCE THE LEVEL OF DOPAMINE IN THE BRAIN WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT BOTH DIVERGENT AND CONVERGEN THINKING ARE ENHANCED WHEN LEVELS OF DOPAMINE ARE ELEVATED NOW WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY TALKING ABOUT FARMACOLOGY HERE IT TURNS OUT THAT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO ELEVATE DOPAMINE THAT MAKE US BETTER AT DIVERGENT AND CONVERGEN THINKING IN PARTICULAR BY USING MOOD AND NOW I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT HOW WHAT MOOD YOU ARE IN WHEN YOU HAPPEN TO START A CREATIVE PROCESS OR TRY IN DO A SORT OF TRAINING SUCH AS OPEN MONERING MEDITATION OR FOCUSS MEDITATION HOW YOURE MOOD RELATES TO YOUR LEVEL OF DOPAMINE AT BASE LINE WHET WE CALL YOUR SOTONIC AS IT'S CALLED MEANING CONSISTENT OR ON GOING LEVEL OF DOPAMINE HOW THAT DICTATES WHETHER R NOT YOU ARE GOING TO BE BETTER AT ONE PARTICULAR ASPECT OF THE CREATIVE PROCESS OR ANOTHER AND HOW YOU CAN ENHANCE YOUR CREATIVITY IN THE VERY SHORT TERM VERY QUICKLY USING TOOLS THAT ARE KNOWN TO TRIGGER ADDITIONAL RELEASE OF DOPAMINE WHICH IN SOME CASES IS GOOD AND IN SOME ASES IS BAD I SHOULD MENTION AND IN OTHER WORDS DETERMINE HOW YOU FEEL IN ONE MOMENT SHOULD DICTATE WHAT SORT OF TOOL YOU SHOULD USE IN ORDER TO BECOME MORE CREATIVE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MOOD AND CREATIVITY IS A FASCINATING ONE THAT IS BRIDGED BY ONE MAIN FEATURE WHICH IS THE AMOUNT OF DOPAMING PRESENT IN THIS NIGROSTRAD OL PATHWAY AND THEREIS A REALLY WONDERFUL CORELECT OR MEASURE OF THE AMOUNT OF DOAMING THAT'S ACTIVE IN THAT PATHWAY THAT CAN BE ADDRESSED NON INVASIVELY IN THE LABORATORY AS I MENTION THE NIGROSRETOL PATHWAYS INVOLVE IN MOVEMENT AND IN I BLINKING WHICH OF COURSE IS A MOVEMENT IT'S NOT A MOVEMENT OF THE SORT THAT WE TYPICALLY THINK OF WHEN WE THINK OF MOVEMENTS BUT NONE THE LESS IT RELIES ON DOPAMING LEVELS IN THIS PATHWAY AND IN FACT WE CAN STATE VERY CONFIDENTLY THAT WHEN DOPAMINE LEVELS ARE ELEVATED THE BLINKING REFLEX IS MORE ACTIVE PEOPLE JUST BLINK MORE WHEN DOPAMINE LEVELS ARE LOWER OR LESS ACTIVE IN THIS PATHWAY PEOPLE TEND TO BLINK LESS SO BLINK FREQUENCY IS A COMMON MEASURE IN STUDIES OF DOPAMING WITHIN THIS PATHWAY THAT RELATE TO CREATIVITY THE WORK THIN EM ABOUT TO DESCRIBE IS LARGELY THE WORK OF TWO AUTHORS WHO HAVE DONE WONDERFUL WORK AND ACROSS SEVERAL PAPERS UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME THEIR NAMES ARE DIFFICULT TO PRONOUNCE O I APOLOGIZE TO THEM IN THEIR RELATIVES FOR AM WHAT IS SURE TO BE IN CORRECT PRONUNCIATION BUT THAT LAST NAMES OF THESE AUTHORS ARE CHEIR MAHENI AND HUMEL THREIN THE NETHERLANDS SO CHAIRMAHENIAN HUMEL DONE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PAPERS OR STUDIES RATHER OF THE RELATIONSHIPD BETWEEN BLINKING MOOD AND CREATIVITY IN PARTICULAR DIVERGENT THINKING WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT IF PEOPLE ARE BLINKING FAIRLY OFTEN AND THEY MEASURE THEIR MOOD THROUGH SUBJECTIVE TESTS AND IF THEY WERE TO DO BRAIN IMAGING WHICH OTHER STUDIES HAVE DONE THEY FIND IS THAT THOSE PEOPLE CAN ENGAGE IN DIVERGENT THINKING VERY EASILY IN OTHER WORDS BEING IN A GOOD MOOD FACILITATES DIVERGENT THINKING OW SOME OF YOU MIGHT IMMEDIATELY SAY WELL DA IF YOU'RE IN A GOOD MOOD YOU CAN CON OBE MORE PLAYFUL ABOUT THE EXPLORATION ABOUT WHAT COULD HAPPEN WITH THESE NOTES OF MUSIC OR THESE FOODS ET CETERA BUT IT'S NOT SO OBVIOUS BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT IF YOUR DOPAMINE LEVELS ARE VERY VERY HIGH AND THIS CAN BE MEASURED NONE AVASIVELY THROUGH THE FREQUENCY OF BLANK SORT CAN BE MEASURED MORE INVASIVELY THROUGH BRAIN IMAGING EVEN THROUGH BLOOD DRAWS OR OTHER METHODS TO MESURED OPEMING IF DOPAMIN LEVELS ARE VERY VERY HIGH WHEL YOU OBSERVE IS THAT DIVERGENT THINKING IS ACTUALLY VERY VERY POOR NOW A NATURALLY OCCURRING TRULY PATHOLOGICAL EXAMPLE THIS WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE MANIC BY POLAR DISORDER WHERE SOMEBODY IS IN THE MANIC PHASE OR SOMEBODY WHO HAS TAKEN METHEMPHEDAMINE OR COCANE WHAT TENDS TO HAPPEN IS THAT THEY HAVE LOTS AND LOTS OF IDEAS ALL OF THOSE IDEAS SEEM REALLY EXCITING TO THEM BUT IF YOU WERE TO TALK TO THEM FOR ANY GIVEN MOMENT THEY WOULD BE VERY FIXATED ON ONE PARTICULAR TUNNEL OF IDEAS AND BY BEING FIXATED ON ONE PARTICULAR TUNNEL OF IDEAS LIKE THE IDEA THAT THERE CAN A RUN FOR PRESIDENT TO MORROW THIS IS A UNFORTUNATELY TYPICAL OF O PEOPLE WHO HAVE BY POLLAR WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT EVERYBODY RUNS FOR PRESIDENT IS BY POLLAR RATHER PEOPLE WHO ARE BY POLAR OFTEN HAVE THESE DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR THAT THEIRE SOMEHOW CAN BE PRESENT SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY DECIDED TO AND THAT THEY WERE SELECTED TO DO THIS ET CETERA ET CETERA IDEAS ABOUT THEMSELVES ANOTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE VERY CONSTRAINE IN THER WORDS NOT VERY DIVERGENT SO DIVERGEN THINKING IS FAVORED BY HAVING ELEVATED LEVELS OF DOPAMENE BUT NOT TOO HIGH THAT OF COURSE CREATES A CONNUNDRUM HOW DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH DOPAMING YOU NEED AND HOW TO ACHIEVE THOSE ELEVATE LEVELS OF DOPAMINE WHELE LEAVING ASIDE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM A MANIC EPISODE WHUT CHERMAHENIAN HOMELL HAVE DISCOVERED IS THAT IF PEOPLE ARE IN SORT OF A LOW MOOD THEY'RE NOT FEELING GRATE MAY BE THEIR DEPRESSED BUT THERE DOES NOT FEELING THAT GRATE THEY FEEL YOU KNO ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN AROUND A TWO WERE A THREE MAY BE AFOR THE PROBABILITY THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO ENGAGE EFFECTIVELY IN DIVERGENT THINKING IS QUITE LOW HOWEVER THE GOOD NEWS IS THEY ARE TYPICALLY VERY SUSCEPTIBLE TO ELEVATIONS IN MOOD THROUGH OBSERVING OR HEARING POSITIVE STORIES LISTENING TO MUSIC THAT THEY LIKE ANY KIND OF SO CALLED INSPIRATIONAL STIMULE NOW THIS IS GOOD NEWS WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT IF YOUR SOMEBODY IS NOT FEELING VERY MOTIVATED TO ENGAGE IN DIVERGENT THINK YOU'RE OT FEELING VERY CREATIVE FEELING A LOW THE THING TO DO IN THAT CASE IS ACTUALLY TO TAKE EXTERNAL STIMULE THINGS THAT YOU KNOW THAT YOU LIKE AND START INTERACTING WITH THOSE STIMULE TO GET YOUR MOOD ELEVATED AND THEN TO ENGAGE IN DIVERGENT THINKING HOWEVER WHAT CHERMHENI AND HOMELL HAVE ALSO SHOWN IS THAT IF PEOPLE ARE ALREADY IN A VERY GOOD MOOD ELEVATING DOPAMEN FURTHER IS NOT CONDUCIVE AND IN FACT IS DETRIMENTAL TO DIVERGENT THINKING AND IN THAT CASE THEY WOULD BE BETTER OFF FOR EXAMPLE NOT ENGAGING IN ANY ACTIVITIES OR YOU KNOW TAKING ANY THING IN THE WAY OF PHARMOCOLOGY THAT WOULD FURTHER INCREASE THEIR DOPAMENE AND PROBABLY LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF EXTERNAL STIMULE THAT ARE COMING IN THROUGH MUSIC AND VISUAL STIMULY AND REALLY FOCUSSING ON DIVERGEN THINKING IN THE CREATIVE PROCESS IMMEDIATELY NOW THIS IS IMPORTANT IN AN EARLIER EPISODE BOTH ON BY POLAR AND ON OTHER FORMS OF DEPRESSION I TALKED ABOUT HOW RATES OF BY POLAR MANIC EPISODES AND DOPAMEN LEVELS AND CREATIVITY TEND TO BE CORRELATED NOW UNFORTUNATELY RATES OF SUICIDE ARE TWENTY TO THIRTY TIMES HIGHER AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE BY POLAR DISORDER AS WELL AND SO THERE IS A WHOLE DARK SIDE TO BUT THE BY POLAR DISORDER THAT MAKES IT A VERY VERY DANGEROUS AND IMPORTANT DISORDER TO TREAT BUT FOR SAKE OF THE DISCUSSION OF CREATIVITY WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT WE ALL MEAN TO DEVELOP SOME SORT OF INTUITIVE SENSE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT OUR MOOD IS SUPPOSE WE COULD BIN THIS INTO THREE CATEGORIES IS KIND OF UM YES YOU KNOW HAPPY EXCITED POSITIVE MOOD AND OF COURSE THEIR GON BE LEVELS TO THAT LO ANLIKMON OR CIN O MECH CAN OF BEN THE MIDDLE SO IF YOU'RE IN A LOW MOOD OR CAN AMA MOOD BY ALL MEANS ENGAGE IN SOMETHING PROBABLY FOR ABOUT YOU FIVE TO THIRTY MINUTES THAT ELEVATES YOUR MOOD BEFORE TRYING TO ENGAGE IN DIVERGENT THINKING HOWEVER IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE IN A PRETTY POSITIVE MOOD EVEN IF YOU'RENOT TEN OUT OF TEN ON MOOD THEN BRINGING IN N ADDITIONAL STIMULY TO INCREASE YOUR LEVELS OF DOPAMINE WILL NOT HELP YOU AND IN FACT CAN HURT THE DIVERGEN THINKING PROCESS SO IN THAT CASE I WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT WAS DISCUSSED ON A PREVIOUS EPISODE WHICH IS THE PARTICULAR EFFECTS OF KAFFINE I'LL GET INTO KAFFINE A LITTLE BIT LATER BUT JUST VERY BRIEFLY KAFFINE INCREASES LEVELS OF DOPAMINE RECEPTORS SO IT'S NOT THE KAFFINE IS BAD IN FACT KAFFING CAN BE NEAR OW PROTECTIVE IT CAN INHANCE FOCUS AND SO FORTH BUT DIVERGENT THINKING IS SORT OF ANTI FOCUS IT REQUIRES JUST ENOUGH FOCUS TO BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH NEW IDEAS BUT YOU ACHE DON'T WANT TO BE OVERLY FOCUS FOCUS IS MORE CONDUCIVE TO CONVERGEN THINKING IN FACT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE LITERATURE SHOWS IS THAT KAFFINE BECAUSE ITS EFFECTS ON APINEFERON AND RELATED SYSTEMS IN THE BRAIN LIKE A DENISINE BUT MAINLY BECAUSE OF ITS EFFECTS ON PERSISTENCE AND FOCUS IS VERY CONDUCIVE TO CONVERGENT THINKING SO IF YOUARE SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO EXPLORE CREATIVITY AND WANT TO GET BETTER CREATIVITY YOU NOW KNOW THAT YOU NEED TO ENGAGE IN DIVERGENT THINKING AND THEN AFTERWARDS CONVERGENT THINKING I WOULD RECOMMEND NOT USING STIMULANTS SUCH AS KAFFINE PRIOR TO DIVERGENT THINKING BUT RATHER USE STIMULANTS IF YOU DO WANT U STIMULANTS SUCH AS KAFFINE PRIOR TO CONVERGEN THINKING AND IN FACT IN FORMULATING THE ARCHITECTURE OF TO DAY'S EPISODE WHICH TOOK ME MANY HOURS ACROSS MANY DIFFERENT DAYS I CONFESS I ACTUALLY DECIDE TO TRY THIS IN TRYING TO IMAGINE THE DIFFERENT CONFIGURATIONS AND WAYS THAT THIS INFORMATION CAN BE ORGANIZED I DELIBERATELY ABSTAIN FROM KAFFIN DURING THOSE BOUTS OF WORK AND WHEN STRUCTURING EVERYTHING ACCORDING TO THE DECISIONS I HAD ALREADY MADE I PURPOSELY IN JUSTA KAFFINE PRIOR TO THAT NOW OF COURSE CONSTRUCTING A PODCAST EPISODE IS NOT A REALLY THE ULTIMATE EXAMPLE OF A CREATIVE ACT BECAUSE OF COURSE IT'S TAKING EXISTING INFORMATION IT'S ARRANGING IT A NOVEL WAYS BUT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY ALLOW KEY CONCEPTS TO POP OUT IN THE WAY THAT FOR INSTANCE A BANKSE OR A ROTHGO OR AN ESHER A WOULD POP OUT OKE I I'M CERTAINLY NOT NAIVE IN THINKING THAT IT DOES BUT THE PRINCIPLE OF IS WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE YOU NEED DIVERGENT THINKING U NEED CONVERGENT THINKING YOU NEED SOME LEVEL OF ELEVATED DOPAMINE IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN DIVERGEN THINKING BUT NOT SO HIGH THAT IT STARTS TO IN HIM IT THAT PROCESS NOW IF YOU WERE TO COME INTO THE LABORATORY THIS COULD BE MEASURED BY YOUR FREQUENCY OF BLINKING FOR BETTER FOR WORSE WE CAN'T ACTUALLY COUNT THE NUMBER OF TIMES THAT WE BLINK UNLESS WE'RE ACTIVELY PING ATTENTION TO I SO I DON'T RECOMMEND HE YOU PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR BLINKING IS THAT WILL TAKE YOU OFF COURSE FROM ALL THE OTHER IMPORTANTHINGS OF YOUR LIFE A AND HOW MANY TIMES YOU'RE BLINKING IS RARELY AN IMPORTANT THING FOR YOU TO PAY ATTENTIONTO YOU CAN HOWEVER LEARN TO CALIBRATE YOUR MOOD THAT IS TO ACCESS YOUR MOOD WHETHER NOT YOU'RE IN LOW MEDIUM OR HIG MOOD NO PROBLEM USING THOE THAT BROAD BINNING RIGHT YOU COULD SCALE IT ON ONE TO TEN AND THEN DECIDE WHETHER NOT YOU'RE GOING TO USE SOME DOPAMINE ELEVATING STIMULUS FROM THE OUTSIDE AGAIN COULD BE MUSIC COULD BE EXERCISE IS AN EXCELLENT WAY TO ELEVATE DOPAMIN I'LL TALK ABOUT ANOTHER WELL ESTABLISHED ONE FROM THE FROM THE RESEARCH LITATURE THAT IS NOWN TO ELEVATE DOAMINE BY SIXTY FIVE PER CENT IN THE PARTICULAR PATHWAY THAT'S RELEVANT FOR DIVERGEN THINKING AND TO DO THAT WITHOUT ANY PHARMACOLOGY I'LL SHARE THAT WITH YOU IN A MOMENT BUT YOU NEED TO DECIDE FOR YOU INE GIVEN MOMENT OR IN A GIVEN WORK ATTEMPT AT CREATIVITY WHAT YOU NEED AND APPLY ACCORDINGLY BECAUSE AS CHERAMENI AND HUMEL HAVE SHOWN WHETHER NOT YOU ARE IN A LOW MOOD MEDIUM MOOD OR HIGH MOOD REALLY CAN DETERMINE WHETHER NOT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO ACCESS DIVERGEN THINKING OR NOT NOW IF YOU'R SOMEBODY WHO ALREADY HAS AN IDEA IN MIND YOU'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT A CREATIVE IDEA AND YOU WANT TO HON IT YOU WANT A SHAPE IT YOU WANT A PRESSURE TEST IT WILL TALK A LA BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS IN A THREESTEP PROCESS AN JUST A LITTLE BIT I WOULD STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT THAT PROCESS IS A VERY LINEAR PROCESS IN WHICH THERE ARE RIGHT AND WRONG ANSWERS AND THERE THE USE OF KAFFINE AT APPROPRIATE DOSAGES AND DOSAGES FOR KAFFINE THAT ARE SAFE AND IN FACT PERFORMANCE ENHANCING RECOVERED IN THE EPISODE ON KAFFIN TURNS OUT IT'S ONE TO THREE MELIGRAMS FOR KILEGRAM OF BODYWIT BY THE WAY AND IF YOU WANT TO LEVERAGE KAFFINE OR MABE VEN OTHER FORMS OF HEALTHY LEGAL STIMULANTS THOSE ARE COVERED IN THE KAFFINE EPISODE I'LL TALK ABOUT A FEW MORE ELOBIT LATER SO TO SUMRISE THIS SEGMENT AND ALSO JUST TO MAKE A MORE GENERAL POINT I THINK IT'S VERY USEFUL FOR PEOPLE TO START TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT THERE TONIC LEVEL THAT IS THEIR BASELONE LEVEL OF DOPAMINE OUGHT TO BE IN THIS NIGROSTRIT'LL CIRCUIT ANY ANOTHER CIRCUITS AND TO DO THAT BY LEARNING TO ASSESS ONE'S MOOD AND PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT KIND OF MOOD THEY HAPPEN TO BE IN AND THEN TO LEVERAGE TOOLS BEHAVIAL TOOLS MAY BE PHARMICALOGIC TOOLS PROVIDED THEIR SAFE IN THEIR LEGAL IN ORDER TO EITHER INCREASED DOPAMINE OR TO ELECT NOT TO INCREASE DOPAMINE IN ORDER TO ACCESS THE CREATIVE PROCESS NOW IVE MENTION FARMACOLOGY A FEW TIMES I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THAT JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE IN THE CONTEXT OF DOPAMINE FIRST OF ALL THERE IS NO SUPPLEMENT OR DRUG THAT YOU OR ANY ONE ELSE CAN TAKE THAT WILL SELECTIVELY ELEVATE DOPAMINE IN ONLY ONE OF THE FORE CIRCUITS THAT I DESCRIBED BEFOR CAND THIS IS JUST THE STATE OF THE TECHNOLOGY NOWADAYS IF YOU TAKE A PILL OR EVEN IF YOU WERE TO INJECT SOME SUBSTANCE AGAIN IO THES BE LEGAL OM IT AND SAFE ET CETERA WHATEVER MOTIVE DELIVERY THERE IS NO TECHNOLOGY THAT EXISTS AT THIS TIME THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU TO SELECTIVELY AMPLIFIED DOPAMINE FOR INSTANCE JUST IN THE NIGROSTRIAT OL PATHWAY OR JUST IN THE MESICUORTICAL PATHWAY AGAIN THE NIGROSTRATAL PATHWAY ASSOCIATE WITH DIVERGEN THINKING THE MUSICORTICAL PATHWAY ASSOCIATED WITH COGNIVE PERSISTENCS IN CONVERGEN THINKING IF YOU WERE TO AMPLIFY DOPAMI LEVELS FOR INSTANCE BY TAKING THE AMENOACID PRECURSUR TO DOPAMINE EL TYRISINE SOMETHING THAT I OCCASIONALLY DO TO ENHANCE DOPAMINE LEVELS FOR SAKE OF WORK OR ENERGY FIVE HUNDRED MILIGRAMS OR A THOUSAND MLIGRAMS EVEN OF EL TYRISINE SOMETIMES I'LL COMBINE THAT WITH OTHER THINGS LIKE ALFAG P C IT'S GOING TO ENHANCE DOPAMINE TRANSMISSION IN THE NIGROSTRAATAL PATHWA AY THEM MUS A CORTICAL PATHWAY BUT ALSO IN THE MUSOLYMBIC PATHWAY AND ALSO FOR THAT MATTER IN THE TUBERO INFER GIBULAR PATHWAY ASSOCIATE WITH THE PATUITARY THERE'S NO WAY TO DIRECT DOPOMINE ACTIVATION TO JUST ONE OF THOSE PATHWAYS THAT'S JUST A REFLECTION OF THE EXISTING HICNOLOGY NOW THIS IS ALSO TRUE IF YOU RELY ON A ELICIT DRUGS TO INCREASE DOPOMENES OF ITS COCANE OR METHEMPHEDAMINE THOSE WILL GREATLY INCREASE DOPOMINE BUT NONSELECTIVELY ACROSS ALL THOSE DIFFERENT PATHWAYS AND LIKEWISE WITH ANY DRUGS THAT INHIBIT OR BLOCK OR ANTAGONIZES ITS CALLED DOPAMINE THIS IS WHY PEOPLE WHO FOR INSTANCE HAVE SCHYSOPHRENIA AND TAKE DRUGS TO SUPPRESS AUDITORY HALLUCINATIONS SOME OF THOSE DRUGS WORK BECAUSE THEY BLOCK THE SOCAL DETU RECEPTOR OF THE DOPOMINE PATHWAY DETU RECEPTORS ARE PRESENT IN ALL FOUR OF THE DOPOMENURGIC PATHWAYS IN THE BRAIN AND OFTENTIMES THOSE DRUGS WILL IN FACT SUPPRESS PSYCHODIC SYMPTOMS AUDITORY HALLUCINATIONS ET CETERA BECAUSE THEY REDUCE DOPAMINE BUT THOSE PEOPLE OFTENTIMES WILL HAVE PROBLEMS WITH MOVEMENT THEY WILL EXPRESS WHATS COLLED IN THE CLINICAL LITERATURE TARDIVE DISCINESIA KIND OF WRITHING OF THE FACE THE BODY FROM SUPPRESSION OF DOPOMINE WITHIN THE NIGROSTRITAL PATHWAY WHICH IS ASSOCIATE WITH MOVEMENT THEY WILL SOMETIMES HAVE DEPHISITS IN I BLINKING PEOPLE WITH PARKINSINS WHO ACTUALLY HAVE SELECTIVE DEPHISITS OF DOPAMIN WITHIN THE SUBSTANTIAL NIGRA NIGROSTRIDO REMEMBER SUBSTANTIAL NIGRA SHOW DEPHISITS IN WHAT IN MOVEMENT IN THES MOVENESS OF MOVEMENT OFTENTIMES THEY WON'T BLINK AT ALL THEOUGL HAVE KIND OF A BLANK STARE AND THEY HAVE OTHER ISSUES AS WELL SO IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO IS INTERESTED IN INCREASING DOPOMINE THROUGH THE USE OF LEGAL SAFE PHARMICOLOGY I WOULD HOPE IT WOULD BE THE CASE THERE ALWAYS TO DO THAT REASONABLY SAFELY FOR MOST PEOPLE AGAIN PEOPLE WITH BY POLAR DISORDER OR ISSUES WITH THE DOPOMENURGIC PATHWAY SHOULD NOT DO THIS I KNOW NOWADAYS THERE'S A LOT OF USE OF DRUGS THAT INCREASE DOPOMINE SUCH AS RIDLIN ATERALL MODAPHANEL ARMODAPHNEL OFTEN PRESCRIBED FOR THINGS LIKE ATTENTION DEPHISIT HYPORACTIVITY DISORDER WE DIDN ENTIRE EPISODE ON ADITY AND PHARMICALOGIC PRESCRIPTION SUPPLEMENT AND BEHAVORAL NUTRITIONAL TOOLS RADIY CAN FIND THAT EPISODE A HUBRMEN LAVHDOK CALM I KNOW A NUMBER OF PEOPLE TAKE THOSE COMPOUNDS IN ORDER TO INCREASE DOPOMINE AND FOCUS FORSAKE OF STUDYING OR OTHER ACTIVITIES STAYING UP LONG HOURS ET CETERA AND THE FACT THAT THEY INCREASE FOCUS THEY ARE EFFECTIVE ALTHOUGH THEY DO HAVE THEIR SIDE EFFECTS SOMETIMES SEVERE SOMETIMES HABIT FORMING SOMETIMES EVEN ADDICTING AS WELL BUT THE FACT THAT THEY INCREASE FOCUS SHOULD AUTOMATICALLY TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT THOSE DRUGS INPARTICULAR INCREASE DOPOMINE IN THE SO CALLED MESOCORTICAL AND MESOLYMBIC PATHWAYS WHY CAN I SAY THAT HOW CAN I SAY THAT WITH ANY DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE WELL THEYRE THESE FOUR PATHWAYS ONES INVOLVED IN MOVEMENT BUT THESE OTHER ONES ARE INVOLVED IN MOTIVATION AND DESIRE AND REWARD AND I TOLD YOU THAT THESE THINGS CAN BE HABIT FORMING AN ADDICTING IN SOME CASES AND THEY ARE CAN GREATLY IN REASE FOCUS AND FOCUS IS SUPPORTED BY ENHANCE LEVELS OF DOPAOMINE WITHIN THIS MEASA LYMBIC AND MESOCORTICAL PATHWAY SO YES THOSE DRUGS INCREASED DOPAMINE ACROSS THE BOARD BUT THERE DOES SEEM TO BE SOME WAITING OF DOPAMINE TOWARD THE SYSTEMS IVOLVED IN MOTIVATION AND REWARD IN SOMETIMES EVEN LEADING TO HABIT FORMATION AND ADDICTION THAT'S WHY THOSE DRUGS SHOULD ONLY BE TAKIN WITH THE CLOSE SUPERVISION OF A VERY SKILLED PSYCHIATRIST OR SOMEBODY ELSE WHOSE BOARD CERTIFIED WHO CAN REALLY GOVERN THAT THERE ARE HOWEVER WAYS TO INCREASED DOPAOMINE MORE EVENLY ACROSS THE BOARD USING NON PRESCRIPTION APPROACHES AND ONE I ALREADY MENTION WHICH IS ALTYIRASINE TAKEN TYPICALLY IN DOSAGES OF FIVE HUNDRED TO A THOUSAND MILIGRAMS ELTYRACINE IS NOT AS POTENT IN INCREASING DOPAMINE AS ARE THE PRESCRIPTIONS DRUGS THAT I REFERRED TO BEFORE TENDS TO BE MILDER FOR SOME PEOPLE IT CAN HAVE A VERY EMPLIFIED EFFECT THEY FEEL IT RIGHT AWAY ITS VERY INTENSS IN ELEVATING FOCUS AND MOTIVATION AND THE DESIRE TO MOVE FOR OTHER PEOPLE ITS LESS POTENT IT REALLY DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF THINGS I SHOULD MENTION THAT REGULAR CONSUMPTION OF KAFFINE OF ONE TO THREE MILIGRAMS PER KILEGRAM BODYWAT PER DAY ALSO WILL INCREASE DOPAMIN RECEPTOR EFFICACY AND DENSITY WHICH WILL MAKE ANY EXISTING DOPAMINE MORE EFFECTIVE WHETHER NOT THAT DOPAMINE IS TRIGGERED BY THINGS THEY ALTRASINE OR IF YOU'RE NOT TAKING ANYTHING TO ELEVATE DOPAMINE THE DOPAMINE THAT YOU DO MAKE WILL BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN ELEVATING YOUR MOVD MOTIVATION AND DESIRE TO MOVE AND BY EXTENSION DIVERGENT THINKING IF YOU ARE CONSUMING KAFFINE BUT AGAIN KAFFINE SHOULD BE TAKEN PRIOR TO CONVERGENT THINKING TYPE TASK PROBABLY MORE THAN IT SHOULD BE TAKEN PRIOR TO DIVERGEN THINKING TASKS AND OF COURSE THERE OTHER LEGAL SUPPLEMENTS THAT CAN ELEVATE DOPAMINE AS WELL IN PARTICULAR FENAL ETHELAMINE IS VERY EFFECTIVE IN DOING THAT SIX HUNDRED MILIGRAMS IT THAT HAS A BRIEF EFFECT LASTING ONLY ABOUT THIRTY TO FORTY FIVE MINUTES BUT IT IS ONE THAT MANY PEOPLE FIND BENEFICIAL FOR SAKE OF STUDYING OR FOR CREATIVE THINKING AND SO ON AND SO FORTH NOW THAT'S FORMACOLOGY AND IN FACT THERE'S AN EXTENSIVE LANDSCAPE OF PRESCRIPTION AND SUPPLEMBASE PHARMOCOLOGY AND INDEED NUTRITION FOR INSTANCE THE CONSUMPTION OF FOODS THAT ARE HIGH AND ALTYRASINE SUCH AS AGED PARMAGON CHEESE FOR INSTANCE OF ALL THINGS VERY VERY HIGH AND ALTYRASINE THE PRECURSUR TO DOPAMINE CERTAIN FOODS YOU CAN LOOK UP ON LINE WHICH FOODS CONTAIN HIGH LEVELS OF ALTYRASINE IN WHICH ONES ARE COMPATIBLE WITH YOU ARE NUTRITION BUT LEAVING FARMACOLOGY ASIDE THERE'S A VERY EXCITING NON PHARMICALOGIC TOOL A PURELY BEHAVIORAL TOOL THAT THE RESEARCH LITERATURE HAS TOLD US CAN SELECTIVELY INCREASE DOPAMINE WITHIN THE NIGRO STRIATAL PATHWAY THE PATHWAY THAT'S INVOLVED IN DIVERGENT THINKING AND CAN DUSO VERY DRAMATICALLY AS MUCH AS SIXTY FIVE PER CENT ABOVE BASE LINE AND SO THIS IS A BEHAVIORAL TOOL THAT IS USEFUL FOR A NUMBER OF THINGS BUT THAT I FIND PARTICULARLY INTERESTING IN LEVERAGING TOWARDS THE EXPLORATION AND ENHANCEMENT OF CREATIVITY BECAUSE FIRST VAULITS PURELY BEHAVIORAL SO ITS ZERO COST AND IT INVOLVES NOMEN NIPULATION OF BRAIN NERMOGULATORS OR CHEMISTRY THROUGH PHARMOCHOLOGY SO IT SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN EXPLORE VERY SAFELY AND CERTAINLY NOT HAVING TO PURCHASE ANYTHING AND WHAT'S REALLY REMARKABLE IS THE SELECTIVITY OR I THIN IT'S FAIR TO SAY THE IMMENSE SELECTIVITY THAT THIS PARTICULAR BEHAVIORL INTERVENTION SEEMS TO EXERT ON DOPEMING WITHIN THIS PATHWAY ASSOCIATED WITH DIVERGEN THINKING SO THE STUDY THAT I'M ABOUT TO DESCRIBE IS E STUDY THE DATES BACK TWENTY YEARS NOW THAT SHOULD NOT CONCERN YOU IN FACT THE EARLY ARRIVAL OF THIS STUDY OR WHAT NOW SEEMS TO BE EARLY ARRIVAL WASN'T THAT LONG AGO IS REALLY EXTITING BECAUS THE FIRST LINE OF THIS STUDY REALLY ILLUSTRATES HOW IMPORTANT OR HOW MUCH OF A LANDMARK STUDY THIS REALLY IS AND SAL JUST READ YOU THE FIRST LINE OF THE STUDY THEN I'LL ELL YOU THE TITLE THEN I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THEY DISCOVERED IN FAIRLY TOP CONTOUR AND WE WILL PROVIDELING TO THE STUDY IF YOU WANT TO PERUSE IT IN MORE DETAIL THE FIRST LINE OF THE STUDY IS THIS IS THE FIRST INVIVO JUST MEANING IN THE ORGANISM AND THIS CAS THIS WAS A STUDY ON HUMANS THIS IS THE FIRST INVIVO DEMONSTRATION OF AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN AN INDOGENOUS NOR TRANSMITTER RELEASE INDOGENS MEANS WITHIN US AND CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE SO WHAT THE SENTENCE ESSENTIALY SAYS IS THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY EXPLORING HOW A CHEMICAL THAT'S NATURALLY RELEASED IN OUR BODY RELATES TO A PARTICULAR QUALITY OF CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE THIS STUDY WAS PERFORMED IN SCANANAVIA IN ONE OF THE HOSPITALS IN DENMARK AGAIN WILL PROVIDE A LENGTH THE FIRST AUTHOR IS KARE I THINK I'M PRONOUNCING IT CORRECTLY ALTHOUGH PROBABLY NOT K J A E AR AT ALL AND THE TITLE OF THE STUDY IS INCREASED DOPAMING TONE DURING MEDITATION INDUCE CHANGE OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND I WANT TO JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT THE MEDITATION USED IN THE STUDY ISN'T REALLY A MEDITATION AT ALL I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY SELECTED THAT FOR THE TITLE THE BEHAVIOROPROTOCAL USED IN THE STUDY WAS MORE AKIN TO WHAT IS NORMALLY ALLED YOGAN NEDRA OR ANESTI ARE NON  SLEEP DEEP REST NOW YOGANEDRA AND ANESTY ARE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST YOGANEDRA FOR INSEANCEIS IT PRACTICE THAT'S BEEN AROUND FOR HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF YEARS IN WHICH PEOPLE DELIBERATELY LIES STILL SO THEYRE FORCING THEMSELVES TO BE MOSTLY MOTIONLESS SMALL MOVEMENTS ARE FINE AND THEIR DIRECTING THEIR ATTENTION TO THE SURFACE OF THEIR BODY EITHER DOING LONG ACAIL BREATHING SOMETIMES SOME INTENTIONS SOMETIMES SOME VISUALIZATION BUT IT'S REALLY SELF DIRECTED RELAXATION AND THE KEY COMPONENT IS THAT PEOPLE STAY AWAKE AND ENGAGE IN VERY LITTLE MOVEMENT AND THE KEYWARD THERE IS MOVEMENT NOW NON SLEEP DEEP REST IT IS A ACRONYM A TERM THAT I COINED IT'S NOT A TERM THAT I COINED IN ORDER TO TRYING TO WIPE AWAY OR DISCARRD WITH YOGANEDRAMA PERSON WHO HAS GREAT RESPECT FOR YOGANEDRA AND ITS TRADITIONS IT'S A TERM THAT A I COINED IN ORDER TO INCOMPASS A NUMBER OF PRACTICES THAT DON'T INCLUDE ANY MYSTICAL TYPE LANGUAGE OR SCIENTIFIC LANGUAGE FOR THAT MATTER AND THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE INTENTIONS INVOLVES DEEP RELAXATION YET REMAINING WIDE AWAKE ANCONSCIOUS SOMETIMES PEOPLE FALL ASLEEP AND THAT SOKE BUT THIS IS REALLY AN A TYPICAL BRAIN STATE OF BEING DEEPLY RELAXED YET IN GENERAL AWAKE ND MOTIONLESS AGAIN MOTIONLESS BEING THE KEY VERY FEW BRAIN STATES INVOLVE US BEING MOTILY IF NOT COMPLETELY MOTIONLESS AND YET AWAKE AND IT TURNS OUT THAT BRAIN STATE WHETHER NOT YOU CALL IT YOGANEDRA YOU CALL IT ANESTIAR WHETHER NOT YOU CALL IT MEDITATION INDUCED SHIFT IN CONSCIOUSNESS AS THEY DID THIS STUDY ALTHOUGH THEY DO REFER TO YEOGANEDRA ALL REFER TO THE SAME THING WHICH IS BEING MOTIONLESS AND YET AWARE AND RELAXED I SHOULD MENTION SO IN THIS STUDY WHAT THEY DID WHAC THEY BROUGHT SUBJECTS INTO THE LABORATORY THEY HAD THEM EITHER UNDERGO THIS SELF DIRECTED DEEP RELAXATION WHILE THEY ARE MOTIONLESS ARE MOSTLY MOTIONLESS OR THEY HAD THEM LISTEND TO AN AUDIOSCRIPT WHILE ALSO JUST LYING THERE WITH EYES CLOSED AND THEN THEY USED A NUMBER OF A CHEMICAL TRICKS ANDI NO ONE TO GET TOO DEEP INTO THOSE NOW CAUSE THEY CAN BELOW  DISTRACTING FOR THOSE OF YOU THEIR INTERESTED YOU CAN LOOK AT IN THE STUDY THIS IS A A BINDING OF A CHEMICAL IN THE BRAIN THAT THEN THEY CAN IMAGE WITH BRAIN IMAGING WHICH IS WHAT THEY DID IN THE STUDY TO A VALUATE HOW MUCH DOPAMINE CHANGED IN THE BRAIN AND WERE SPECIFICALLY IN THE BRAIN DOPOAMINE CHANGED ITS LEVELS BEFORE DURING AND AFTER THIS PARTICULAR BEHAVIORAL PRACTISE IN ONE OR THE OTHER GROUP ND WHAT THEY DISCOVERED IS THAT PEOPLE WHO DID THIS DEEP RELAXATION THAT IS SELF DIRECTED DEEP RELAXATION LYING THEIR EYES CLOSED RELATIVELY MOTIONLESS ALTHOUGH SMALL MOVEMENTS OF THE BODY OR A MOVEMENTS OF THE HEAD ARE ABSOLUTELY FINE WHAT THEY OBSERVED WAS A SIXTY FIVE PER CENT INCREASE IN DOPOMINE RELEASE NOW HERE ITS KEY DOPOMINE RELEASE AND THEY OBSERVED AND INCREASE IN SO CALLED FHATA ACTIVITY THETO ACTIVITY IS A PATTERN OF BRAINWAVOE ACTIVITY THAT'S COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH CREATIVE STATES IN DIVERGENT THINKING IN PARTICULAR SO THAT'S IMPORTANT AND THEY OBSERVE THAT ACROSS SUBJECTS SPECIFICALLY IN THE NIGROSTRATE OR PATHWAY THIS PATHWAY ASSOCIATED WITH DIVERGEN THINKING SO THIS IS VERY EXCITING THIS IS A STUDY THAT REALLY POINTS TO A BEHAVIORAL TOOL THAT CAN BE USED TO SELECTIVELY ELEVATE DOPAMINE IN THE VERY PATHWAY THAT ONE WOULD WANT TO IF THEY WANTED TO ENGAGE DIVERGENT THINKING FORSAKE OF CREATIVE EXPLORATION THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF KEY OBSERVATIONS WITHIN THE STUDY FIRST OF ALL THE REDUCTION INBODILY MOVEMENT WAS ESSENTIAL IN FACT WHEN PEOPLE RATED ORAND WHEN THE AMOUNT OF READINESS FOR ACION IN THEIR SYSTEM THEIR BODY WAS AVALUATED WHAT PEOPLE FOUND WAS THAT IMMEDIATELY AFTER THIS PRACTICE THEY FELT VERY STILL IN OTHER WORDS THEY FELT AS IF REMAINING STILL WAS NATURAL NOW IT'S NOT THE CASE THAT THEY COULDN'T MOVE IN FACT THE ELEVATION AN DOPAMINE THAT OCCURRED DURING THIS PRACTISE THIS YOGANEDRA LIKE NON SLEEP OR ANESTAR LIKE PRACTICE ACTUALLY PREPARED THEM TO BE ABLE TO MOVE EIN A MUCH M OR A DEDICATED AND ROBUST WAY AFTERWARDS BUT DURING THE PRACTISE THEIR READINESS FOR ACTION WHEN WAYWAY DOWN NOT SURPRISING THEY WERE PRETTY MUCH MOTIONLESS BUT INTERESTINGLY AS THE LEVEL OF READINESS FOR MOVEMENT WENT DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN THEIRE DEGREE OF VISUAL IMAGERY THAT IS THEIRE INTERNAL LANDSCAPE AND THEIR ABILITY TO IMAGIN NEW THINGS INCREASED AND IN FACT AREAS OF THE BRAIN THAT ARE ASSOCIATE WITH VISUAL IMAGERY SUCH AS THE VISUAL OR SO CALLED OCCIPITAL QUARTAX IN THE PRIDAL QUARTEX HAS BEEN SHOWN ANOTHER STUDIES TO RAMP UP WHEN PEOPLE ARE MOTIONLESS SO THERE SEEMS TO BE THIS INVERSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MOVEMENT AND VISUAL IMAGERY WHICH MAKE SENSE WHEN WE'RE MOVING WE CAN PAY ATTENTION TO THINGS IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD WE TEND TO BE AWARE OF OUR SENSORY ENVIRONMENT TO VARYING DEGREES BUT WE DON'T TEND TO BE VERY FOCUSED ON VISUAL IMAGERY WITHIN OUR HEAD WHEREAS WHEN WE LIE DOWN OR SIT DOWN AND CLOSE OUR EYES AND WE ARE MOTIONLESS THE DEGREE OF VISUAL IMAGERY REALLY INCREASES HENCE THE INCREASE IN DIVERGEN THINKING BECAUSE WHAT ESSENTIALY IS HAPPENING IS THE LIBRARY OF OPTIONS THE LIBRARY OF POSSIBLE INTERACTIONS WITH WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT I GIVE THE EXAMPLE WHICH IS A TRIVIAL ONE ON PURPOSE OF A PEN BUT THE BANK OF OPTIONS THAT BECOMES AVAILABLE WHEN WE ARE MOTIONLESS AND WHEN WE ARE LIMITING ARE VISUALIZATION OF THE EXTERNAL WORLD INCREASES EXPINENTIALLY SO THIS IS IMPORTANT IN WHAT IT POINTS TO IS THE FACT THAT THIS VERY SIMPLE COMPLETELY NON PORMICAL OGIC BEHAVIORAL PRACTICE OF LYING DOWN MOTIONLESS FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME AND I CONFESS THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THEY USE IN THE STUDY WAS QUITE LONG IT WAS LONGER THAN SIXTY MINUTES BUT ALL THE DATA THAT I 'M AWARE OF IN TERMS OF ENESDIAR AND YOGANEDRA AD THERE'S A GROWING BODY OF LITERATURE ON THE THESE PRACTICES I SHOULD MENTION SHOW THAT EVEN TEN MINUTES OR EVEN BETTER WOULD BE TWENTY OR THIRTY MINUTES OF LYING MOTIONLESS WITH EYES CLOSED AND ALLOWING THE MIND TO DRIFT WHEREVER IT HAPPENS TO GO BUT FOCUSING ON REALACXING BY DOING LONG EXAL BREATHING PERHAPS DOING A BODY SCAN OF FOCUSING YOUR TENSION ON PARTICULAR BODY PARTS BUT NOT KEEPING IT FOCUSED ON ANY ONE PARTICULAR BODY PART FOR THAT LONG THAT GENERAL PRACTICE OF DEEP RELAXATION WHILE AWAKE AND BEING RELATIVELY MOTIONLESS REALLY FAVORS THE BRAIN STATES ASSOCIAT WITH DIVERGIN THINKING AND ACTUALLY REPRESENTS AN ACCESSING OF THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS THAT YOU WOULD USE DURING DIVERGEN THINKING AND PERHAPS MOST EXCITINGLY IT'S ASSOCIATE WITH THIS MASSIVE INCREASE SIXTY FIVE PER CENT INCREASE IN DOPAMING RELEASE WITHIN THE VERY PATHWAY THAT UNDER LIES DIVERGEN THINKING SO MY RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE TRYING TO ENHANCE DIVERGEIN THINKING IN CREATIVE ABILITY THAT YOU WOULD DO THIS PRACTICE AT A MINIMUM ONCE PER WEEK AND I SHOULD SAY IF YOU WERE GOING TO DO AT ONCE PER WEEK I'D RECOMMEND DOING IT FOR ABOUT TWENTY TO THIRTY MINUTES SOME OF YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO IT FOR AS LONG AS SIXTY MINUTES I MYSELF DO SUCH A PRACTICE ON A DAILY BASIS ANYWHERE FROM TEN MINUTES TO TWENTY MINUTES SOMETIMES THIRTY MINUTES THERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF AN ENES DIAR SCRIPT COMPLETELY A ZEROC OST I CONFESS IT DOES HAPVEN TO BE MY VOICE A SO FORGIVE ME A IN ADVANCE THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS OF ANESTI ARGUNG GO TO UTUB PUT N S D R AND MY NAME AGAIN COMPLETELY ZERO COST YOU CAN GET IT SAMPLE OF WHAT A TEN MINUTE A ANESTIAR SCRIPT LOOKS LIKE THAT A THROUGH VIRTUSAN PUT THAT OUT THERE IM SO THINK YOU VIRTHUS AN FOR PUTTING THAT OUT THERE T ZERO COST THERE ARE EXAMPLES OF TWENTY AND THIRTY MINUTE A ANESTIAR SCRIPTS AND YEOGANEDR SCRIPTS SOME THAT I PARTICULARLY LIKE WE WILL ALSO PROVIDE A LINK TO SOME OF THOSE AGAIN THOSE ARE COMPLETELY ZERO COST FOR YOU TO EXPLORE BUT MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOU FOLLOW ANY ONE PARTICULAR YOGANEDRA AND STI AR SCRIPT IS THAT YOU LEARN TO TAKE YOUR BODY AND BRAIN INTO THESE STATES OF LIMITED MOTION ELEVATED DOPAMINE WITHIN THIS PARTICULAR PATHWAY AND FAIRILY DEEP RELAXATION AGAIN IF YOU HAPPEN TO FALL ASLEEP THAT'S YOU KNOW NOT NECESSARILY A BAD THING ALTHOUGH THE IDEAS THAT YOU STAY IN A SHALLOW PLANE OF CONSCIOUSNESS OR SLEEP A HENCE THE TERM NON SLEEP DEEP BREST NOH IN ANY EVENT I THINK THIS IS A VERY USEFUL PRACTICE THAT MANY PEOPLE COULD BENEFIT FROM IN THE FACT THAT AT ZERO COST IN PURELY BEHAVIORAL I THINK ADDS A ADDITIONAL BENEFIT BECAUSE IT CERTAINLY ONE THAT PEOPLE COULD EXPLORE DEPENDING ON WHAT A AMOUNT OF TIME YOU'REWILLING TO COMMIT AND THE RESEARCH STATE ON THIS A NOW EXTEND BEYOND THIS ONE INDIVIDUAL PAPER AND I THINK IS REALLY EXCITING BECAUSE WHAT IT SAYS IS AS THE TITLE AND FIRST LINE OF THE PAPER SUGGESTS IS THT WE CAN INCREASE DOPAMINE USING SPECIFIC TYPES OF MEDITATION INDUCED CONSCIOUSNESS AND THOSE INCREASES IN DOPAOMNE CAN BE USED TO INCREASE OUR ABILITY TO BE MORE CREATIVE BEFORE MOVING FORWARD I WANT TO MAKE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR HOW IT IS THAT YOU WOULD USE AN ST R A K A YEOGANEDRA OR SIMILAR THE NAME DOESN'T REALLY MATTER AFTER ALL THE PRACTICE IS WHAT MATTERS IN ORDER TO ENHANCE DOPAOMINE IN THIS NIGROSTRATO PATHWAY AND ENHANCE DIVERGEN THINKING THE KEY THING TO UNDERSTAND HERE IS THAT THE PERIOD OF MOTIONLESSNESS AND DEEP RELAXATION WILL AWAKE INCREASES DOPAMINE IN THE NIGROSTRITAL PATHWAY IT INCREASES MENTAL IMAGERY THAT IS IT INCREASES ACCESS TO THE BANK OR THE LIBRARY IF YOU WILL OF POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS OR ELEMENTS TO ENGAGE IN THE DIVERGENT THINKING PROCESS BUT DIVERGENT THINKING ITSELF DOES NOT OCCUR DURING AN S T R A K A YOGANEDRA THE ENESTIAR AND YEOGANEDRA DEEP RELAXATION MEDITATION WHATEVER IT IS YOU WANT TO CALL IT SETS A DOPAMINERGIC TONE AND THAT'S ACTUALLY THE APPROPRIATE USE OF THE WORD DOPAMANERGIC TONE IT RAISES THE BASELINE OF DOPAMINE TRANSMISSION IN THAT CIRCUITRY THAT THEN POSITIONS YOU TO ENGAGE IN DIVERGENT THINKING MORE EFFECTIVELY SO THE IDEA WOULD BE TO DO ANYWHERE FROM TEN TO TWENTY MAYBE THIRTY MINUTES MAYBEVEN AS MUCH AS AN HOUR DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH TIME YOU HAD TO DEDICATE OF SUCH A MEDITATION AN STI AR PRACTISE AND THEN NOT ASARILY IMMEDIATELY BUT WITHIN THE FIVE TO FIFTEEN MINUTES FOLLOWING THEN TO GO INTO A PRACTICE OF DIVERGEN THINKING AND START DOING CREATIVE EXPLORATION THAT IS TO START THINKING ABOUT DIFFERENT WAYS TO COMBINE EXISTING ELEMENTS IN WHATEVER DOMAIN IT IS THAT YOU WANT TO ACHIEVE CREATIVITY SO THE POINT IS THAT THE DIVERGEN THINKING ITSELF IS NOT OCCURRING DURING THE ANESTY ARE OR YOGANEDRA PRACTISE THE ENISTEARN YOGANEDR O PRACTICE PREPARES YOU FOR DIVERGEN THINKING THAT YOU DO IN THE HOUR OR HOURS THAT FOLLOWS AND JUST TA CONTRAST THAT WITH PHARMICOLOGY I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY SPECIFIC DOPOMEN RELATED PHARMICOLOGY THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO SELECTIVELY INCREASE DOPOMIN IN THE VERY PATHWAY ASSOCIATE WITH DIVERGEN THINKING IN CREATIVITY NOW THERE ARE FORMS OF PHARMACOLOGY THAT KIN SHIFT BRAIN NARROW TRANSMITTORS AN ERMODULATORS IN WAYS THAT FAVOR CREATIVITY AND THIS IS CERTAINLY ATOPIC THAT WE WILL GO IN TO IN MORE DEPTH THAN A FUTURE EPISODE BUT THERE IS AN EXCITING STUDY THAT WAS PERFORMED JUST TAS LAST YEAR LOOKING AT THE ROLL OF SERATONAN ANOTHER NERMODULATOR IN DIVERGEN AND CONVERGEN THINKING AND IT TURNS OUT THAT SERATONAN UNDERLIES A LOT OF THE BRAIN ACTIVITY THAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR BOTH DIVERGEN IN FOR CONVERGEN THINKING AND THERE'S ONE PARTICULAR FORMOF PHARMACOLOGY WHICH CAN ENHANCE ACTIVATION OF THE SERTENERGIC PATHWAYS ASSOCIATE WITH THE SO CALLED FIVE H T THAT SERATONAN FIVE H T THAT'S THE ABBREVIATION FIVAE T TO A RECEPTOR SERATONAN TO A RECEPTOR IN PARTICULAR BRAINAREAS IN WAYS THAT FAVOR BOTH DIVERGEN AND CONVERGEN THINKING AND THE PHARMOCLOGIC AGENT IN THAT CASE TURNS OUT TO BE VERY LODOSE OR A SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF IT REFERRED TO AS MICRODOSING OF SYLICIBON NOW I DO ONE TO SAY BECAUSE ITWUL BE ENTIRELY INAPPROPRIATE FOR ME TO NOT SAY THIS THAT IN MOST AREAS OF THE WORLD AND PARTICULAR IN THE UNITED STATES SCYLICIBON IS STILL ELLEGAL IT IS NOT LEGAL IN SOME ARS IT HAS BEEN DECRIMINALIZE AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CLINICAL TRIALS OCCURRING NOW AT JOHN'S HOPKINS AT STAMPFORD AT UNIVERSALY CALFORNIA SAMRASIS GO AND ELSEWHERE EXPLORING SYLICIBON FOR THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION FOR TRAMA FOR EATING DISORDERS MOST OF THOSE STUDIES FOCUS ON MACRODOSES OF SYLICIBON NOT MICRODOSING THERE R FAR FEWER STUDIES OF MICRODOSING OF SYLICIBON AND I DO HAVE TO POINT OUT THAT SYLICIBON USE ON AND POSSESSION AND OF COURSE SAL IS STILL ELLEGAL SO I WOULD BE REMISSIVE I DIDN'T STATE THAT HOWEVER I WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO THE STUDY THAT SHOWS THAT MICRODOSING F SYLICIBON FOR A SERIES OF WEEKS ON A DAILY BASIS SO THESE ARE DOSAGES OF SYLISIBON THAT DO NOT INDUCE HILUCINATION AND DO NOT MASSIVELY SHIFT MOOD OR INTERNAL STATES IN ANY WAY THAT HAS PEOPLE FEELING LIKE THE ARE ACTING OR FEELING THAT MUCH DIFFERENT ALTHOUGH SOME PEOPLE DO REPORT A SUBJECTIVE SHIFT DOES SEEM TO INCREASE DIVERGEN THINKING ABILITY BUT I DO WANT TO PUT A BIG ASTRAA HIGHLIGHT AND AN UNDERLINE PEN BENEATH THE STATEMENT I'M ABOUT TO MAKE WHICH IS THAT PHARMOCOLOGY OF THE SERATONAN SYSTEM JUST AS PHARMOCOLOGY OF THE DOPOMINE SYSTEM IS VERY BROAD BAND IT'S A SHOKGUN APPROACH ARE GOING TO HIT ALL THE CIRCUITS OF THE BRAIN THAT INVOLVE CERETONIAN WITH MICRODOSING SYL ESIBON ALTHOUGHIT HAS SOME SELECTIVITY FOR THE FIVE AH T TO A RECEPTOR IT CAN ATTACHED TO OTHER RECEPTORS IS WELL AN ACT THERE IS THE SAME REASON WHY ESCESS ORISE SELECTIVE CERETONA REUP TAKEN HIBITORS CAN INDEED SHIFT MOOD AND APPETITE BUT CONNALSOR SHIFT LEBIDO AND OTHER THINGS IT'S BECAUSE THEIR CERETONA RECEPTORS EVERYWHERE ER I SHOULD SAY MANY PLACES NOT JUST IN THE ARRIES OF THE BRAIN THEIR ASSOCIAT WITH MOOD FOR INSTANCE AND AS I MENTION BEFORE AGENTS WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE RECREATIONAL OR ELICIT DRUGS OR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS OR SUPPLEMENTS THAT INCREASED OPAMAN WILL ALSO BE BROAD BANDON HIT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CIRCUITS IN PARALLEL SO THIS IS WHY I ALWAYS SAY BEHAVERAL TOOLS REALLY SHOULD COME FIRST I DON'T SAY THAT BECAUSE I DISLIKE PHARMOCOLOGA SAID THAT BECAUSE IN MANY CASES BEHAVIORAL TOOLS ARE NOT ONLY SAFER AND EASIER TO TITRATE TO ADJUST THE DURATION ET CETERA THEN IS PHARMOCOLOGY BUT ALSO BECAUSE THEY CAN SOMETIMES AS IN THE CASE THE STUDY WHE IST DESCRIBED AFFORD YOU MORE SPECIFICITY NOT LESS THEN PHARMOCOLOGY PHARMOCOLOGY HAS ITS PLACE CAN BE WONDERFUL PROVIDED SAFE AND LEGAL ET CETERA BUT IT CAN CAUSE A LOT OF SO CALLED OFF TARGET EFFECTS SO FOR THOSE WHO THER INTERESTING INCREASING CREATIVITY THROUGH PHARMOCOLOGY I WOULD SAY STAY TUNED FOR THE DATA ON SYLICIBRON AND MICRODOSING SYLICIBON IF YOU ARE ABSOLUTELYE OBSESSED WITH THE IDEA OF MICRODOSING SYLICIBON FOR ENHANCING CREATIVITY AND YOU LIKE TO GO STRAIGHT TO THE STUDY I WILL TELL YOU WHAT THAT STUDY IS AND THEREFORE YOU CAN ACCESS SOME OF THE SPECIFICS AND TERMS A DOSAGINAN PROTOCOLS ET CETERA SO SINCE IT CAN'T HELP MY SELFLOGES VERY BRIEFLY SUMMARIZED THAT MICRODOSING PSYCHODELIC STUDY THE TITLE IS STUDY WHICH WAS PUBLISHING TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IS EXPLORING THE EFFECT OF MICRODOSING PSYCHODELICS ON CREATIVITY IN AN OPEN LABEL NATURAL SETIC A INTERESTING TITLE THIS WAS A MICRODOSING EVEN TO ORGANIZED BY THE DUTCH PSYCHODELIC SOCIETY THEY EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF PSYCHODELIC TRUFFLS WHERE THEY KNEW WHAT SORTS OF PSYCHODELIC COMPOUNDS WERE CONTAIN THERE ON TWO CREATIVITY RERELATED PROBLEM SOLVING TASK THE PICTURE CONCEPTASK WHICH I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO RECOGNIZE OR NO BUT IT ASSESS IS CONVERGENT THINKING AND THE ALTERNATIVE USES TASK WHICH I ALSO DON'T EXPECT YOU TO KNOW BUT IS A STANDARTASS FOR ACESSING DIVERGEN THINKING THEY TESTED ONCE BEFORE TAKING A MICRODOSE AND WHILE THE EFFECTS WERE EXPECTED TO BE MANIFESTED THEY SAY INTERESTING THEY USE THE WORD MANIFESTED IN A STUDY OF PSYCHODELICS SCIENCE IS CHANGING INDEED IN ANY CASE WHAT THEY FOUND WAS AN ENHANCEMENT OF CREATIVE THAT IS DIVERGENT AND CONVERGEN THINKING NOT SURPRISING GIVING THE FACT THAT THE FIVE AH T TO A RECEPTOR ACTIVITY IS INCREASED BY MICRODOSING A SYLICIBON AND FIVE AH T TO A RECEPTORS ARE PRESENT BOTH ON THE NARAL CIR ITS THE UNDERLIGHT DIVERGENT AND CONVERGENT THINKING AGAIN THIS IS NOT A PLUG FOR MICRODOSING SYLICIBAN THIS IS REALLY IN RESPONSE TO WHAT I KNOW WILL BE A NUMBER OF DIFREN QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT SORTS OF FHARMOCLOGIC AGENTS CAN BE USED TO INCREASE CREATIVITY SO MORE ON THAT LATER AND AGAIN WILL PROVIDE A LINK IF YOU WANT TO READ THAT STUDY IN MORE DEPTH I CAN IMAGINE THAT A NUMBER OF YOU ARE POBABLY ALSO WONDERING ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHL IN THE EFFECTS OF CANABUTS ON CREATIVITY WE DID A LONG INDEPTH THE EPISODE ALL ABOUT ALCOHOL IN ITS EFFECTS ON HEALTH THE BOUTOM LINE ON ALCOHOL IS THAT IN EXCESS OF TWO DRINKS PER WEEK YOU'RE STARTING TO RUN INTO THE CANCER PROMOTING AND TOXIC EFFECTS OF ALCHOL I DIDN'T CHOOSE FOR THE ANSWER TO BE THAT BUT THAT'S WHAT THE DATA TELL US NOT TELLING I YOU CAN'T DRINK MORE THAN TWO DRINKS PER WEEK COME JUST SAYING THATIF OU'RE GOING TO DO THAT YOU SHOULD REALLY CONSIDER OFFSETTING THAT WITH SOME OTHER BEHAVIAL MEASURES ALL DISCUSSED IN THE EPISODE AND ALCOL AND DESPITE WHAT PEOPLE THINK THERE IS ABSOLUTELY ZERO ZERO EVIDENCE THAT ALCHOL INCREASES CREATIVITY HOWEVER BY WAY OF REDUCING ACTIVATION OF THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT ALCOHOL AND OTHER SUBSTANCES THAT REDUCE WHAT SCALLED AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL SCRIPTING THAT IS A NARRATIVE ABOUT OURSELVES S OR SELF AWARENESS THAT IT CAN ENHANCE DIVERGENT THINKING AT VERY LOW DOSES THIS MAKES SENSE DIVERGENT THINKING INVOLVES REMEMBERING CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE CAN USE AS ELEMENTS IN THE CRETIVE PROCESS BUT SUPPRESSING NARRATIVES ABOUT WHAT THE USE OF THOSE WOULD MEAN WILL PEOPLE LIKE IT WILL THEY NOT LIKE IT WILL T LEAD TO THE ALCOME WE WANT WILL IT WON'T ALL OF THAT AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL SCRIPTING INVOLVES THE FOREBRAIN BEING VERY VERY ACTIVE AND SPECIFIC REGIENS THE FORE BRAIN IN PARTICULAR AND THAT ALL NEEDS TO BE SUPPRESSED WHICH ALCOHOL IN VERY LODOSES CAN ACCOMPLISH BUT AGAIN THAT'S NOT A PLUG FOR ALCHOL HI THINK OF BEHAVRIAL TOOLS WOULD BE MUCH BETTER ROUT BUT IT THEREFORE SHOULDN BE SURPRISING WHY SOME PEOPLE HAVE USED LODOS ALCOL IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN THE CREATIVE PROCESS BECAUSE INVOLVES LESS INABITION OR SENSE OF SELF THAY CAND BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE DIVERGENT THINKING PROCESS NOW WITH RESPECT TO CANABUS I WENT IN DEPTH INTO THE BIOLOGY AND THE VARIOUS USES MISUSES DANGERS END IN SOME CASES BENEFITS OF CANABUS USE IN CERTAIN KEEWHERE THERE IS CERTAIN POPULATIONS AND I ALSO DOVE INTO WEATHER NOT CANABUSTS CAN BE USED TO INCREASE DIVERGENT IN CONVERGENT THINKING SO THAT'S TIME STAMPED IN THAT EPISODE ALL WERE FREE TO THAT EPISODE BUT THE LONG AND SHORT OF IT IS THAT MANY OF THE IDEAS THAT PEOPLE COME UP WITH WHEN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CANABUS IN PARTICULAR HIT CONTAINING CANIBUS DOES LEAD TO ENHANCE DIVERGENT THINKING BUT SO ENHANCED IT TURNS OUT THAT OFTENTIMES THOSE IDEAS CAN'T BE CONSTRAINED BY THE CONVERGED THINKING PROCESS AN OTHERWORDS THEY E LOTS OF IDEAS THAT MAKE SENSE WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CANABUS BUT THAT LATER CANNOT BE IMPLEM MENTED INTO A COHERENT FRAME WORK THAT LEADS TO ANY ACTUAL CREATIVE ENDEAVOR OR CREATIVE PRODUCT OR AS IS OFTEN THE CASE WITH CANIBUS THEY SIMPLY CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT THEY WERE THINKING ABOUT ANY TIME THERE'S A DISCUSSION ABOUT DOPEMINE THERE SEEMS TO BE A DISCUSSION ABOUT MOTIVATION DESIRE AND DRIVEIN F COURSE THAT MAKE SENSE GIVEN THE ROLLS OF DOPEMINE WE DIDN'T ENTIRE EPISODE ON DOPEMING MOTIVATION AND DRIVE ITS ONE OF OUR MOST POPULAR EPISODES AGAIN YOU CAN ACCUS THAT WITH TIMESTAMPS IN ALL FORMATS AT HUBERMN LABEDOUT COME AN ANY TIME THERE'S A DISCUSSION ABOUT DOPOMINE AND MOTIVATION WE ALSO SEEM TO HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT ATTENTION AND FOCUS AND EIGHTY EIGHT OR ATTENTION DEPHISAT HYPORACTIVITY DISORDER IN PARTICULAR SO JUST AS A BRIEF MENTION THERE IS A LITERATURE ALTHOUGH NOT TERRIBLY EXTENSIVE A SMALL BUT STRONG LITERATURE ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EIGHTY EIGHT AND CREATIVITY AND THE LONG AND SHORT OF THAT LITERATURE IS THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE EIGHTY EIGHT REGARDLESS OF AGE DO SEEM TO HAVE AN ABILITY TO FOCUS I'VE MENTION THAT IN THE EPISODE ON EIGHTY EIGH S PROVIDED THAT THEY ARE INTERESTED IN THE THING THAT THEY ARE FOCUSING ON SO THAT RUNS COUNTER TO THIS IDEA THAT PEOPLE WITH EIGHT EIGHT SH SIMPLY CAN'T FOCUS THEY CAN BUT IT TENDS TO BE A FOCUS THAT SELECTIVE FOR THINGS THAT THEY ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT OR INTERESTED IN AS UPPOSED TO A GENERAL ABILITY TO FOCUS WHAT'S ALSO HIGHLY UNDER APPRECIATED IS THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE EIGHTY T OFTEN TIMES ARE VERY EFFECTIVE AT DIVERGEN THINKING BUT ARE LESS EFFECTIVE AT CONVERGENT THINKING WHAT THIS TELLS US IS THAT PEOPLE WITH EGHTY  CAN OFTEN HAVE EXCELLENT NOVEL AND INDEED CREATIVE IDEAS BUT THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE CREATIVE IDEAS IS SOMETIMES CHALLENGE AND THAT'S ONE REASON TO EXPLORE RATIONAL PHARMOCOLOGY NUTRITION SUPPLEMENTATION ET CETERA THOSE OR ALL THINGS TO EXPLORE IN CONCERT WITH OR I SHOULD SAY IN WORKING CLOSELY WITH A BOARD CERTIFIED PHYSICION OR IDEALLY PCYCHITROS EXPERT IN EIGHTY EIGHTU CAN ALSO CHECK OUT THE EPISODE THAT WE DID ON EIGHTY EIH SE THEIR LOT OF TOOLS THERE BOT OF SCIENCE MENTION THERE TO SUPPORT THOSE TOOLS AGAIN YOU CON FIND THAT HUBRUM LABDOT COM BUT I DID THINK IT WAS IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT EVEN IF BRIEFLY THAT HAVING GT T IS NOT A BARRIER TO CREATIVITY IN FACT MAY ACTUALLY BE AN ENHANCED PORTAL TO CREATIVITY BUT THAT IT DOESN'T ALLOW PEOPLE TO ACCESS THE CONVERGENT THINKING THAT ALLOWS CRETIVE IDEAS TO BE IMPLEMENTED INTO SPECIFIC STRATEGIES PRESSURE TESTED AND EVENTUALLY DELIVERED IN THE FORM OF A FINAL PRODUCT OF MUSIC ART ET CETERA THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT PEOPLE WITH EGHT EIHT S CANNOT ACCOMPLISH THAT BUT THAT IT IS GOING TO REQUIRE SOME ADDITIONAL STEPS AND PROTOCALS IN ORDER G TO ENHANCE CONVERGENT THINKING IND THAT EPISODE AN THE EPISODE THAT WE DID ON FOCUS AND IN PARTICULAR TOOLS TO ENHANCE FOCUS IS VERY MUCH DIRECTED AT WAYS TO ENHANCE CONVERGENT THINKING SO IF YOU HAVE AD SOR KNOW SOMEBODY WHO DOES IN INTEREST IN THE CREATIVE PROCESS OR FOCUSING GENERALLY PLEASE CHECK OUT THE EPISODES THAT I MENTION OTHERE'S ALSO A SMALL BUT NONE THE LESS VERY EXCITING LITERATURE ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PHYSICAL MOVEMENT AND DIVERGENT THINKING THIS SHOULD COME IS NO SURPRISE TO US AS MENTION MANY TIMES NOW IN THIS EPISODE THE NIGROSTRITO PATHWAY INVOLVED IN DIVERGENT THINKING THAT INVOLVES DOPENING IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR IBLINKS AND FOR MOVEMENTS OF THE LIMBS OF THE BODY IN VERY DELIBERATE WAYS THIS TELLS US THAT THERE'S SOME DIRECT OR MAY BE INDIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MOVEMENT OF THE BODY AND DIVERGENT THINKING AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT'S ONLY A FEW STUDIES THERE HAVE BEEN SOME STUDIES OF WHEATHER NOT PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO ENGAGE IN DIVERGEN THINKING MORE EFFECTIVELY WHEN THEY ARE DOING THINGS LIKE PACING OR WALKING AND THIS COUN BE ON A TREAD MILL OR BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE ROOM AND IN FACT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY THE CASE IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY LIKE MYSELF WHO TENDS TO HAVE THEIR BEST IDEAS NOT SAYING THAT MY YEAS ARE ALWAYS TERRIFIC BUT THAT AMONG THE IDEAS I HAVE SOME OF THE BETTER ONES ARRIVED TO ME WHILE ON MY LONG SUNDAY RUN ITON TO LONG RUNE OR HEIKE ON SUNDAYS SOMETIMES WITH E LIGHT WEIGHT VEST OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT BUT WHEN I'M IN A STATE OF ESSENTALLY NOT DIRECTING MY ATTENTION TO ANY ONE THING IN MY EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT THIS IS EXTREMELY KEY FOR REASONS THAT NOW SHOULD BE OBVIOUS ANY TIME WE ARE DIRECTING OUR ATTENTION TO A VISUAL TARGET ERE IN AUDITORY TARGET WE ARE NOT AS ABLE TO ENGAGE IN DIVERGEN THINKING THIS IS WHY I WILL SOMETIMES LISTEN TO POD CASTS OR TO AUDIO BOOKS WHILE I GO ON THESE RUNS BUT FOR PORTIONS OF THESE RUNS OR HIGHS ITEND TO TURN THOSE OFF AND JUST FOCUS ON THE MOVEMENT AND FOCUS ON NOT FOCUSSING ON ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR AND OFTENTIMES I WILL STOP AND WRIGHT DOWN IDEAS THAT SUDDENLY OR SEEMINGLY SUDDENLY A APPEAR TO ME OR OR GUISER TO THE SURFACE I'LL HAVE AN IDEA SOMETIMES THOSE A GOOD IDEAS SOMETIMES LESS GOOD IDEAS THE FACT THAT THAT HAPPENS FOR ME IN THAT FACT THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE PACERS OR RUNNERS ARE COME UP WITH THEIR BEST IDEAS WHILE IN THE SHOWER OR WHILE ENGAGING IN ACTIVITIES THAT DON'T REQUIRE A LOT OF SENSORY ATTENTION TO ONE SPECIFIC LOCATION EITHER VISUAL OR AUDITORY ET CETERA THAT IS BECAUSE IT ENGAGES THESE NIGROSTRADOL PATHWAYS THROUGH MOVEMENT WHICH THEN OPENS UP THIS LIBRARY OF IDEAS AND ALLOWS THE INTERSECTION OF DIFFERENT IDEAS THAT NORMALLY WOULD BE CONSTRAINED TO SEPARATE CATEGORIES ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS BY ANALOGY WOULD BE YOU KNOW AN WAS AKID YOU'D GO THE LIBRARY AND NOW DAYSY TO SCO ON LINE BUT THE DIFFERENT PAGES OF DIFFERENT BOOKS ON DIFFERENT TOPICS ARE KEPT DISTINCT FROM ONE ANOTHER THAT IS BOUND BY DIFFERENT BOOK COVERS AND BOOK ENDS DIFFERENT SHELVES IN THE LIBRARY IT'S AS IF DIFFERENT PAGES AND ELEMENTS FROM THOSE BOOKS ARE NOW BEING COMBINED IN A PSEUDO RANDOM NOT RANDOM BUT IN A PSEUDO RANDOM WAY AND IN THAT COMMINATION NEW POSSIBILITIES ABOUT WAYS THAT INFORMATION COULD BE COMBINED AN IMPLEMENTED START TO ARISE SO THE TOOL THAT EMERGES FROM THIS IS VERY SIMPLE AND IT WON'T NECESSARILY APPLY TO EVERYBODY BUT IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO FINDS THAT JUST SITTING IN A CHAIR AND TRYING TO BE CREATIVE IS VERY CHALLENGING SOME OF YOU MIGHT BENEFIT FROM FOR INSTANCE IF YOU ARE ENGAGING IN WRITING OR YOU WANT TO WRIT TO TALK INTO THE VOICE RECORDER OF YOUR PHONE WHILE WALKING OR SIMPLY WALKING AND NOT ATTENDING TO ANY ONE SPECIFIC THING VISUALLY OR THROUGH EDPHONES AND THEN AS IDEAS SURFACE SEEMINGLY OUT OF NOWHERE WHICH IS HOW IT HAPPENS THAT YOU COULD EITHER PUT THEM INTO YOUR PHONE BY VOICE DICTATION OR YOU COUL TYPE THEM OUT IF YOU LIKE THE KEYTHING IS TO NOT BE DISTRACTED BY OTHER THINGS IN YOUR PHONE NOT TO START GOING ON TO SOCIAL MEDEAOR DOING PHONE CALLS OR LOOKING AT TEXMESAGES BECAUSE THAT BY DEFINITION IS GOING TO TAKE YOU OUT OF THIS O WHAT THE BIOLOGIST CALL A PSEUDO RANDOM WALK AND THIS PSEUDORANDOM ELEMENT IS ETREMELY IMPORTANT WE KNOW FOR INSTANCE THAT MANY CIRCUITS WITHIN THE BRAIN HAVE WHATS CALLED DEDICATED POINT TO POINT WIRING SO FER INSANCE THE BRAIN CIRCUITS THAT GOVERN YOUR BREATHING THE BRAIN CIRCUITS THAT GOVERN YOUR HEART BEAT THE BRAIN CIRCUITS THAT GOVERN YOUR SPECIFIC MOVEMENTS ONCE YOU ARE AND ADULT AND ALLOW FOR PSMOOTH DIRECTED MOVEMENT ARE VERY PRECISE VERY LITTLE SLOP IF ANY IN THE WIRING HOWEVER THERE ARE ASPECTS OF YOUR BRAIN CIRCUITRY YOURS AND EVERYBODY ELSE'S I SHOULD SAY THAT ARE MAINTAINED INTO ADULTHOOD THAT INCLUDE A LOT OF EXTRA WIRING AND THIS THESE ARE FINE WIRES OS NOT THE MAJOR HIGHWAYS BETWEEN DIFFERENT AIREAS IF YOU WILL THE SORE LIKE GUGOMAPS HAS HIGHWAYS AND STREETS AND LITTLE LITTLE UM PASSAGES AND ALLEYS BUT IT'S AS IF THERE'S A LITTLE WEB OF ADDITIONAL POSSIBLE PATHWAYS CAST OVER THAT ENTIRE THING THE HUMAN BRAIN MAINTAINS SUCH WEBS OF POSSIBLE PASSAGE AND IT'S ONLY DURING ACTIVITIES SUCH AS WALKING RUNNING CYCLING SWIMMING HICHING PACING ET CETERA THAT THE ACTIVATION OF THOSE PSEUDO RANDOM PATHWAYS STARTS TO RAMP UP SO THIS IS A PURELY BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO ENGAGING DIFFERENT ELEMENTS WITHIN NURAL NETWORKS THAT NORMALLY WOULD NOT COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER WHEN WE ARE COMPLETELY STILL SO AGAIN THE PRACTICES I TALK ABOUT EARLIER OF BEING COMPLETELY STILL TO RAISE DOPAMINE AND ENHANCE DIVERGENT THINKING THOSE I JUST WANT O RE EMPHASIZE ARE DESINE TO POSITION YOU TO READY YOU TO ENGAGE IN THE KINDS OF ACTIVITIES LIKE WALKING AND PACING ET CETERA THAT BEST FACILITATE DIVERGENT THINKING SO IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO ENHANCE DIVERGEN THINKING I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO EXPLORE HOW DIFFERENT PATTERNS OF MOVEMENT AND PARTICULAR PATTERNS OF MOVEMENT THAT DON'T REQUIRE ANY CONSCIOUS ATTENTION TO ANY ONE SPECIFIC THING ALLOW YOU TO ACCESS NEW IDEAS AND NEW WAYS OF COMBINING EXISTING ELEMENTS IN WHATEVER DOMAIN IT IS YOU WANT TO BE CREATIVE NOW THIS IS ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSCORE SOMETHING I SAID BACK AT THE BEGINNING WHICH IS YOU ARE NOT GOING TO COME UP WITH GREAT WORKS OF MUSIC IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND CORDS AND MELODIES AND NOTES AND MUSIC THOSE BASIC ELEMENTS HAVE TO BE BUILT UP THROUGH SOME SORT OF FORMAL OR AT LEAST RIGOROUS OR REGULAR TRAINING THE SAME WAY THAT YOU'RE NOTKING TO TAKE A WALK AND THEN SUDDENLY BE ABLE TO PAINT AN INCREDIBLE PICTURE IF YOU HAVE NO PAINTING ABILITY THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN WHAT I'M TALKING I HEARE ARE WAYS TO ENHANCE YOUR CAPACITY FOR DIVERGENT THINKING SUCH AS ANNESTY ARE AND WAYS TO ENGAGE IN DIVERGENT THINKING SUCH AS THROUGH  CERTAIN FORMS OF MOVEMENT THAT DON'T REQUIRE A LOT OF CONSCIOUS ATTENTION TO YOUR SURROUNDINGS OR ANY ONE SPECIFIC CENSURY TARGET AND IN DOING SO ENHANCING ERABILITY TO BE MORE CREATIVE IN A DOMAIN FOR WHICH YOU ALREADY HAVE SOME DEGREE OF SKILL OR EVEN MASTERY NOW IN KEEPING WITH THE THEME OF HOW TO ENHANCE OUR CREATIVITY THERE'S A VERY EXCITING AND YET PARALLEL LITERATURE TO THE LITERATURE THAT I'VE BEEN DESCRIBING THUS FAR NOW I PROMISE YOU THAT I'M NOCK IN O OPEN UP AN ENTIRE LIBRARY OF NEW INFORMATION RELATE TO NURL CIRCUITS AND SO FORTH BUT I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T MENTION THIS PARALLEL LITERATURE BECAUSE IT SPEAKS VERY SPECIFICALLY TO SOME IMPORTANT PRACTICES THAT WE CAN ALL USE IN ORDER TO ENHANCE CREATIVITY AND TO DO SO THE FIRST TIME AND EVERY TIME AND THIS IS REALLY BECAUSE CERTAIN SCIENTISTS OUT THERE HAVE REALLY GONE THROUGH THE TROUBLE I HOULD EVEN SAY THE PAINSTAKING TROUBLE OF REALY TRYING TO DISECT WHAT THE CREATIVE PROCESS IS BOTH FOR INDIVIDUALS AND IN GROUPS OR EVEN IN PAIRS AND SO WHAT I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU IS BEAUTIFULLY INCAPSULATED IN AN ARTICLE IN TITLE A NEW METHOD FOR TRAINING CREATIVITY NARRATIVE AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO DIVERGENT THINKING AGAIN WE BENT TIE ABOUT DIVERGENT THINKING THAT'S ONE PATHWAY INTO THE CREATIVE PROCESS BUT THERE ARE OTHERS AS WELL AND AS IT TURNS OUT THEYRE NOT SO DISTINCT IN TERMS OF THE UNDERLYING BRAIN MECHANISMS NONE THE LESS LEME DESCRIBE BRIEFLY HOW NARRATIVE CAN BE USED TO TRAIN CREATIVITY AND TO BECOME MORE CREATIVE AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT I LIKE TO JIS BRIEFLY PARAPHRASE OR READ FROM THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THIS PAPER SO WHAT I'M ABOUT TO READ ARE THE AUTHORS WORDS NOT MINE QUOTE HERE'S A PARADOX ACCORDING TO CURRENT RESEARCH YOUNG CHILDREN ARE MORE IMAGINATIVELY CREATIVE THAN ADULTS AND INDEED THAT IS TRUE BY THE WAY YET ALSO ACCORDING TO CURRENT RESEARCH CREATIVITYES MAINNURAL ENGINE IS DIVERGENT THINKING WHICH RELIES ON MEMORY AND LOGICAL ASSOCIATION TWO TASKS WHICH YOUNG CHILDREN UNDER PERFORM ADULTS THAT IS CHILDREN ARE NOT AS GOOD AT DIVERGENT THINKING AS ADULTS ARE SO HOW COULD IT BE THE AUTHORS ARE ASKING THAT CHILDREN ARE MORE IMAGINATIVE AND THUS MORE CREATIVE THAN ADULTS THIS CAN ONLY MEAN THAT THERE ARE ALTERNATE PATHWAYS TO CREATIVITY AND INDEED THAT IS THE CASE AND SO WHAT THIS PAPER REALLY EXPLORES IS OTHER WAYS TO ACCESS CREATIVITY IN WHAT THEY DESCRIBE IS WHAT'S CALLED NARRATIVE THEORY AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ASPECTS TO THIS NARRATIVE THEORY BUT THEY AGREE THAT THE STANDARD DEFINITION OF CREATIVITY IS THE SAME ONE THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE SO ERE NOT SANG ABOUT A DIFFERENT FORM OF CREATIVITY HERE WHICH I CAMOUT A DIFFERENT WAY TO ACCESS CREATIVITY THEY DESCRIBE THE STANDARD DEFINITION OF CREATIVITY AS QUOTE THE ABILITY TO GENERATE NOVEL IDEAS THAT ARE USEFUL SO THE COMMONLY AXCEPTN ONE AND WHAT THEY SITE AS THE BASIST FOR NARRATIVE THEORY IS THIS BREAK THROUGH FINDING IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES IS IS THE WORK OF GUILFORD SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE MIGHT BE FAMILIAR WITH IT I WAS NOT AT THE OUTSET OF RESEARCHING THIS EPISODE WHAT THIS THEORY IS FROM GUILFORD ESSENTIALLY STATES IS THAT THEIARE DIFFERENT INTELLECTUAL CAPACITIES THAT ARE NOT CAPTURED BY STANDARD ICUTES I THINK THAT'S GE NERALLY ACCEPTED NOWADAYS WE KNOW THERE IS EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE WE KNOWS TE STANDARD I CUE ET CETERA BUT THE IMPORTANT ELEMENT TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT THESE AUTHORS WE'RE ABLE TO TRACE BACK THE IDEA OF NARRATIVE TRAINING AS A WAY TO ENHANCE CREATIVITY LONG BEFORE GUILFORD IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES ALL THE WAY BACK TO ARISTOTLE THIS SO THIS IS INCREDIBLE NARRATIVE THEORY WAS ACTUALLY BIRTH IN THREE THIRTY FIVE B C E IN HIS WRITING CALLED POETICS WHICH I THINK IS INCREDIBLE AT LEAST TO ME THAT PEOPLE LONG BEFORE US WERE THINKING ABOUT CREATIVITY IND WHAT GOES INTO CREATIVITY AND WHAT ARISTOTLE SAID WHAT GUILFORD THEN ELABORATED ON IN WHAT THE AUTHORS OF THIS PAPER FURTHER ELABORATE ON AND ACTUALLY HAVE DEVELOPED TRAINING PROTO CALLS FOR IS THE IDEA THAT THERE ARE THREE ELEMENTS THAT WE CAN USE IN ORDER TO ENHANCE CREATVITY IN THOSE THREE ELEMENTS ARE WHAT'S CALLED WORLD BUILDING I'LL EXPLAIN WHIT THESE ARE IN A MOMENT PERSPECTIVE SHIFTING AND ACTION GENERATING AND RIGHT OFF THE BAT THE WORD ACTION SHOULD RAISE A FLAG FOR YOU AND BY THAT I MEAN A POSITIVE FLA BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN WE ARE BACK INTO THE WORLD AND THEREFORE THE NORL CIRCUITS OF MOVEMENT AND MOTION O CASE O THREE ELEMENTS OF WORLD BUILDING PERSPECTIVE SHIFTING AND ACTIVE GENERING OR WHAT MAKE UP THIS NARRATIVE APPROACH TO CREATIVITY AND I SHOULL MENTION THAT THESE AUTHORS AND OTHERS ARE USING SUCH APPROACH WITH COMPANIES WITH GROUPS WITH INDIVIDUALS SO THIS IS USE IN A BUNCH OF IFFERENT CONTECTS TO APPROACH AND ENHANCE DIFFERENT FORMS OF CREATIVITY SO LET'S TALK FIRST ABOUT WORLD BUILDING TECHNIQUES THIS IS GOING TO BE IMMEDIATELY FAMILIAR TO YOU WHEN YOU HEAR IT BUT ONE OF THE KEY ELEMENTS OF CREATIVITY IS TO AT THE OUTSET COME UP WITH SOME IDEA THAT MAKE SENSE OR AS ATTRACTIVE TO YOU ABOUT HOW THE WORLD IS DIFFERENT INSIDE OF YOUR CREATIVE ENDEAVOR SO FOR THOSE THAT WRITE SCIENCE FICTION OR THINK ABOUT SCIENCE FICTION THERE SOME OBVIOUS ASPECTS TO THIS BUT FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT DON'T MAYBE YOU COME UP WITH A NARRATIVE FOR INSTANCE IN THE CONTECTS OF STORY TELLING THAT IN YOUR WORLD A WE ARE THE HOUSE CATS AND THE CATS ARE ACTUALLY THE ONES THAT ARE THE CURATORS OF THE EARTH O CASE A RIGHT THERE THERE IS A CONCEPTIUAL SHIFT THAT THE WORLD IN WHICH WHATEVER CREATIVE IDEA IS GOING TO EMERGE IS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT THAN THE ONE THAT WE ACTUALLY LIVIN SO THAT SETS A CERTAIN NUMBER OF IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS IT MEANS CERTAIN THINGS ARE NOW POSSIBLE OTHER THINGS ARE NOT POSSIBLE THAT EVERY DIFFERENT FROM THE WORLD THAT WE LIV IN YOU CAN SEE THE PARALLELS HERE TO KIND OF CHILDHOOD IMAGINATION WHERE ESSENTIALY ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IN THE CHILD'S MIND BECAUSE THEY ARE UN CONSTRAIN THE SECOND ELEMENT IS THIS PERSPECTIVE SHIFTING TECHNIQUES AND THE IDEA HERE IS THAT NOT ONLY ARE WE SPOSED TO HAVE THE READER OR THE LISTENER OR THE OBSERVER OR US EXPLORE FOR CREATIVITY AND DEVELOP A CREATIVE IDEA BY THINKING DIFFERENTLY RIGHT WHICH IS KIND OF A GENERIC TURM HOW TO WE ACTUALLY THINK DIFFERENTLY BUT RATHER THAN JUST SAY TAKE THE PERSPECTIVE OF SOMEBODY ELSE IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY WOULD SEE OR DO OR SAY OR THINK RATHER WE ARE SUPPOSED TO THINK ABOUT THEIR UNDERLYING MOTIVATION SO WE COULD DO THE WORLD SHIFT THAT IS THE WORLD STRUCTURE SHIFT FROM STEP ONE AND THEN IN STEP TOO YOU WOULD ASK YOURSELF O K RATHER THAN RIGHT ABOUT OR THINK ABOUT OR MOVE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF MY SELF LET SAY YOUR FEELING PARTICULARLY HAPPY THAT DAY YOU'D SAY YOU KNOW I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO TAKE THE PERSPECTIVE OF SOMEBODY WHO'S ANGRY BUT RATHER THAN JUST ACT ANGRY I'M GOING TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THEIR MOTIVATION FOR BEING ANGREAS MAY BE THEY HAD A BREAK UP MAYBE THEY WERE JEALOUS MAY BE SOMEBODY HAD WRONGED THEM IN SOME WAY MAY BE THEIRE JUST GENERALLY ANGRY AT THE WORLD FOR WHATEVER REASON AND THEN OPERATE FROM THAT MOTIVATIONAL STANCE AND THIS IS AF HERY INTERESTING AND POWERFUL STEP BECAUSE WHAT IT REALLY CAPTURES AT LEAST AS VIEWED BY ME THE NERROL SCIENTISTS IS IT CAPTURES A WHOLE SET OF NERRAL CIRCUITS ABOUT WHAT THAT MOTIVATIONAL STATE MEANS BECAUSE MOTIVATIONAL STATES DICTATE A HUGE NUMBER OF POSSIBLE DIFFERENT OUTCOMES BUT THEY REALLY CONSTRAIND THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ACTIONS IN OUTCOMES THAN ANY OF US WOULD ENGAGE IN RATHER THAN SAYING I'M GOING TO VIEW THE WORLD THE WAY THAT SOME ONE ELSE OR VIEW THE WORLD BY STATING THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE MOTIVATED BY THEIR SET OF MOTIVATIONS AND NOT OUR OWN IT INCLUDES A LOT MORE POSSIBILITIES AND YET NOT AN INFINITE NUMBER OF POSSIBITY THEY ARE CONSTRAINED IN A LOGICAL WAY WHICH IS ONE OF THE KEY ELEMENTS OF CREATIVITY AND THEN THE THIRD ELEMENT WHICH IS ACTION GENERATING TECHNIQUES IS A REALLY COOL ONE THAT YOU WILL IMMEDIATELY NOTICE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE WORK PLACE WHICH IS FORCED COLLABORATION SO INSIDE IE THIS THING THAT WERE BUILDING HERE O THIS KIND OF STORY YOU CREATE A NOVEL RULE FOR THE WORLD THAT THEOUR STORIES GOING TO EXIST IN OR YOUR MUSIC IS GOING TO EXIST IN OR YOUR SPORT WILL EXIST IN THEN YOU CREATE THIS PERSPECTIVE SHIFT WHERE YOU TAKE ON THE MOTIVATION OF SOME ONE ELSE DIFFERENT THAN YOU AND THEN YOU FORCE COLLABORATION BETWEEN THAT PERSON WHO HAS THIS ULL ALTERNATE MOTIVATION DIFFERENT FROM YOU AND SOME ONE ELSE WHO HAS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT MOTIVATION AND IN DOING SO YOU CREATE THESE KIND OF WHAT ARE CALLED CREATIVE COLLISIONS NOW THERE COLLISIONS BECAUSE THEY'RE CROSSING ONE ANOTHER IN SOMETHING NEW HAS TO EMERGE FROM THEM THEY COULD BE ANTAGONISTIC RE ARGUMENTS FIGHTING PHYSICAL OR VERBAL OR OTHERWISE THEY COULD BE SYNERGISTIC THEY COULD TAKE ON ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FORMS DEPENDING ON THE MOTIVATIONS AND THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE INVOLVE BUT EVEN THOUGH I JUST DESCRIBE THIS INFAIRILY TOP CONTOUR WHAT I JUST DESCRIBED IS ACTUALLY THE CORPS ELEMENTS OF ANY STORY OR ANY CREATIVE ENDEAVORITS JUST THAT MANY STORIES ARE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW AND BELIEVE AND THINK THE WORLD TO BE AND OUR OWN PERSPECTIVE AND THE ACTIONS THAT WE WOULD TAKE GIVEN THAT WORLD THAN THAT PERSPECTIVE WHEREAS IF WE WANT TO BE CREATIVE WE WANT TO THINK OUTSIDE OF OUR USUAL FRAME WORK AND YET USING ELEMENTS THAT EXIST WITHIN US RIGHT NO ONE HAS TO TELL US THE CREATIVE NARRATIVE WERE TRYING TO COME UP WITH IT ON OUR OWN WE WANT TO ESSENTIALLY THINK IN A CHILDLIKE WAY HOW DO CHILDREN THINK WELL THEY HAVE NEW DIFFERENT OR IN NTIRELY NOVEL CONCEPTS ABOUT HOW THE WORLD WORKS BUT THEYS ARE BOUNDED AND THIS IS A KEY WORD THOSE ARE BOUNDED THEY ARE NOT INFINITES NOT THAT ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN RIGHT SOME KIDS WILL AY WE CAN FLY AND YOU CAN SHOOT LAZERS AT OUR IZING CAN DO ALL SORTS OF THING UNICORNS A CANDY FALLING FROM THE SKY AT SOME POINT IF YOU DON'T BOUND THE CHANGE IN THE WORLD IT JUST BECOMES PURE CHAOS AND EVEN CHILDREN DON'T DO THAT S WE NEED TO BOUND THE CHANGE AND YET CREATE SOME ALTERNATE UNIVERSE IF YOU WILL IN WHICH THE STORY TAKES PLACE OR THE CREATION OF ANY KIND DOES NOT TO BE A STORY TAKES PLACE THEN THERE HAS TO BE A PERSPECTIVE SHIFT AND THIS IS VERY USEFUL THIS IS A ACTUALLY A TOOL THAT WE CAN ALL USE OF TRYING TO TAKE THE PERSPECTIVE OF OTHERS BUT NOT JUST ASKING WHAT THEY WOULD FEEL OR THINK OR DO BUT ASK WHAT IS THEIR MOTIVATION IN LIFE GENERALLY OR WHAT KIND OF MOOD STANDS OR GOALSTANCE ARE THEY TAKING ARE THEY TRYING TO EXTRACT FROM OTHERS ARE THEY TRYING TO GIVE TO OTHERS ARE THE VERY ALTERISTIC ET CETERA ET CETERA AND THEN YOU TAKE THAT INDIVIDUAL YOU DO THAT ALSO FOR ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS AND YOU START THINKING ABOUT HOW THOSE DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE OF THEIR DIFFERENT MOTIVATIONAL STATES WOULD ENGAGE AT THE LEVEL OF ACTION WHAT THEY WOULD DO WHAT THEY WOULD SAY WOUT THEY MATE WOUTD THEY FIGHT WOULD THEY ET SCETERA ET CETERA YOU THINK OF ANY STORY THE STORY OF STAR WARERS OF THE  THE GREEK MYTHS YOU THINK OF ANY STORY THAT HAS BEEN CREATED WHICH WE CONSIDER GREAT AND NOVEL WORKS AND YOU START TO FIND THESE THREE ELEMENTS WORLD BUILDING PERSPECTIVE SHIFTING AND ACTION GENERATING TECHNIQUES AND SO WHILE THIS IS AGAIN JUST A BROAD CONTOUR OF WHAT THIS NARRATIVE APPROACH INVOLVES THINKS A VERY IMPORTANT AND VERY EXCITING ONE BECAUSE IT GIVES US A FORMULA RIGHT WE ALREADY KNOW THAT DIVERGN THINKING AND CONVERGEN THINKING ARE BOTH ELEMENTS TO THE CREATIVE PROCESS THIS IS SUGGESTING THAT WHETHER NOT INVOLVES DIVERGEN THINKING OR NOT THESE AUTHORS SEEM TO THINK THIS IS DISTINCT FROM DIVERGENT THINKING THAT CAPTURING SOME OF THE ELEMENTS OF CREATIVITY THAT OURE PRESENT IN CHILDHOOD BUT THAT THEN TEND TO DIS APPEAR AS WE START TO ASSUME IDENTITY BUILD IDENTITY AND UNDERSTAND RULES ABOUT THEY ACTUAL WORLD WE LIVE IN ALL OF THOSE BASIC ELEMENTS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD CREATIVITY CAN BE REAWAKEND AND IN FACT THEY HAVE DATED TO SUPPORT THE FACT THAT THEY CAN BE REAWAKENED INEDULTS IN MEANINGFUL WAYS THAT CAN LEAD TO NEW PRODUCT DESIGN NEW WORKPLACE INTERACTIONS AND ON AND ON THAT I FIND VERY EXCITING AND AS A CONSEQUENCE I DO INTEND TO DO AN ENTIRE EPISODE AT SOME POINT ON NARRATIVE AND STORY TELLING AND THE ROLE OF NARRATIVE IN STORY TELLING NOT JUST FORSAKE OF CREATIVITY BUT ALSO FOR ACCESSING NURL PLASTICITY AND FOR ENHANCING MEMORY AND SO ON THERES AN ENTIRE LANDSCAPE OF LITERATURE AND EXCITING TOOLS AND THINGS TO UNDERSTAND THERE BUT IN THE MEAN TIME WE WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO THIS PAPER AND FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT CHOOSE NOT TO ACCESS THE PAPER SIMPLY UNDERSTANDING THESE THREE ASPECTS OF NARRATIVE AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO ACCESS ING CREATIVITY THAT IS A DEDICATED AND WELL UNDERSTOOD OR ESTABLISHED WORLD SHIFT THAT YOU CHOOSE PERSPECTIVE SHIFTING AND TAKING ON THE MOTIVATION OF OTHERS AND CREATING SOME SORT OF LANDSCAPE OF EXPLORATION FOR WHAT SORTS OF INTERACTIONS WOULD OCCUR BETWEEN THAT INDIVIDUAL OR GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE OTHER MOTIVATIONS AND YET ARE STILL LIVING IN THIS ALTERNATE WORLD THOSE THREE ELEMENTS WE NOW KNOW CAN BE COMBINED INTO WHAT YOU OR I OR ANYONE WOULD CONSIDER IMPORTANT CREATIVE WORKS SO TO DAY WE DISCUSSED CREATIVITY THIS ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING ASPECT TO HUMAN BRAIN FUNCTION THAT HAS ALLOWED US AS A SPECIES TO DEVELOP EVERYTHING FROM GREAT WORKS OF ART AND MUSIC TO TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS THAT ALLOW US TO FLY AND ALLOW US TO ACCESS PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD THROUGH LITTLE SCREEN DEVICES THAT WE CARRY ROUND IN OUR POCKETS AND ON AND ON AS I MENTIONED THE BEGINNING OF TO DAY'S EPISODE I FIND CREATIVITY TO BE ONE OF THE MOST FASCINATING ASPECTS OF BRAIN FUNCTION AND IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE WE DON'T ACTIALLY KNOW WHAT THE UPPER LIMITS OF CREATIVITY ARE AND YET WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN BOUNDS THERE ARE CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS AND THE KEY REQUIREMENT FOR CREATIVITY IS THIS ASPECT OF UTILITY NOW THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT FOR SOMETHING TO BE CONSIDERED CREATIVE IT HAS TO BE USEFUL IN THE PRACTICAL SENS BUT IT DOES SEEM THAT FOR SOMETHING TO BE CONSIDERED TRULY CREATIVE OR ESPECIALLY CREATIVE IN SOME CASES THAT IT REVEAL TO US SOMETHING FUNDAMENTAL ABOUT THE WAY THAT WE OR THE WORLD WORKS WE DISCUSS SOME OF THE NARL CIRCUITS THAT UNDERLIE THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF CREATIVITY IN PARTICULAR DIVERGENT AN CONVERGON THINKING AS WELL AS NARRATIVE BUILDING AND SOME OF THE TOOLS AND STEPS THAT CAN ALLOW US TO BETTER ACCESTS DIVERGEN THINKING AND CONVERGEN THINKING AND THOSE TOOLS INCLUDE BEHAVIRAL TOOLS AS WELL AS FARMOCOLOGY AND WE TALKED ABOUT NARRATIVE BUILDING AS A WAY TO REAWAKEN OR I SHOULD SAY REACCESTS THE CHILDHOOD CREATIVITY THAT DID INDEED EXIST IN ALL OF US AT SOME POINT IN TIME IF YOU'RE LEARNING

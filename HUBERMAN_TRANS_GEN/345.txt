WELCOME TO THE HUBERMANLAPONENS  A SCIENCE SCIENCEPACE TO IS FRLI  I MANDRUHUBERMAN AND ON A PROFESSOR OF NEUROBIOLOGY AND OPTHEMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY WE ARE DISCUSSING PLASIB EFFECTS WE WILL ALSO BE DISCUSSING WHAT ARE CALLED NO SEBO EFFECTS AS WELL AS BELIEF EFFECTS ALL THREE OF THESE PLASIBO NOSIBO AND BELIEF EFFECTS ARE ALL RELATED TO OUR BRAINS INCREDIBLE ABILITY TO PLACE AN EXPECTATION ON WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN AND ACTUALLY CHANGE WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN INDEPENDENT OF THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF A DRUG OR SOME SORT OF OTHER TREATMENT SOLUTION FOR THINGS LIKE PAIN PARKINSON'S DISEASE IRRITABLE BAWEL CYNDRUM ASMA STRESS AND ON AND ON AND ON NOW ONE OF THE MOST INCREDIBLE THINGS ABOUT THESE EFFECTS IS THAT DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THEY ARE SIMPLY PSYCHOLOGICAL OR THE POWER OF THE MIND OVER MATTER IT'S NOT THAT AT ALL PLASIBO NOSIBO AND BELIEF EFFECTS ACTUALLY CHANGE THE WAY YOUR BIOLOGY YOUR PHYSIOLOGY WORKS IN FACT YOU HAVE NURAL CIRCUITS WITHIN YOUR BRAIN THAT ARE DEDICATED TO HOW YOUR EXPECTATION OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN ACTUALLY CHANGES SOME OF THE MOST CORBIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS WITHIN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY MODIFYING FOR INSTANCE HEARTRATE BLOOD PRESSURE THE RELEASE OF SPECIFIC NEUROMOGULATOR SUCH AS DOPOMINE AND A DRENOLINE AND SO POWERFULLY SO THAT THESE TYPES OF EFFECTS CAN ACTUALLY WORK ALONG WITH TRADITIONAL DRUG TREATMENTS OR BEHAVIOUR AL TREATMENTS IN ORDER TO VASTLY CHANGE THE WAY THAT YOUR BRAIN AND BODY WORK SO IF YOU THINK OF THE WORD PLASIBO AS AND INERT SUBSTANCE OR TREATMENT THAT IS MERELY A CONTROL IT'S MERELY SOMETHING INTRODUCED TO AN EXPERIMENT OR A CLINICAL TRIAL TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING NORMALLY IN SOMEBODY'S BRAIN OR BODY AS A COMPARISON TO SOME DRUG OR OTHER TY P OF TREATMENT WELL WHILE THAT CAN BE TRUE AND PLACEBO CONTROLS ARE VITAL FOR CERTAIN CLINICAL STUDIES IT'S ALSO THE CASE THAT PLUSEBOS NO SEBOS AND BELIEF EFFECTS HAVE POWERFUL IMPACT ON OUR PHYSIOLOGY ENTIRELY SEPARATE FROM ALL OF THAT SO MUCH SO THAT SEVERAL HIGHLY ESTEEMED RESEARCHERS IN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY AROUND THE WORLD BELIEVE THAT PLASEBO NO SEBO AND BELIEF EFFECTS SHOULD ACTUALLY BE LEVERAGED IN THE TREATMENT OF VARIOUS DISEASES AS THEIR OWN UNIQUE TREATMENT SO BY THE END OF TO DAY'S EPISODE YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT PLACEBO NO SIBO AN BELIEF EFFECTS ARE THEIR BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS AND THE WAY THAT YOU CAN LEVERAGE THEM TOWARD YOUR MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE BEFORE WE BEGIN I LIKE EMPHASIZE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORT TO BRING ZERO COSTOC CONSUMEOR INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SIENSTULATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TODAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS EIGHT SLEEP EIGHT SLEEP MAKE SMART MATTRESS COVERS WITH COOLING HEATING AND SLEEP TRACKING CAPACITY HAVE SPOKEN MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE FACT THAT SLEEP IS THE FOUNDATION OF MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE NOW ONE OF THE KEY THINGS FOR GETTING A GREAT NIGHT SLEEP IS THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT FOR INSTANCE IN ORDER TO FALL AND STAY DEEPLY ASLEEP YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE NEEDS TO DROP BY ABOUT ONE TO THREE DEGREES AND IN ORDER TO WAKE UP FEELING REFRESHED YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE ACTUALLY HAS TO INCREASE BY ABOUT ONE TO THREE DEGREES WITH EIGHT SLEEP IT MAKES IT VERY EASY TO CONTROL THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR SLEEPING ENVIRONMENT YOU CAN DIALIN SPECIFIC TEMPERATURE RANGES FOR THE BEGINNING MIDDLE AND END OF YOUR NIGHT IT EVEN HAS A SLEEP TRACKER SO IT WILL TRACK YOUR SLOWWAVE SLEEP REMSLEEP TOTAL SLEEP AND GIVE YOU A SLEEP SCORE AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY DIVIDE THE MATTRESS INTO TWO DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES IF SOME ONE ELSE IN YOUR BED LIKES THINGS A DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE AND THEY OF COURSE CAN HAVE THEIR SLEEP TRACT INDEPENDENTLY OF YOURS IT'S AN ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL TOOL ITS COMPLETELY TRANSFORMED MY SLEEP SO MUCH SO THAT WHEN I TRAVEL TO HOTELS OR AERBIAN BEES I FIND I DON'T EVER SLEEP AS WELL AS WHEN I HAVE MY EIGHT SLEEP OT EVEN SHIPPED M I EIGHT SLEEP OUT TO THOSE PLACES THAT GETS A LOT COMPLICATED BUT THAT'S HOW MUCH I LOVE MY EIGHT SLEEP IT GIVES ME THE BEST POSSIBLE NIGHT SLEEP IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY EIGHT SLEEP YOU CAN GO TO EIGHT SLEEP DOC CALM SLASHHUBERMAN TO SAVE UP TO A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS OFF THEIR POD THREE COVER EIGHT SLEEP CURRENTLY SHIPS IN THE U S A CANDADA U K SELECT COUNTRIES IN THE EU AND AUSTRALIA AGAIN THAT'S EIGHT SLEEP DOC CAM SLASH HUBERMAN TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY AERO PRESS AERO PRESS IS SIMILAR TO A FRENCH PRESS FOR MAKING COFFEE BUT IS IN FACT A MUCH BETTER WAY TO MAKE COFFEE I FIRST LEARNED ABOUT ARO PRESS WELL OVER TEN YEARS AGO AND I'VE BEEN USING ONE EVER SINCES AERO PRESS WAS DEVELOPED BY ALLAN ADLER WHO WAS AN ENGINEER AT STAMFORD AND I KNEW OF ALLAN BECAUSE HE HAD ALSO BUILT THE SO CALLED AROBY FRISBY SO HE WAS SORT OF FAMOUS IN OUR COMMUNITY FOR DEVELOPING THESE DIFFERENT FEETS OF ENGINEERING THAT TURNED INTO COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS NOW I LOVE COFFEE I'M SOMEBODY THAT DRINKS COFFEE NEARLY EVERY DAY USUALLY ABOUT NINETY TO A HUNDRED TWENTY MINUTES AFTER I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING ALTHOUGH NOT ALWAYS SOMETIMES IF I'M GOING TO EXERCISE I'LL DRINK COFFEE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING BUT I LOVE LOVE LOVE COFFEE AND WHAT I'VE PERSONALLY FOUND IS THAT BY USING THE ARO PRESS I CAN MAKE THE BEST POSSIBLE TASTE IN CUP OF COFFEE I DON'T KNOW WHAT EXACTLY IT IS IN THE AERO PRESS THAT ALLOWS THE SAME BEINS TO BE PREPARED INTO A CUP OF COFFEE THAT TASTES THAT MUCH BETTER AS COMPARED TO ANY OTHER FORM OF BREWING THAT COFFEE EVEN THE TRADITIONAL FRENCH PRESS THE EROPRESS IS EXTREMELY EASY TO USE AND IT'S EXTREMELY COMPACT IN FACT I TAKE IT WITH ME WHENEVER I TRAVEL AND I USE IT ON THE ROAD IN HOTELS EVEN ON PLANS I'LL DISASS FOR SOME HOT WATER IN ALL BREW MY COFFEER TEA RITE THERE ON THE PLAIN WITH OVER FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND FIVE STAR REVIEWS AERO PRESS IS THE BEST REVIEWED COFFEE PRESS IN THE WORLD IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO TRY AERO PRESS YOU CAN GO TO AERO PRESS DOCK CALM

AGAIN THAT'S AEROPRESS DOK COM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET TWENTY PER CENT OFF TO DAY'S EPISODE IS ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY LEVELS LEVELS IS A PROGRAMME THAT LETS YOU SEE HOW DIFFERENT FOODS AND DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES AND YOUR SLEEP PATTERNS IMPACT YOUR HEALTH BY GIVING YOU REAL TIME FEED BACK ON YOUR DIET USING A CONTINUOUS GLUCOS MONITOR NOW BLOOD GLUCOS SOMETIMES REFER TO AS BLOOD SUGAR HAS AN IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM IMPACT ON YOUR ENERGY LEVELS AND YOUR OVERALL HEALTH ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO MAINTAIN FOCUS AND ENERGY THROUGHOUT YOUR DAY AS WELL AS TO KEEP YOUR SO CALLED METABOLIC HEALTH IN BEST ORDER IS TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR BLOOD GLUCOS NEVER SPIKES TOO MUCH NOR DOES IT GET TOO LOW WITH LEVELS YOU CAN MONITOR HOW DIFFERENT FOODS AN FOOD COMMINATIONS IMPACT YOUR BLOOD LUCOS LEVELS ON A MOMENT TO MOMENT BASIS I'VE BEEN USING LEVELS FOR SOME TIME NOW AND IT'S REALLY HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHICH FOODS AND FOOD COMMBINATIONS EXERCISE SCHEDULES AND SLEEP SCHEDULES ARE OPTIMAL FOR MY BLOOD GLUCOS LEVELS AND HOW THAT TRANSLATES TO ENERGY LEVELS AND OTHER METRICS OF HEALTH IF YOUARE INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT LEVELS AND TRYING A CONTINUOUS GLUCOS MONITOR YOU CAN GO TO LEVELS DOT LINK SLASH HUBERMEN LEVELS HAS JUST LAUNCHED A NEW SEGIUM CENSOR THAT IS SMALLER AND HAS EVEN BETTER TRACKING THAN BEFORE RIGHT NOW THEYRE ALSO OFFERING TWO FREE MONTHS OF MEMBERSHIP AGAIN THAT'S LEVELS DOT LINK ALLY AN K SLASH HUBERMEN TO TRY THE NEW CENSOR AND TOO FREE MONTHS OF MEMBERSHIP O KE LET'S TALK ABOUT PLASEBO EFFECTS I WILL ALSO BE TALKING ABOUT NO SEBO EFFECTS AND LET'S JUST ESTABLISH THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE PLUSEBO EFFECTS ARE WHEN AN INERT SUBSTANCE OR BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT THAT IS A SUBSTANCE OR BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY KIND OF DIRECT BIOLOGICAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL ACTIVITY RIGHT IT SHOULDN'T DO ANYTHING ON ITS OWN SOMEHOW DOES IN THE DIRECTION OF IMPROVING SYMPTOMS OR PERFORMANCE NOW LET'S CONTRAST THAT WITH NO SEEBOT NO SEEBOT IS WHEN A DRUG OR BEHAVORAL INTERVENTION WHICH IS INERT IT SHOULD HAVE NO IMPACT ON SYMPTOMS OR PERFORMANCE O ANY KIND BUT WITH NO SIBO IT TURNS OUT THESE SUBSTANCES OR BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS ACTUALLY WORSE AN SYMPTEMS OR PERFORMANCE NOW OFTENTIMES PEOPLE WILL JUST SAY A PLACIBO EFFECT ITS ILA BIT MORE RARE FOR PEOPLE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN PLASIBO AND NO SIBO EFFECTS BUT I DO THING ITS IMPORTANT TO KNOW THEIR DIFFERENCE GOING FORWARD I'LL MOSTLY JUST REFER TO THESE AS PLASIBO AFFACTS BUT I'L TALK ABOUT NO SIBO AFFECTS A LITTLE BIT LATER OW ALSO TALK ABOUT BELIEF EFFECTS SOLISTIOUS ESTABLISH WHAT BELIEF EFFECTS ARE BELIEF EFFECTS ARE WHEN YOU OR SOMEBODY ELSE LEARNS SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE THAT CHANGES YOUR EXPECTATION ABOUT WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN REFERENCE TO SAY STRESS OR CONSUMING A GIVEN FOOD OR TAKING A GIVEN DRUG OR DOING A SPECIFIC BEHAVIORAL PROTOCAL AND THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION YOU LEARN OR ASSIMILATE ACTUALLY LEADS TO THAT SPECIFIC OUTCOME SO IN MANY WAYS BELIEF EFFECTS AND PLACIBO EFFECTS ARE SIMILAR IS JUST THAT THE WORD PLACIBO OR PLACBO EFFECTS AS COMMONLY USED TO REFER TO DRUGS AND BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS BELIEF EFFECTS ARE MORE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE USED TO DESCRIBE WHEN INFORMATION OF ANY KIND CHANGES THE OUTCOME OF SOME PHYSIOLOGICAL OR SYCHOLOGICAL PROCESS NOW WHAT'S COMMON TO PLACIBO NO SEBO AND BELIEF EFFECTS IS THAT THEY ALL WORK BY CHANGING EXPECTATION AND ANY TIME WE TALK ABOUT EXPECTATION WER TALKING ABOUT THE FUNCTION OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND SPECIFICALLY THE BRAIN AND SPECIFICALLY THE PREFRONTAL QUARTACS WITHIN THE BRAIN THE PREFRONTAL QUARTECTS IS NEURAL REAL ESTATE WHICH HAS JUST FANCY NERD SPEAK FOR THE NURONS IN THEIR CONNECTIONS THAT RESIDE JUST BEHIND YOUR FOREHEAD JUST IN THE FRONT OF YOUR SKULL NOW THE PREFRONTAL QUARTECTS HAS A LOT OF DIFFERENT SUBDIVISIONS OR REGIONS THE OVERALL FUNCTION OF THE PREFRONTIAL QUARTECTS CAN BE DESCRIBED AS HAVING THE ABILITY TO EITHER ACTIVATE OR SUPPRESS OTHER NERAL CIRCUITS DEEPER IN THE BRAIN SOME PEOPLE IN FACT OR PREVIOUS GUESSED ON THE HUBERMNLAPATAST A NEUROSURGEON SAID THE PREFRONTIAL QUARTECTS CAN GENERALLY BE DESCRI IBED AS THE STRUCTURE IN THE BRAIN THAT CONTROLS OTHER STRUCTURES IN THE BRAIN BY SAYING S OR SUPPRESSING THEIR FUNCTION SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOU HAVE THE IMPULSE TO MOVE OR TO SHOUT THE PRFRONTIAL QUARTE SUPPRESSES THAT MOVEMENT OR SUPPRESSES THAT DESIRE TO SHOUT OR THAT SHOUTING IF YOU'VEVE EVER HADE THE EXPERIENCE OF YOU KOW GOING TO THE EDGE OF A CLAIFOR BEING ON A HIGH BRIDGE AND THINKING OMAGINISTS LIKE YOU KNOW YOU JUST HAVE THE SPONTANEOUS THOUGHT WHICH PLEASE DON'T DO THIS IN ACTION BUT E ONE WILL HAVE THIS THOUGHT LIKE A MA GOODNIS LIKE WHAT IF I JUST JUMPED OFF AND PEOPLE THINK OMGINIS IU DO I HAVE SOME SORT OF A DEATH WISH WELL NO THE PREFRONTIAL QUARTEX BEING LARGELY A CONTEXT EVALUATING AND PREDICTION MACHINE IS ESSENTIALLY LOOKING AT THAT LANDSCAPE AND PREDICTING WHAT WOULD HAPPEN INDEED HOW BAD IT WOULD BE IF YOU WERE TO JUMP OFF THAT BRIDGE OR JUMP OFF THAT CLIFF AND THEN YOU FEEL THAT OMAGINIS LIKE WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME WHY WOULD I THINK THIS BUT THE FACT THAT YOU THINK IT EVEN FOR A MOMENT BUT YOU DON'T DO IT AND THE FACT THAT YOU RECOGNIZE THAT ITS SORT OF A AH YOU KNOW A DANGEROUS THOUGHT CERTAINLY A DANGEROUS ACTION AGAIN PLEASE DON'T ENGAGE IN THE ACTION TELLS YOU THAT YOUR PREFRONTAL QUARTEX IS WORKING PROPERLY AGAIN THE PREFRONTIAL QUARTAX IS INVOLVED IN SUPPRESSING CERTAIN TYPES OF BEHAVIORS AND WHAT SORTS OF BEHAVIORS WELL THE LARGER THEME OF THE PREFRONTIAL QUARTEX THAT WE NEED CONSIDER TO DAY IS THAT IT IS AN EXPECTATION OR PREDICTION MAKING MACHINE IT IS A BUNCH OF NURONS THAT RELEASE CHEMICALS AND HAVE ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY THAT ARE SPEAKING WITH AN RECEIVING INFORMATION FROM OTHER AREAS OF THE BRAIN AND IT'S A VALUATING A NUMBER OF THINGS LIKE CONTEXT LIK WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS ROOM WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE SCENE WHAT SUPPOSE TO HAPPEN YOUR WHAT MIGHT I DO WHAT SHOULD I DO WHAT SHOULD I NOT DO ET CETERA ET CETERA NOW THE OTHER THING ABOUT THE PREFRONTIAL QUARTEX GIVEN THAT IT HAS ALL THESE DIFFERENT SUBDIVISIONS IS THAT SOME OF THOSE SUBDIVISIONS HAVE A UNIQUEWHAT WE CALL LABELLED LINE COMMUNICATION LIKE A UNIQUE HIGHWAY THAT LEADS TO SPECIFIC BRAIN AREAS THAT CONTROL SPECIFIC BODILY FUNCTIONS INCLUDING HEART RATE BLOOD PRESSURE ET CETERA AND A LITTLE BITE LAT EAR N THE EPISODE I'LL TALK ABOUT A SPECIFIC PAPER SWHEN MY FAVORITE PAPERS IN WHICH A SPECIFIC PREFRONTAL QUARTICAL REGION IS IDENTIFIED AS CONTROLLING VERY PRIMITIVE ASPECTS OF OUR PHYSIOLOGY SUCH AS BODY TEMPERATURE AND HEART RATE IN REFERENCE TO BELIEFS OR WHAT'S HAPPENING IN A SOCIAL SCENE AND THIS IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE WAY THAT SAY GETTING INTO COLD WATER OR EXPERIENCING SOME OTHER SORT OF STRESSOR CAUSES INCREASE IN HEART RAIED OR VASO CONSTRICTION WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PLASIBO NOSIBO AND BELIEF EFFECTS OR THE WAY IN WHICH YOU LEARN INFORMATION OR YOU ARE TOLD INFORMATION LIKE HAY THIS PILL IS GOING TO DO BLANK A MAY BECAUSE THE LABEL SAYS IT MAY BE BECAUSE THE SCIENTIST OR THE DOCTOR TELLS YOU THAT THIS PILL DOES BLANK OR THIS INJECTION WILL DO BLANK OR MAYBE YOU LEARN SOME INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT SOME SPECIFIC DRUG OR SUPPLEMENT OR BEHAVORAL PROTOCOL WILL DO AND IN THAT LEARNING YOU COME TO EXPECT A SPECIFIC SET OF EFFECTS AND CERTAIN NERL CIRCUITS AND THE PREFRONTO CORTECTS BECOME ACTIVE AND START TO ACTIVATE CERTAIN NERL CIRCUITS DEEPER IN THE BRAIN IN AREAS LIKE THE HYPOTHALMUS THESE ARE ANCIENT VERY WELL CONCERVED ACROSS ANIMALS AREAS THE BRAIN THAT CONTROL VERY PRIMITIVE FUNCTIONS Y THEY EXIST IN ESSENTIALLY ALL MAMELS AND EVEN IN REPTILES THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX ALSO COMMUNICATES WITH AREAS OF YOUR BRAINSTEM CONTROLLING THINGS LIKE BREATHING ET CETERA SO THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX IS A SOPHICICATED AREA OF YOUR BRAIN THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT CONTEXT BOTH IN THE PRESENT AS WELL AS MEMORIES FROM THE PAST IT CAN TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION GOALS ABOUT THE FUTURE AND THEN COMBINES ALL OF THAT INTO NERAL SIGNALS TO AREAS OF THE BRAIN THAT CONTROL BASIC PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS RELATE TO THE IMMUNE SYSTEM THE STRESS SYSTEM THE REWARD SYSTEM THE PLEASURE SYSTEM AND ON AND ON SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PLASIBO NOSIBO AND BELIEF EFFECTS WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT IS THE ABILITY FOR INFORMATION AND SPECIFIC EXPERIENCES TO LIED TO EXPECTATIONS WITHIN US ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND THEN OUR PHYSIOLOGY OF OUR BRAIN AND BODY FUNDAME ENTALLY CHANGES SUCH THAT THOSE THINGS HAPPEN SO LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF PLASIBO FFECTS FROM THE RESEARCH LITERATURE AND TO DAY WORK AN A COVER A LOT OF DIFFERENT EXAMPLES FROM DIFFERENT SYSTEMS BUT AS WE DO THAT I WILL SPECIFICALLY BE SELECTING EXAMPLES THAT ILLUSTRATE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PLASIBO EFFECTS AND ILLUSTRATE WHAT THOSE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PLASIBO EFFECTS ARE NOW I SHOULD MENTION THAT IF YOURE INTERESTED IN PLACIBO EFFECTS THERE'S A WONDERFUL BOOK THAT DESCRIBES MANY MANY DIFFERENT PLASIBO EFFECTS AND THEIR BIOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS IN CASES WHERE THOSE BIOLOGICAL UNDERPENNINGS ARE UNDERSTOOD AND THE BOOK O'M REFERRING TO IS ONE THAT I USED PROMINENTLY IN RESEARCHING THIS EPISODE IT'S CALLED NONE OTHER THAN PLACIBO EFFECTS UNDERSTANDING THE OTHER SIDE OF MEDICAL CARE AND THE BOOK IS BY FABRISIO BENEDETI I HOPE I PRONOUNCE THAT RIGT FABRDISIO O ENTOUITALIANS OUT THERE IF I DIDN'T DO IT CORRECTLY I APOLOGIZE IT'S AN ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL BOOK I CONFESS I AVE NEVER MET FABRISIO BENEDETI I CONFESS I HAVE NO RELATION TO THE PUBLISHER OR TO THE BOOK ITSELF EXCEPT THAT I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE BOOK SO HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK I'LL BE PULLING FROM A NUMBER DIFFERENT EXAMPLES DESCRIBED IN THIS BOOK TO DAY TO MY MIND ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING EXAMPLES OF PLASIBO EFFECT IS WHERE PLACIBO IS GIVEN AND CAN PROFOUNDLY CHANGE LEVELS OF DOPOMINE RELEASE IN THE BRAIN NOW THE STUDY I'M ABOUT TO DESCRIBE WAS DONE IN PARKINSON'S PATIENS PEOPLE WITH PARKINSINS HAVE DEGENERATION OF NURONS IN AN AREA OF THE BRAIN CALLED THE SUBSTANTIA NIGRA WHICH IS AN AREA OF THE BRAIN AND THE KIND OF BOTTOM BACK PART OF THE BRAIN FOR YOU IFFACIONATOS AS THE VENTRAL TAGMENTAL AREA BUT YU DON'T EAN TO KNOW THAT NAME THESE NURONS CONTAIN DOPOMINE AND ARE ESSENTIAL FOR THE GENERATION OF SMOOTH MOVEMENT PATTERNS INCLUDING WALKING AND REACHING AND MOVING ON ONE'S HAND TO WRIT ET CETERA AND OF COURSE DOPOMINE AS INVOLVED IN A BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS TOO INCLUDING MOTIVATION AND REWARD IN PEOPLE WITH PARKINSINS DEPENDING ON HOW SEVERE AND ADVANCE THE PARKINSONS IS THEY SUFFER DEFASITS IN THE ABILITY TO GENERATE SMOOTH M MOVEMENTS AND OFTEN DEFASITS IN MOTIVATION AND REWARD PATHWAYS AS WELL NOW THERE MANY DIFFERENT TREATMENTS FOR PARKINSINS SOME MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN OTHERS UNFORTUNATELY STILL NOT COMPLETELY CURABLE AT LEAST NOT AT THIS TIME BUT MOST OF THE DRUGS THAT ARE SUCCESSFUL IN TREATING PARKINSINS TO SOME DEGREE OR IN OTHER ARE DRUGS THAT INCREASED LEVELS OF DOPAMIN WITHIN THE BRAIN FOR OBVIOUS REASONS AS I JUST MENTION PARKINSINS IS A DEGENERATION OF THE DOPAMINERGIC MEANING DOPAMINE CONTAINING AND RELEASING NURONS IN THE BRAIN SO PEOPLE WITH PARKINSINS WILL OFTEN BE GIVEN AL DOPA WHICH AS A PRECURSER TODOPAMINE OR OTHER TYPES OF DRUGS THAT INCREASE DOPAMINE WITHIN THE BRAIN NOW THERE BEEN A NUMBER OF STUDIES THAT HAVE COMPARED CERTAIN DRUGS KNOWN TO INCREASED DOPAMINE SUCH AS AL DOPA THINGS LIKE APOMORPHINE BROM CRIPTINE ET CETERA TO PLACIBO CONTROL DRUGS AND ONE OF THE INTERESTING TAKE AWAYS FROM THOSE STUDIES IS THAT YES DRUGS LIKE AL DOPA BROMACRIPTINE ET CETERA INCREASE DOPAMINE AND AT LEAST CAN PARTIALLY OR TRANSIENTLY IMPROVE SYMPTOMS OF PARKINSINS IN MANY NOT ALL PATIENTS WITH PARKINSINS THE PLACIBO DRUGS GIVEN IN MANY OF THOSE STUDIES WHICH WERE SIMPLY A SUGAR PILL OR SOME OTHER INNERT PILL DOESN'T CONTAIN ANY CHEMICALS THAT ARE KNOWN TO DIRECTLY BIND TO OR INCREASED DOPAMINE IN THE BRAIN AND YET NONE THE LESS WHEN THE BRAINS OF CERTAIN PATIENTS WERE IMAGED IT WAS CLEAR THAT NOT ONLY WAS THERE AN IMPROVEMENT IN SYMDEMOLOGY BUT THERE WERE INCREASES IN DOPAMINE RELEASE WITHIN THOSE PATIENT'S BRAINS WHICH ON THE FACE OF IT SHOULD MAKE NO SENSE HOWEVER WHEN PEOPLE WITH PARKINSINS OR PEOPLE WHO EVEN DONNA PARKINSINS ARE TOLD A GIVEN DRUG CAN INCREASE DOPAMINE AND THEN THEY PUT THESE PEOPLE INTO A BRAIN IMAGING DEVICE IT'S CALLED A PET DEVICE HAS NOTHING D T ANIMALS IS THE POSITRONOMISSION TEMOGRAPHY DEVICE AND THESE PEOPLE HAD BEEN INJECTED WITH OR CONSUMED SOMETHING CALLED RACCLA PRIDE IT SOUNDS RELY WE ARE DINDANGEROUS BUT ACTUALLY RACLA PRIDE LOOKS A LITTLE BIT LIKE DOPAM N ITSELF CHEMICALLY AND HAS A LITTLE TAG OR LABEL ON IT AND IT CAN BIND TO CERTAIN RECEPTORS IN THE BRAIN WHERE DOPAMINE WOULD NORMALLY BIND WHAT WAS OBSERVED IS THAT THE PLUSIBO ITSELF WAS CAUSING REDUCED BINDING OF THIS RACLA PRIDE TO AREAS OF THE BRAIN THAT HAVE DOPAMINE RECEPTORS WHICH MEANT UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT THERE WAS MORE DOPAMINE RELEASED IN THE BRAIN BECAUSE IF MORE DOPAMING IS RELEASED IN THE BRAIN AND PARKS IN THOSE RECEPTORS WILL THEN THE RACLA PRIDE WHICH LOOKS A LOT LIKE DOPAMINE CANT ALSO PARK OR BINE TO THOSE RECEPTORS SIMPLY PUT A PLUSIBO DRUG AGAIN A DRUG THAT HAS NO DIRECT ACTION ON THE DOPAMANERGIC SYSTEM IF IT'S GIVEN TO SOMEBODY WHO HAS PARKINSINS OR WHO DOES IT AND THEY ARE TOLD THIS DRUG IS GOING TO INCREASE LEVELS OF DOPAMINIOR BRAIN AND POTENTIALLY IMPROVE YOUR SYMPTOMS OF PARKINSINS OR HAVE SOME OTHER EFFECT WELL IT SUCCEEDED IN INCREASING DOPAMING LEVELS WITHIN THE BRAIN WHICH BASICALLY SHOULD MAKE US ALL SIT BACK AND SAY OKE WHAT ARE WE TO THINK OF DRUGS LIKE AL DOPA AND A POMORPHINE BROMACRIPTINE AS COMPARED TO PLUSIBO WISEND EVERYONE JUST TAKING PLUSIBO WHYREN'T WE JUST TELLING PEOPLE HAY THIS SUGAR PILL IS GOING TO INCREASE DOPAMINE WHILE TOO IMPORTANT POINTS TO ANSWER THAT FIRST OF ALL THE INCREASES IN DOPAMING THAT ARE OBSERVED FROM PLUSIBO PLUS INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THAT PLUSIBO OUGHT TO DO FOR NCREASING DOPAMINE ARE NOT AS ROBUST RSHOUS THEY GENERALLY NOT AS ROBUST AS THE INCREASES IN DOPAMINE OBSERVED FROM AN ACTUAL DRUG KNOWN TO INCREASE DOPAMINE TRANSMISSION OR RELEASE WITHIN THE BRAIN THE SECOND POINT IS THAT THE STRUCTURE OF THE INFORMATION GIVEN TO SOMEBODY AND THE BELIEF THAT THEY FORM ABOUT WHAT OUGHT TO HAPPEN THAT IS THE EXPECTATION EFFECT WHICH YOU'LL STRUCT TOE REALIZE MORE AND MORE ACROSS TO DAY'S EPISODE THAT EXPECTATION EFFACT REALLY IS THE UNDERPINNING OF THE PLUSIBO EFFECT WHILE THE STRENGTH OF THAT EXPECTATION IS REALLY HARD TO ANCHOR ACROSS INDIVIDUALS AND IN FACT IF PEOPLE REALIZE THEIR TAKING A PLUSIBO THE MAGNITUDE OF THE DOPAMINE INCREASE IS S ACTUALLY DECREASED SO THIS IS WHY WE USE PLASIBO CONTROLS IN CLINICAL TRIALS WE WANT TO ESTABLISH THE REAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE EFFECT OF A GIVEN DRUG ON A BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM IN THIS CASE INCREASING DOPOMIN FROM THE BELIEF OR THE EXPECTATION OF WHAT THAT DRUG WILL DO SO IN THAT SENSE THE PLACIBO IS REALLY A MEASURE OF EXPECTATION OF WHAT A DRUG TREATMENT WILL DO AT LEAST IN THE CONTECTS OF A DRUG TRIAL SO I MENTION THIS SOMEWHAT COMPLICATED EXAMPLE BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL MANY PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN DOPOMIN WE ALL MAKE DOPOMIN ITS INVOLVED IN MOTIVATION DRIVE AND FOCUS AND REWARD ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT THESE DAYS SECOND OF ALL IT REALLY ILLUSTRATES THAT PLASCIBO THAT IS EXPECTATION ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS IMPACTING OF COURSE PLACIBO EFFECTS HE REALIZED THAT NOW BUT IT THEN ALSO HAS TO BE THE CASE THAT PLASIBO EFFECTS ARE PLAYING IN TO ANY EFFECT THAT WE MIGHT OBSERVE FROM TAKING A GIVEN DRUG OR SUPPLEMENT BASED ON OUR EXPECTATION OF WHAT THAT DRUG OR SUPPLEMENT WILL DO AND MIRACULOUSLY OR AT LEAST WHAT I FIND MIRACULOUS IS THAT PLASIBO EFFECTS THESE EXPECTATIONS BASED ON KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEFS ARE HIGHLY SPECIFIC WHICH RAISES ALL SORTS OF QUESTIONS ABOUT FOR INSTANCE IF YOU WERE GIVEN A DRUG THAT INCREASES DOPOMIN LEVELS BUT YOU WEREN'T TOLD THAT IT INCREASES DOPOMI LEVELS THAT PERHAPS YOU WERE TOLD YOU ARE LIED TO AND TOLD THAT IT INCREASES THE ACTIVITY OF A DIFFERENT NARMAGE LATER LIKE CERATONAN WOULD IT WELL LET'S EXPLORE THAT BECAUSE AS WILD AS THAT SEEMS IT TURNS OUT THAT WHAT WE BELIEVE ABOUT A GIVEN DRUG TREATMENT OR BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT ACTUALLY HAS A HIGH DEGREE OF SPECIFICITY SO TO ILLUSTRATE THE INCREDIBLE SPECIFICITY OF PLACIBO EFFECTS I WANT TO DESCRIBE A STUDY RELATED TO HORMON FUNCTION HORMONS COME IN MANY DIFFERENT FORMS WE HAVE TESTASTERON ESTERGEN GROWTHHORMON CORTIS ALL ET CETERA THERE'S A STUDY THAT WAS CARRIED OUT INHUMANS IN WHICH SUBJECTS WERE INFORMED ABOUT GROWTHHORMON RELEASE AND QUARTERS ALL RELEASE GROWTHHORMN IS A HORMON RELEASED FR OM A GLAND IN THE BRAIN CALLED THE PETUITARY THE PETUITARY HAS DIFFERENT PARTS THE ENTER PRETUBITARY RELEASES GROWTH HORMON EACH NIGHT WHEN YOU GO TO SLEEP IT'S INVOLVED IN PROTING SYNTHESIS TISSUE REPAIR BODILY GROWTH APPENDAGE GROWTH AND MANY OTHER THINGS CORTISALL IS A HORMON THAT'S RELEASED FROM THE ADRINALS IT CAN ALSO BE SYNTHASIZED AND RELEASE A COUPLE OTHER PLACES IN THE BRAIN AND BODY AND IT'S INVOLVED IN A MUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION IN ANTEM FLAMMATORY ACTION A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK CORTISALL IS BAD BUT IT'S ACTUALLY AND IMPORTANT HORMON FOR OUR DAILY HEALTH ARE ALERTNESS AND WAKING UP IN THE MORNING ET CETERA IN ANY EVENT SUBJECTS IN THIS STUDY LEARNED ABOUT GROWTH HORMON AND CORTISALL AND THEIRE RELEASE WHERE THEIR RELEASE FROM WHAT THEY DO JUST AS YOU DID AND THEN THEIR GROWTH HORMON AND CORTISAL LEVELS WERE MEASURED AND NOT SURPRISINGLI THEY DIDN'T CHANGE JUST LEARNING ABOUT GROWTH HORMON AND CORTISALL DID NOT CHANGE GROWTH HORMON OR CORTISALL LEVELS IN THESE HUMAN SUBJECTS NOW ON DAYS TWO AND THREE OF THIS EXPERIMENT SUBJECTS RECEIVED AN INJECTION OF A DRUG THE DRUG IS CALLED SUMATRIPTEN AND SUMATRIPTEN IS KNOWN TO INCREASE LEVELS OF GROWTH HORMON AND REDUCE LEVELS OF CORTISALL AND INDEED THAT'S WHAT THEY OBSERVED WHEN PEOPLE RECEIVE THESE INJECTIONS AND THEN THEIR BLOOD WAS DRAWN GROWTH HORMON LEVELS WENT UP CORTIS ALL LEVELS WENT DOWN NOW THE INTERESTING PART OF THE STUDY IS A SEPARATE DAY OCHE SO AFTER THE DRUG TREATMENTS THEY COME BACK AND THEY ARE INJECTED WITH SAILING WHICH HAS KNO SPECIFIC BIOLOGICAL EFFECT IT SIMPLY SALT WATER OQE THEIR INJECTED WITH SAILINE AND THEY EXPERIENCE INCREASES ING GROWTH HORMON AND DECREASES IN CORTISALL WHICH ON THE FACE OF IT MIGHT SEEM LIKE WOW THAT'S INCREDIBLE BUT BASED ON WHAT YOU'VE LEARNED THUS FAR IN TO DAY'S EPISODE YOU COAN IMAGINE THAT KNOWLEDGE ABOUT GROWTH HORMON AND CORTISALL SOMEHOW COMBINED WITH THE INJECTION TO LEAD TO AN EXPECTATION OF INCREASES IN GROWTH HORMON AND DECREASES IN CORTIALL WHICH WOULD BE AMAZING IN ITS OWN RIGHT OCHE AFTER ALL SAILINE IS IN NOURTE IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING DIRECTLY AND SPECIFICALLY TO THE GROWTH HORMON OR CORTISAL SYSTEM BUT GET THIS IT TURNS OUT THAT ASSAILING INJECTION WHICH DOES NOTHING ON ITS OWN ON DAY FOUR OR FIVE AFTER PEOPLE HAVE RECEIVED THIS DRUG TREATMENT INCREASES GROWTH HORMON AND DECREASES CORTISAL INDEPENDENT OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE TOLD THEY ARE BEING INJECTED WITH EVEN IF THEY ARE TOLD THEY ARE BEING INJECTED WITH A DRUG THAT HAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT EFFECTS THAN SUMATRIPTAN SO WHY WOULD THIS BE HOW COULD THIS BE IN FACT THERE WAS EVEN A CONDITION IN WHICH SUBJECTS WERE TOLD ON THE DAY THEY RECEIVE THE PLUCIBO YOU ARE ABOUT TO GET IN INJECTION OF SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO DECREASE GROWTH HORMON BUT RATHER THEY EXPERIENCE A GENUINE INCREASE IN GROWTH HORMON AND DECREASE IN CORTISAL IN THE EXACT SAME WAY THEY DID WHEN THEY RECEIVED THE ACTIVE DRUG SUMA TRIPTAN O CASE SO THIS WILD TYPE OF CENARIO HAS TO BE EXPLAINED AND IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN IT WE NEED TO ZUME OUT FROM THE EXPERIMENT AND ASK WHAT'S THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN DAY TWO AND THREE OF THE EXPERIMENT MEANING THE DAYS IN WHICH THE PEOPLE RECEIVED THE ACTUAL ACTIVE DRUG SUMA TRIPTAN THAT INCREASES GROWTHORMON REDUCES CORTISAL AND THE DAY IN WHICH THEY RECEIVED THE PLACIBO AND THE ONE THING THAT ANCHORS BOTH THOSE DAYS TOGETHER MEANING THE ONE THING IN COMMON THAT CAN EXPLAIN THIS EFFECT IS THAT THOSE WERE THE DAYS IN WHICH PEOPLE RECEIVED AND INJECTION AND IN FACT THROUGH VARIOUS CONTROL EXPERIMENTS AND A FEW OTHER EXPERIMENTS THAT WERE DONE SUBSEQUENT TO THIS AS THIS EXPERIMENT HAS BEEN MORE OR LESS REPEATED IN DIFFERENT FORMS IN DIFFERENT LABORATORIES IT BECAME CLEARER THAT THE BRAIN AND BODY SOMEHOW CAME TO EXPECT THAT RECEIVING AN INJECTION LEADS TO INCREASES IN GROWTH HORMON AND CORTISAL NOW THIS IS NOT AN INDEFINITE AFFACT RIGHT PEOPLE GET INJECTIONS OF OTHER THINGS IN THE FUTURE PRESUMABLY ACTIVE DRUGS NOT JUST SALINE THAT WILL CHANGE HORMON LEVELS OR CHANGE NOR TRANSMITTERLEVELS BUT IN THIS EXPERIMENT WHAT HAPPEN IS IS THAT THERE WAS A PEARING WITHIN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THERE WAS A SOMEHOW A BINDING OF THE NOTION OF GETTING AN INJECTION WITH A SRINGE WHICH IN THE FIRST CASE WAS OF A DRUG THAT INCREASES GROWTHROMAN DECREASES QARTERSALL AND THEN WHEN SUBJECTS CAME BACK AND WERE INJECTED WITH A IFFERENT SRINGE PRESUMABLY I WOULD HOPESO WITH A DIFFERENT SRINGE FILLED WITH SAILING EVEN THOUGH THE SAILING SHOULD DO NOTHING THE BODY AND BRAIN HAD SOMEHOW FORMED APPAIRING AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SRINGE INJECTION AND INCREASED GROWTH HORMONE DECREASED QUARTERSALL WHICH IS INCREDIBLE GIVEN THAT THESE SYSTEMS THE ANTER POTUITARY THE ADRINAL GLANCE IMAN THESE ARE INCIENT SYSTEMS THAT TO OUR KNOWLEDGE WE CAN'T DIRECTLY CONTROL WITH OUR MIND I CAN'T SIMPLY TH T CLOSE MY EYES AND GRIP MY TEETH AND CAUSE THE RELEAE OF GROWTHORMONE I CAN'T SIMPLY DECIDE TO DEPLOY CORTESALL FROM MY ADRINALS ALTHOUGH IF I THOUGHT ABOUT SOMETHING VERY VERY STRUSSFUL FOR A LONG TIME THERE PROBABLY BE SOME QUARTIS AL SECRETION BUT TO OUR KNOWLEDGE THERE IS NO WAY TO USE THOUGHTS TO USE BELIEFS TO USE UNDERSTANDING OF KNOWLEDGE TO CAUSE CHANGES IN OUR INDICRINT GLANCE RIGHT OUR HORMONG LENGTH OF POTUITARY THE ADRINALS BUT HERE WE HAVE A CASE WHERE A DRUG THAT INCREASES CERTAIN HORMONES AND DECREASES OTHER HORMONES SIMPLY BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT THAT IT WAS INJECTED INTO SOMEBODY LEADS TO A CASE WHERE SUBSEQUENT INJECTIONS AT LEAST IN THE SHORT RUN LEAD TO THE EXACT SAME HORMONE CHANGES SIMPLY BECAUSE IN THE MIND AND OR BODY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS INJECTION COMES TO EQUAL INCREASE IN GROWTH HORMON DECREAE IN QUARTES ALL INDEPENDENT OF WHAT'S BEING INJECTED NOW A KEY POINT IS THAT HAD ON THE FINAL DAY OF THE EXPERIMENT THE SUBJECTS BEEN INJECTED WITH A DIFFERENT DRUG THAT FOR INSTANCE YOU KNOW INCREAE OF CERETONE IN OR REDUCES EPINEFRAN I DOUBT THAT THEY WOULD HAVE INSTEAD EXPERIENCE INCREASES IN GROWTH HORMONE AND REDUCTIONS IN QUARTESALL THAT SIMPLY NOT THE CASE THE FACT THAT THERE WAS ONLY SAILING IN THERE MEANT THAT THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE SRINGE AND THE INJECTION WE DON 'T KNOW WHICH TO LEAD TO SOME SORT OF PAIRED ASSOCIATION IN THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT LED TO INCREASE GROWTHHORMON DECREASED CORTIS ALL WHICH MIMIC THE DRUG EFFECT BUT THE WHOLECONAREO HERE AS WILD AS IT IS REALLY SPEAKS TO THE FACT THAT OFTENTIMES WE THINK A GIVEN TREATMENT IS CAUSING AND GIVEN EFFECT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE ACTION OF THE DRUG OR THE ACTION OF A GIVEN BEHAVORAL PROTOCOL BUT IN FACT THE DRUG AND THE PROTOCOL EXIST IN A BIG CONTEXT OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT THE BRAIN AMD BODY ARE INTEGRATING AND TRYN TO MAKE SENSE OF AND THAT OFTEN GETS LUMPED TOGETHER OFTEN SAY THAT YOUR BRAIN IS YES A PREDICTION MACHINE BUT IT'S ALSO TRYING TO SIMPLIFY THINGS IN THOSE PREDICTIONS IS NOT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL THE INFORMATION IT'S OFTEN LUMPING INFORMATION TOGETHER AND COMING UP WITH IDEAS ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND WHY AND DOING THIS SUBCONSCIOUSLY IN A WAY THAT AS YOU JUST LEARN CAN HAVE PROFOUND EFFECTS ON WHAT HAPPENS WITHIN US EVEN AT THE LEVEL OF SOMETHING AS BASIC AS HORNMON RELEASE NOW WHAT I JUST DESCRIBED IS A PRETTY EXTREME EXAMPLE AND IT'S A VERY EXPERIMENTAL CONDITION TYPE EXAMPLE AND IT'S RARE THAT PEOPLE ARE UNDERGOING I YOU KNOW THESE KINDS OF ORGANIZED RECEIVEALL OF INFORMATION AND FOLLOWED BY SPECIFIC DRUG TREETMENTS AND PLUCIBO INJECTIONS ET CETERA BUT YOU'VE ALL EXPERIENCED THE PLACIBO EFFECT IN ACTION BY WAY OF WHAT'S CALLED CLASSICAL CONDITIONING SIMPLY BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT THAT THE SMELLS OF CERTAIN FOODS AND YOUR PAST EXPERIENCE OF CERTAIN FOODS CAN LEAD TO THE RELEASE OF A HORMON CALLED INSOLENT INSOLENT AS A HORMONE THAT IS INVOLVED IN REGULATING BLOOD GLUCOSE BLOOD SUGAR ANTYPICALLY WHEN INSOLENT LEVELS GO UP IN THE BLOODSTREAM GLUCOS LEVELS ARE GOING TO GO DOWN BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE INSOLENT CONTROLS BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS NOW IF YOU'VE EVER HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF WALKING PAST A BAKERY OR EPEATS AF SHOB WHERE A DELICIOUS SMELL IS WAFTING OUT INTO THE ENVIRONMENT YOU MAY NOTICE THAT COTIMAKES YOU HUNGRY AND INDEED IT DOES MAKE YOU HUNGRY BECAUSE PRESUMABLY YOU'VE HADE THE EXPERIENCE OF CERTAIN SMELLS BEING ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONSUMING OF CERTAIN FOODS MAY BE BAKERE FOODS MAY BE PITZA MAY BE STAKE WHATEVER IT IS AND THE CONSUMPTION OF THOSE FOODS ACTUALLY LEADS TO INCREASES IN INSOLENT IN YOUR BLOODSTREAM WELL THERE'S THE SO CALLED CONDITIONING EFFECT WHEREBY THE SMELL OF THE FOOD ITSELF STARTS TO LEAD TO INCREASES IN INSOLENT BUT THE CONDITIONING EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT STIMULE DIFFERENT THINGS IN THE CONTEXT OF EATING AND SPECIFIC FOODS LEADING TO INCREASES AN INSOLENT IS ACTUALLY HIGHLY HIGHLY MODIFIABLE SO MUCH SO THAT EXPERIMENTS HAVE BEEN DONE WHERE FOR INSTANCE SOMEBODY EATS A PARTICULAR FOOD OR IN SOME CASES IS JUST DIRECTLY INJECTED WITH INSOLENT BUT MORE OFTEN CONSUMES A PARTICULAR FOOD AND JUST PRIOR TO CONSUMING OR DURING CONSUMING THAT FOOD THERE'S A BELL RINGING OR A BUZZER IN THE BACKGROUND GOING OFF AND THEY DO THAT A FEW TIMES AND THEN I'M SURE UR ANTICIPATING WHAT'S COMING SOMEBODY CAN JUST HERE THE BUZZER OR THE BELL CAN SIMPLY RING AND THAT PERSON WILL EXPERIENCE AN INCREASE IN INSOLENCE SO WHAT I AM DESCRIBING IS A CONDITIOND INSOLENT RESPONSE A STIMULUS SUCH AS A BELL OR A BUZZER THAT ON ITS OWN SHOULD HAVE ZERO EFFECT ON INSOLENT RELEASE HAS BEEN PARED WITH A FOOD THAT GENUINELY INCREASES INSOLENT WITHIN THE BLOODSTREAM AND THEN EVEN IF THE FOOD IS IN PRESENT THE STIMULUS THE BUZZER THE BELL ET CETERA CAN EVOKE THE INSOLENT RESPONSE OW THIS IS AN IMPORTANT EXAMPLE TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE IT'S A COMMON ONE THAT WE PRSABLY ALL EXPERIENCE AND THAT EXISTS WITHIN THE WIRING OF OUR BRAIN RIGHT NOW BUT ITS DIFFERENT THEN THE SMELL EVOKING THE INSOLENT RESPONSE BECAUSE DELICIOUS FOOD WHICH EVOKES AN INSOLENT RESPONSE HAVING A PARTICULAR ODOR THAT MAKES SENSE IN THE CONTEXT OF FOOD BUT HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING COMPLETELY UNRELATED TO THE FOOD NOT THE ODOR NOT THE TASTE NOT THE APPEARANCE JUST SOMETHING THAT HAPPEN TO BE IN THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH YOU ATE THE FOOD LEADING TO AN INCREASE IN INSOLENT AND IT JUST SCREAMS PLACIBO EFFECT BUT IT ALSO SCREAMS THAT THE PLACIBO EFFECT IS STRONGLY MODIFIABLE ACCORDING TO CONTEXT AGAIN THE PREFONTA QUARTEXT BEING THE SEAT OF THE ANTICIPATION OR PLACIBO EFFECT AND THE PREFUNTO QUARTECTS TAKING I TO ACCOUNT LOTS OF THINGS IN THE ENVIRONMENT TRING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HERE WHAT SOUNDS WHAT SMELLS WHAT COLORS AND THEN LUMPING ALL OF THAT TOGETHER AN EVENTUALLY THROUGH THE ACTIVATION OF SPECIFIC NERAL CIRCUITS LEADING TO A VERY BASIC HORMONO RESPONSE IN THIS CASE THE RELEASE OF INSOLENT AND OF COURSE WHAT I JUST DESCRIBED IS CLASSICAL CONDITIONING ALA PAVLA PAVLAVLON THE NOBO PRIZE FOR HIS DESCRIPTION OF CLASSICAL CONDITIONIN IN WHICH DOGS COULD BE INDUCED TO SALIVATE IN ANTICIPATION OF FOOD BY WAY OF A STIMULUS COMPLETELY UNRELATED TO FOOD ITSELF NOT THE SMELL NOT TO LOOK NOT THE TASTE RATHER JUST A BELL WRUNG BEFORE THE CONSUMPTION OF FOOD IN A DOG EVENTUALLY LED TO A SITUATION WHERE THE MERE RINGING OF A BELL COULD EVOKE SALIVATION FROM THOSE DOGS SO ARE WE ALL JUST LIKE SALIVATING DOGS I GUESS WE ARE I LIKE TO TAKE A BRIEF MOMENT AND THINK ONE OF OUR SPONSORS AND THAT'S A G ONE A G ONE IS A VITEMAN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT ALSO CONTAINS ADAPTAGONS I STARTED TAKING A G ONE WAY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE THE REASON I STARTED TAKING IT IN THE REASON I STILL TAKE IT EVERY DAY IS THAT IT INSURES THAT I MEET ALL OF MY QUOTAS FOR VITEMENS AND MINERALS AND IT INSURES THAT I GET ENOUGH PREBIOTIC AND PROBIOTIC TO SUPPORT GOT HEALTH NOW GOD HEALTH IS SOMETHING THAT OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS WE REALIZED IS NOT JUST IMPORTANT FOR THE HEALTH OF OUR GOD BUT ALSO FOR OUR MUNE SYSTEM AND FOR THE PRODUCTION OF NAURO TRANSMITTERS AND AUROMODULATORS THINGS LIKE DOPAMIN AND CERATONENT IN OTHER WORDS GOD HEALTH IS CRITICAL FOR PROPER BRAIN FUNCTIONING NOW OF COURSE I STRIVE TO CONSUME HEALTHY WHOLE FOODS FOR THE MAJORITY OF MY NUTRITIONAL INTAKE EVERY SINGLE DAY BUT THERE ARE NUMBER OF THINGS IN A G ONE INCLUDING SPECIFIC MICRONUTRIENTS THAT ARE HARD TO GET FROM WHOLE FOODS OR AT LEAST IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES SO A G ONE ALLOWS ME TO GET THE VITEMENS AND MINERALS THAT I NEED PROBIOTICS PREBOTICS THE ADAPTADENS AND CRITICAL MICRONUTRIENTS SO ANY TIME SOMEBODY ASKS ME IF THEY WERE TO TAKE JUST ONE SUPPLEMENT WHAT THAT SUPPLEMENT SHOULD BE I TELL THEM A G ONE BECAUSE A G ONCE U PORT SO MANY DIFFERENT SYSTEMS WITHIN THE BODY THAT ARE INVOLVED IN MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE TO TRY A G ONE GO TO DRINK A G ONE DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMEN AND YOU'LL GET A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMAND THREE K TWO AND FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS OF A G ONE AGAIN THAT TO DRINK A G ONE DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMEN O CASO GIVEN THE CONTEXT IS A POWERFUL MODIFIER OF THE PLACIBO EFFECT AND IN FACT MAY BE CENTRAL TO THE PLASIBO EFFECT I JUST ONE A RATTLE OFF A FEW OF THE KNOWN PLACEBO EFFECTS THAT HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED WOULD SHOW THE EXTENT TO WHICH YOUR BRAIN IN MY BRAIN ARE COMING UP WITH IDEAS ABOUT WHAT GIVEN DRUGS OR GIVEN BEHAVIOURAL TREATMENTS OUGHT TO DO AND IN THAT WAY SHAPING WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU TAKE A PLASIBO OR AND THIS IS AN IDEA THAT WILL GO INTO IN A BIT MORE DETAIL IN A FEW MINUTES PERHAPS CONTECT IS ALSO CHANGING THE WAY THAT ACTIVE DRUGS NOT PLACIBO'S BUT ACTIVE DRUGS ARE IMPACTING YOUR BRAIN AND BODY THE EXAMPLES I'D LIKE TO GIVE OR FROM LABORATORY STUDIES ABOUT THE PLACIBO EFFECT BUT THAT RELATE TO VERY COMMON AT HOME AND NORMAL LIFE CENAREO SUCEITHER YE ARE NOT UNIQUE TO THE LABORATORY AND THEY ARE THE FOLLOWING FIRST OF ALL PLACEBO EFFECTS ARE STRONGLY MODIFIABLE BY THE EXPECTATION OF THE QUALITY OF A GIVEN TREATMENT FOR INSTANCE IF YOU ARE GIVEN A PLAEBO THAT HAS A BRAND NAME ON IT OR A NAME OF A DRUG IT COULD EVEN BE A MADE UP NAME YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE DRUG DOES BUT IT HAS TRADE MARK T M THERE IN THE CORNER OF THE NAME SO BRANNAME AS A POSTED GENERIC PLACIBO THE BRANDNAME PLACEBO HAS A STRONGER EFFECT MOREOVER IF A PLACEBO IS PLACED INTO A PACKAGE NOT JUST PUT IN FRONT OF YOU ON A LITTLE TRAY OR IN A LITTLE DISH BUT RATHER IN A PACKAGE OR YE AE TO PUSH IT THROUGH THAT LOW FOIL RAPPING OR YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT OUT OF A BOTTLE AND ESPESHLY IF THAT RAPPING OR BOTTLE HAS A LABEL ON IT OR IT LOOKS AS IF IT'S A QUOTING QUO REAL DRUG WELL THEN THE PLACIBO HAS AN EVEN GREATER PLASIBO EFFECT THE COLOR OF A GIVEN DRUG CAN EVEN HAVE AN EFFECT BASED ON HOUR ASSOCIATION OR EXPECTATION OF WHAT DIFFERENT COLORS RELATE TO IN TERMS OF OUR PHYSIOLOGY FOR INSTANCE IF SUBJECTS ARE GIVEN PILLS THAT THEY ARE TOLD WILL HELP THEM FALL AND STAY ASLEEP AND SOME SUBJECTS ARE GIVEN BLUE PILLS OTHER SUJECTS ARE IVEN RED PILLS OTHER SUBJECTS ARE IVEN YELLOW PILLS THE SUBJECTS THAT TAKE THE BLUE PILLS TEND TO SLEEP BETTER EVEN THOUGH ALL THE PILLS REGARDLESS OF COLOR ARE PLACIBO THEY CONTAIN NO ACTIVE SUBSTANCE AND SO FOR SOME REASON MOST PEOPLE ASSOCIATE THE COLOR BLUE WITH SLEEP WHEREAS WHERE I SHOULD SAY BY CONTRAST IF PEOPLE ARE GIVEN A BLUE A RED OR A YELLOW PILL AND THEY ARE TOLD ITS A STIMULANT THE SUBJECTS TAKING THE RED PILL HERE I MEAN THE ACTUAL LITERAL RED PILL AR NOT TALKING ABOUT ANY KIND OF CULTURAL RED PILL HAVEN'T SEEN THE MATRICS YET PEOPLE TOMII NUN TO SEE IT BUT NON TIM ABOUT TAKING THE RED PILL QUOTE ON QUOTE ON TALKING ABOUT TAKING A PILL THAT IS THE COLOR RED IN AN EXPERIMENT THE PEOPLE THAT TAKE THAT PILL EXPERIENCE A GREATER PLESIBO INDUCED STIMULAN TO FECT AS OPPOSED TO WHEN SUBJECTS TAKE A BLUE OR A YELLOW PILL FOR SOME REASON THE COLOR RED IS ASSOCIATED WITH A QUOTENQUOTE UPPER A FACT OR STIMULANT EFFACT MOREOVER IF SUBJECTS ARE GIVEN A BLUE A RED OR A YELLOW PILL AND THEY ARE TOLD THAT THE PILL WILL HAVE AN ANTI DE PRESS INT OFFACT THE SUBJECTS THAT TOOK THE YELLOW PLACIBO YET THE BIGGEST ANTI DEPRESSENT EFFACTS SO COLOR OF A GIVEN PILL EVEN IMPACTS THE DIRECTION OR IN THIS CASE THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PLACIBO OFFACT AND I SHALD MENTION THEN EVERY ONE OF THOSE STUDIES YES THERE WAS INFORMATION ABOUT T WHAT THE GIVEN PILL SHOULD DO IT WAS NOT THE CASE THAT IF PEOPLE TOOK THE RED PILL THEY FELT A STIMULANT O FACT IF THEY TOOK A BLUE PILL THEY FELL TO SLEEPY A FACT AND IF THEY TOOK THE YELLOW PIL THEY FILL AND ANTI TA PRESSENT EFFCT THESE WERE THREE SEPARATE EXPERIMENTS ONE ON SLEEP WHERE SUBJECTS WERE GIVEN ONE OF THE THREE COLORS OF PILLS BLUE HAVE THE STRONGEST EFFECT OR A TUDY OF STIMULANT EFFACTS THEY WERE TOLD ITS A STUDY A PILLS THAT WILL INCREASE ALERTNESS AND ATTENTION THEY WERE GIVEN ONE OF THREE DIFEREN COLORS THE RED PILLS AT THE BIGGEST EFFECT AND THE THIRD EXPERIMENT SUBJECTS WERE TOLD THIS IS A PILL THAT WILL ALLEVIATE TO SOME DEGREE YOUR SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION THE PEOPLE WHOT TOOK THE YELLOW PILL EXPERIENCE THE GREATEST RELIEF OF DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS NOW THAT'S PRETTY WILD BUT BUT PERHAPS AS EVEN WILDER IS THE MORE INVASIVE O PLACIBO INTERVENTION IS THE GREATER THE PLACIBO EFFECT SO CAPSULS HAVE A BIGGER EFFECT THAN TABLETS I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S MORE INVASIVE BUT I GESS IT LOOKS MORE MEDICINAL TO HAVE A CABSOL VERSE IS A TABLET WHO KNOWS WHY BUT THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN OBSERVED AND INJECTION OF A PLACIBO HAS A GREATER EFFECT THAN A CONSUMPTION OF A CAPSUL OR A TABLET OF COURSE AND IF PEOPLE ARE PLACED INTO A MEDICAL DEVICE OR MACHINE ESPECIALLYIN CASES WHERE ONE OF THEIR LIMBS OR BOTH OF THEIR LIMBS OR EVEN THEIR WHOLE BODY IS PLACED INTO A DEVICE EVEN THOUGH THE DEVICE IS DOING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING SPECIFICALLY TO OUR BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM IT IS INERT RIGHT A BUNCH OF BUTTONS AND A BUNCH OF NOISES AND A MUCH OF HUMMING AS IF SOMETHING WERE HAPPENING BUT NOTHING IS TAPENING THAT DIRECTLY RELATES TO ANY ONE SPECIFIC BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM EXCEPT AND NOW YOU KNOW WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY EXCEPT EXPECTATION OF WHAT THE MACHINE IS DOING WHILE THAT HAS THE GREATEST PLACIBO EFFECT OF ALL SO FOR SOME REASON AS THE LEVEL OF INVASIVENESS OR THE LUCH A SAY THE COMPLEXITY OF A GIVEN TREATMENT IS INCREASED WILL THEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PLACIBO EFFECT IS ALSO INCREASED AND WHAT THIS TELLS US IS THAT THE HUMAN BRAIN HAS COME TO ASSOCIATE LEVEL OF INVASIVENESS LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY OF A GIVEN TREATMENT OR MACHINE TO EQUATE TO BIGGER OUTCOMES AND IN SOME SENSE THAT'S COMPLETELY LOGICAL BUT AGAIN WE HAVE TO REMEMBER IN ABSOLUTELY ZERO OF THESE CONDITIONS WHETHER NOT'S A TAB LIT A CAPSIL AND INJECTION OR A MEDICAL DEVICE IS THERE ANYTHING BEING DONE TO THESE HUMAN SUBJECTS THAT IMPACTS OF SPECIFIC BIOLOGICAL FUNCTION EXCEPT ONE AND THAT ONE AGAIN IS THE ACTIVATION OF SPECIFIC NERAL CIRCUITS IND THE PREFUNTAL QUARTEXTS THAT THEN ARE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH OTHER AREAS OF THE BRAIN AND BODY THROUGH BONIFIED BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS OF NERO TRANSMITTER RELEASE AND ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY IN NURANCES WHAT THE BRAIN DOES AN OF COURSE THE PRIFON THE QUARTECS BEING PAR THE BRAIN THOSE ARE THE MECHANISMS IS EMPLOYS TO CHANGE THE ACTIVITY OF HORMON RELEASING GLANCE TO CHANGE THE ACTIVITY OF OTHER NURONS IN OTHER WORDS THE BELIEF EFFECTS THE EXPECTATIONS ARE REAL THEY ARE HAVING EFFECTS THROUGH TRUE BIOLOGICAL CIRCUITRY ISJUST THAT THE PILLS AND THE TREATMENTS AND THE MACHINES ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING SPECIFIC AT ALL EXCEPT ACTIVATING EXPECTATION SO WEAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE PLACIBO EFFECT AND I'VE BEEN GIVING EXAMPLES OF STRONG PLASIBO EFFECTS AND WHILE ALL OF WHAT I TOLD YOU IS SUBSTANTIATED BY DATA I DO NOT ONE TO GIVE YOU THE IMPRESSION THAT THE PLASIBO EFFECT IS LIMITLESS BECAUSE IT IS NOT LIMITLESS FOR INSTANCE PLASIBOS HAVE BEEN USED TO HELP IN THE TREATMENT OF CANCER BUT THEIRE EFFECTS WITHIN THE TREATMENT OF CANCER ARE LIMITED TO A VERY SPECIFIC SET OF SYMPTOMS AND CONTEXTS SO FOR INSTANCE PEOPLE WHO ARE TOLD A GIVEN DRUG WILL HELP THEM WITH THEIR CANCER BY REDUCING THEIR SYMPTOMS OF KIMOTHERAPY OR RADIATION THERAPY OFTEN EXPERIENCE REDUCTIONS IN THE NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS OF KIMOTHERAPE OR RADIATION THERAPY REDUCED PAIN REDUCED NAGIA AND BY CONSEQUENCE IMPROVED FEELINGS OF WELL BEING COMPARED TO PEOPLE WHO DO NOT RECEIVE THE PLASIBO AND WHO ARE NOT TOLD HEY THIS DRUG WHICH IN REALITIES OF PLASIBO IS GOING TO HELP YOU WITH YOUR TREATMENT ITS GOING TO MAKE IT LESS UNCOMFORTABLE OCASO IN THE CONTECTS OF CANCER TREATMENT PLASIBO CAN REDUCE THE DISCOMFORT OF VARIOUS CANCER TREATMENTS HOWEVER PLASIBOS CANNOT REDUC S THE SIZE OR ELIMINATE TUMORS IF PEOPLE WHO UNFORTUNATELY HAVE TUMORS C CANCER ARE GIVEN A PLACIBO AND TOLD THIS DRUG WHICH ACTUALLY AS A PLACIBO UNBENOTES TO THEM IS GOING TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF YOUR TUMORS OR ELIMINATE YOUR TUMORS THAT PLACIBO IS NOT EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THE SIZE OR ELIMINATING THOSE TUMORS THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND BECAUSE AS YOU RECALL PLACIBO EFFECTS ARE EXPECTATION EFFECTS EXPECTATION EFFECTS ARE DRIVEN IN LARGE PART BY THE PREFRONTAL QUARTECTS IN ITS CONECTIVITY TO OTHER AREAS OF THE BRAIN AND THEREBY TO THE BODY BUT THE OUTPUTS OF THE PREFRONTAL QUARTECS ARE LIMITED THERE ARE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THEM AND INDEED THERE ARE MANY OF THEM BUT THOSE CONNECTIONS DO NOT EXTEND TO TUMORS THEMSELVES OR BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OR CIRCUITRIES THAT ALLOW ONE'S BELIEFS TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF OR ELIMINATE TUMORS AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE MANY SUFFERERS OF CANCER AND THERE ARE MANY THEORIES ABOUT ACCELERATING THE TREATMENT OF OR IMPROVING THE TREATMENT OF OR EVEN CURING CANCER USING SO CALLED MINE BODY TECHNIQUES HER MINE BODY TOOLS AND WE NEED TO BE FAIR TO THE DATA WHICH HAVE CONCLUSIVELY SHOWN THAT REDUCTIONS AND STRAS IMPROVEMENTS AND SLEEP SOCIAL SUPPORT A NUMBER OF THINGS CAN IMPROVE CANCER TREATMENT OUTCOMES NOW THOSE ARE NOT PLACIBO EFFECTS THOSE ARE ALL PRACTICES FOR WHICH WE KNOW THERE ARE REDUCTIONS IN INFLAMMATION REDUCTIONS IN STRESS HORMONS THAT LEAD TO IMPROVED OUTCOMES IN THE CONTECT OF RADIATIONTHERAPY IN THE CONTECT OF A MUNOTHERAPE IN THE CONTECT OF ANY BONIFIED TREATMENTS KNOWN TO REDUCE TUMOR SIZE SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS SEPARATE OUT THREE THINGS HERE BEHAVIORAL PRACTICES SUCH AS MEDITATION SLEEP SOCIAL SUPPORT KNOWN TO REDUCE IMFLAMMATION AND STRESS AND THAT CAN IMPROVE CANCER OUTCOMES THOSE ARE NOT PLACIBO EFFECTS THOSE ARE REAL EFFECTS THERE ARE ALSO DRUGS RE DIATION CIMOTHERAPE AMUNOTHERAPE AND DEVICES KNOWN TO REDUCE TUMORSIZE AND HOPEFULLY ELIMINATE CANCEROS TUMORS THAT WOULD BE THE HOPE THOSE ARE REAL EFFECTS AND THEN THERE ARE THE PLUSIBO EFFECTS THE KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEF AND EXPECTATION ABOUT WHAT A GIVEN TREATMENT WILL DO IN SOME CASES ITS KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHAT A GIVEN DRUG WILL DO THAT IMPROVES THE OUTCOME ACHIEVED WITH THAT DRUG IN SOME CASES ITS PEOPLE BEING GIVEN A COMPLETELY INERT SUBSTANCE OR SOLUTION LIKE SELIAN SOLUTION BUT BEING TOLD THIS IS GOING TO HELP WITH YOUR NAUSIO SYMPTOMS THIS IS GOING TO HELP WITH YOUR PAIN DURING YOUR MUNOTHERAPY RADIATION ET CETERA AND THOSE ARE REAL EFFECTS BUT THEY CAN ONLY BE EXPLAINED BY VIRTUE OF EXPECTATION AND KNOWLEDGE ACH A A PLASIBO EFFECTS AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THOSE PLASIBO EFFACTS ARE NOT ACTING DIRECTLY ON TUMORS TO REDUCE THEIR SIZE OR ELIMINATE THEM ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW PLAUSIBO EFFECTS CAN BE VERY POWERFUL AND YET STILL HAVE LIMITS TO THEM IS YET ANOTHER STUDY FROM DOCTRI TED CAPTRUC SLAB AT HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL AND BY THE WAY MANY NOT ALL OF THE STUDIES THAT IAVE BEEN DESCRIBING TO DAY HAVE BEEN DONE BY THE CAPTRI LAB HE'S DONE BEAUTIFUL WORK ON PLAUSIBO EFFACTS FOR A VERY LONG TIME NOW HE'S CONSIDERED A REAL PIONEER AND A LEADER IN THE STUDY OF PLASIBO AND HEHAS ALSO BEEN A BIG PROPONENT OF EXPLORING THE PLASIBO EFFECT NOT SIMPLY AS A CONTRAST TO DRUG EFFECTS OR DEVICE EFFECTS BUT AS THEIR OWN SPECIFIC EFFECT THAT PERHAPS CAN BE LEVERAGE IN THE CONTACTS OF TREATING DISEASE SO HATS OFF LITERALLY PLUREL HATS OFF BECAUSE THEY'VE HAD OWE SO MANY DISCOVERIES IN THE CONTACTS OF PLUSIBO AND THEIR POWERFUL EFFECTS AN THEIR POSSIBLE USES FROM THE CAPTU CLAB AND THEIR COLLEGUES THERE AT HARVARDMEDICAL SCHOOL JUST INCREDIBLE WORK AND ONE OF MY FAVORITE STUDIES FROM THE CAPTRIC LAB IS ONE PUBLISHD IN THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL MEDICINE SOME YEARS AGO IN WHICH THEY TOOK PEOPLE WHO HAD ASHMA SO THESE ARE PEOPLE DIAGNOSED WITH ASM THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE CHALLENGES BREATHING AND THEY EXPERIENCE A LOT OF DISCOMFORT IN TRYING TO BREATHE NORMALLY UNLESS THEY ARE TAKING THEIR ASTHMA MEDICATION IN THIS STUDY THEY TOOK PEOPLE OFF OF THEIR ASTHMA MEDICATION OF COURSE NOT INDEFINITELY BUT FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND AS EXPECTED THOSE PEOPLE EXPERIENCED CHALLENGES IN BREATHING AND DISCOMFORT ASSOCIATE WITH THE CHALLENGES IN BREATHING ONE GROUP RECEIVED NO TREATMENT THEY WARE JUST TAKEN OFF THEIR ASHMAMEDS AND EVALUATED AND THEN OF COURSE PUT BACK ON THEIR ASTHMAMETS ANOTHER GROUP RECEIVED A PLASIBO TREATMENT AND ANOTHER GROUP RECEIVED A DRUG KNOWN TO IMPROVE THE SYMPTOMS OF ASTHMA NOW WHAT WAS INTERESTING IS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE THE DRUG FOR THE TREATMENT OF ASTHMA NOT SURPRISINGLY HAD IMPROVEMENTS IN BREATHING AND LESS DISCOMFORT EXACTLY WHAT YOU'D EXPECT HOWEVER THE PEOPLE WITH PLASIBO ALSO EXPERIENCE LESS DISCOMFORT IN BREATHING BUT THEIR PATTERNS OF BREATHING DIDN'T CHANGE SO AGAIN THIS REALLY SPEAKS TO THE FACT THAT PLASIBO EFFECTS CAN BE VERY POWERFUL BUT THAT THEIR VERY SPECIFIC THEY ARE NOT SIMPLY WIPING OUT A CONDITION LIKE ASTHMA OR COMPLETELY ELIMINATING ALL SYMPTOMOLOGY OF A GIVEN CONDITION LIKE CANCER THIS STUDY ILLUSTRATES VERY CLEARLY THAT PLASIBO IS EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THE DISCOMFORT ASSOCIATED WITH THE CHALLENGES OF BREATHING BUT NOT ELIMINATING CHALLENGES WITH BREATHING PERSEY WHEREAS SHEY MENTUNE BEFORE THERE ARE DRUGS BONIFIED PRESCRIPTION DRUG TREATMENTS THAT CAN BOTH RESTORE NORMAL PATTERNS OF BREATHING AN RELIEVE THE DISCOMFORT SO WHAT THIS REALLY SPEAKS TO IS THE FACT THAT THE PREFRONTIAL QUARTECS AND ITS INVOLVEMENT AND EXPECTATION CAN HAVE POWERFUL EFFECTS ON THINGS LIKE PAIN POWERFUL EFFECTS ON THINGS LIKE DOP AMEIN POWERFUL EFFECTS ON ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT BRAIN AND BODY SYSTEMS BUT NOT ALL OF THEM OUR BELIEFS AND EXPECTATIONS ARE POWERFUL AS EVIDENCED BY THE PLASIBO EFFECT ITSELF BUT THEY ARE NOT WHAT WE CALL OMNIPOTENT THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING ID LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BRAK AND THANK OUR SPONSOR INSIDE TRACKER INSIDE TRACKER IS A PERSONALIZED NUTRITIAN PLATFORM THAT ANALYZES DATA FROM YOUR BLOOD ENDIANE TO HELP YOU BETTER UNDERSTAND YOUR BODY AND HELP YOU REACH YOUR HEALTH COALS I'VE LONG BEEN A BELIEVER IN GETTING REGULAR BLOOD WORK DONE FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT MANY OF THE FACTORS THAT IMPACT OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM HEALTH CAN ONLY BE ANALYZED FROM A QUALITY BLOOD TEST A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH A LOT OF BLOOD TESTS OUT THERE HOWEVER IS THAT YOU GET INFORMATION BACK ABOUT METABOLIC FACTORS LIPIDS AND HORMONES AND SO FORTH BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THAT INFORMATION WITH INSIDE TRACKER THEY MAKE IT VERY EASY BCAUSE THEY HAVE A PERSONALIZED PLATFORM THAT ALLOWS YOU TO SEE THE LEVELS OF ALL THOSE THINGS METABOLIC FACTORS LIPIDS HORMONES ET CETERA BUT IT GIVES YOU SPECIFIC DIRECTIVES THAT YOU CAN FOLLOW THAT RELATE TO NUTRITIAN BEHAVIORAL MODIFICATION SUPPLEMENTS ET CETERA THAT CAN HELP YOU BRING THOSE NUMBERS INTO THE RANGES THAT ARE OPTIMAL FOR YOU IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY INSIDE TRACTOR YOU CAN GO TO INSIDE TRACKER DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMAN TO GET TWENTY PER CENT OFF ANY OF INSIDE TRACTRS PLANS AGAIN THAT'S INSIDE TRACKER DOT CAM SLASH HUBERMEN ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITE STUDIES IN THE CONTECT OF PLECIBO IS A PAPER THOTAS PUBLISHED PRETTY RECENTLY AND THE TITLE OF THIS PAPER IS NICOTINE RELATED BELIEFS INDUCE DOSE DEPENDENT RESPONSES IN THE HUMAN BRAIN AND IF EVER THERE WAS A PAPER THAT POINTED TO THE FACT THAT OUR BELIEF SYSTEMS CAN REALLY SHAPE THE WAY THAT DIFFERENT DRUGS DIFFERENT SUPPLEMENTS DIFFERENT BEHAVORAL PROTOCALS CAN IMPACT THE WAY THAT ARE PHYSIOLOGY AND OUR BRAIN WORK IT'S THIS PAPER IT'S A PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD STUDY IT WAS OF COURSE CARRIED OUT INHUMANS AND WHAT THEY DID IS THEY HAD PEOPLE VAPE NICOTINE NICOTINE IS A KNOWN COGNIVE AND HANCER NICOTINE SO NAMED BECAUSE IT BINDS TO NICOTEN ACACITAL CULLING RECEPTORS IN THE BRAIN WHICH IS JUST FANCY NURD SPEAK FOR THE RECEPTORS THE LOPARKING SPOTS FOR A SITAL COALING A NUROMODULATOR THAT'S INVOLVED IN ATTENTION AND BY VIRTUE OF BEING INVOLVED IN ATTENTION IS RITICAL FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF CERTAIN FOCUSSED TASKS SO MOST PEOPLE ASSOCIATE NICOTIN WITH SMOKING VAPING DIPPING OR SNUFFING HERE WERE TALKING ABOUT NICOTINE NETS OF VAPED HOWEVER I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR I AM NOT ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO VAPE NICOTINE YES VAPING IS PROBABLY HEALTHIER FOR YOU THAN SMOKING BUT VAPING IS NOT GOOD FOR YOU IT WOULD BE BETTER TO NOT VAPE THAN TO VAPE AT ALL I DIDN'T ENTIRE EPISODE ABOUT NICOTINE SO I WANT TO LEAVE ASIDE THE ISSUE OF WHETHER NOT YOU DECIDE TO USE NICOTINE A THAT'S ALL COVERED IN THE EPISODE ON NICOTINE ON PROVIDED LINK TO THAT THE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS IS A LOT OF CONSIDERATIONS THERE IT DOES INCREASE BLOOD PRESSURE N IT CREASES VASO CONSTRICTION NON ANDON BUT AS I MENTION NICOTINE IS A COGNIVE AND HANCER IT CAN INCREASE FOCUS AN ATTENTION END IN DOING SO IT CAN ALLOW YOUR BRAIN TO DO CERTAIN THINGS BETTER LIKE TASKS WITCHING LIKE FOCUSING IN THE CONTECTS OF A LOT OF DISTRACTION ET CETERA ET CETERA SO IN THIS STUDY NIOTINE RELATED BELIEFS IN DUCED TOST TUPENNENT RESPONSES IN THE HUMAN BRAIN SUBJECTS USED AVAPE TO IN JEST NICOTINE AND THEY WERE TOLD THAT THEY WERE EITHER INJESTING A LOW MEDIUM OR HIGH CONCENTRATION OF NICOTINE AND I REALLY NICE THING ABOUT THE STUDY IS THAT THEY ACTUALLY MEASURED HOW MUCH NICCOTINE PEOPLE VAPED SOI THEY WERE ABLE TO MEASURE HOW MUCH NICOTINE MADE INTO THE BLOOD STREAMS OF THESE PEOPLE AND THEY WERE ALSO ABLE TO AVALUEATE BRAIN ACTIVITY IN AREAS OF THE BRAIN KNOWN TO HAVE THESE NICOTINIC RECEPTERS AND TO ALSO BE INVOLVED IN CERTAIN COGNAVE TASKS SO JUST TO GET TO THE GRAND CONCLUSION OF THE STUDY WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE TOLD THAT THEY INJESTED A HIGH CONCENTRATION OR A MEDIUM CONCENTRATION OF NICOTINE PERFORMED BETTER ON A COGNVE TASKS THAT WE KNOW IS DEPENDENT ON OR CAN BE MODIFIED BY THE AMOUNT OF A SEEDOCOLLING TRANSMISSION IN A CERTAIN ARYA OF THE BRAIN THEN DID INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE TOLD THAT THEY INJESTED A SMALL CONCENTRATION OF NICOTINE NOW THE INTERESTING PART OF THE STUDY IS THAT EVERYBODY C ONSUMED THE SAME AMOUNT OF NICOTINE SO HERE WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THERE IS A SO CALLED DOSE DEPENDENT PLECIBO EFFECT EVERYONE GETS THE SAME AMOUNT OF NICOTINE BUT PEOPLE ARE EITHER TOLD MEANING THEY WERE LIED TO IN SOME CASES THAT THEY GOT A SMALL MEDIUM OR HIGH CONCENTRATION OF NICOTINE AND FOR THE GROUP THAT WAS TOLD THAT THEY RECEIVED A MEDIM CONCENTRATION O NICOTINE THEY PERFORMED BETTER ON A COGNIVE TASK THEN DID THE PEOPLE WHO WERE TOLD THEY RECEIVED A SMALLER CONCENTRATION OF NICOTINE MOREOVER PEOPLE WHO WERE TOLD THAT THEY RECEIVED A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF NICOTINE PERFORMED BETTER THAN EITHER THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE TOLD THEY RECEIVED A MEDIUM OR SMALL CONCENTRATION OF NICOTINE BUT AS I MENTION BEFORE EVERYONE RECEIVED THE SAME CONCENTRATION OF NICOTINE SO THIS TELLS US THAT NOT ONLY ARE PLACIBO EFFECTS RELATED TO EXPECTATION BUT THAT THE EXPECTATION SOMEBODY HAS OF THE DEGREE OF AN EFFECT THETION EXPERIENCE ACTUALLY CREATES A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF EXPERIENCE PUT DIFFERENTLY IF YOURE TOLD THAT YOUR GETTING A SMALL AMOUNT OF DRUG A MEDIUM AMOUNT OF DRUG OR HIGH AMOUNT OF DRUG AND THAT THE SIZE OF AN EFFECT GETS BIGGER AS YOU GO FROM SMALL MEDIUM TO HIH WELL THAN YOU WILL EXPERIENCE THE SMALL MEDIUM OR HIGH EFFECT DEPENDING ON WHICH GROUP YOU WERE IN EVEN IF YOU ALL GOT THE SAME DOSE OF DRUG NOW I NEED TO BE VERY CLEAR EVERYBODY GOT ACTUAL NICOTINE THE PLACIBO EFFECT HERE IS RELATED TO WHAT PEOPLE BELIEVED ABOUT THE DOSE OF NICOTINE THEY GOT BUT EVERYONE GOT ACTIVE NICOTINE NOW HERE'S WHERE IT GETS REALLY COOL AS I MENTION EARLY OR IN THIS STUDY THEY IMAGED THE BRAINS OF PEOPLE THAT WERE INEITHER THE GROUP THAT WAS TOLD THEY GOT A SMALL OR MEDIUM OR HIGH CONCENTRATION OF NICOTINE AND WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT IN THE SPECIFIC AREA OF THE BRAIN THAT IS KNOWN TO RESPOND I NICOTINE AND THAT IS INVOLVED IN COGNIE FUNCTIONING RELATED TO THE TASK THAT THESE SUBJECTS WERE GIVEN THEY SAW INCREASED LEVELS OF ACTIVITY OF THE NURONS IN THAT BR AIN REGION THAT SCALED UP ACCORDING TO WHETHER NOT PEOPLE WERE TOLD THEY GOT A SMALL MEDIUM OR HIGH AMOUNT OF NICOTINE AGAIN EVERY ONE GOT THE SAME AMOUNT OF NICOTINE THEY WERE SIMPLY TOLD SMALL MEDIUM OR HIGH AND THE BRAIN AREA ITSELF CHANGED ITS LEVEL OF ACTIVITY WHICH IN TURN CHANGED THE OUTCOME ON THE COGNIVE TASK WHICH BASICALLY PUTS EVERYTHING IN A REALLY NICE BOX WRAPS IT UP WITH WRAPPING PAPER BEAUTIFULLY PUTS IT IN A BOW AND SAYS O KE PLASEBO EFFECTS ARE REAL AND PLASIBO EFFECTS SCALE WITH THE DEGREE OF EXPECTATION THAT ONE HAS SO ANY TIME WE ARE TOLD THAT A SMALL DOSE OF SOMETHING IS GOING TO LEAD TO A SMALL EFFECT A MEDIUM DOSE OF SOMETHING IS GOING TO LEAD TO A BIGGER EFFECT AND A HIGDOSE WILL LEAD TO AN EVEN HIGHER EFFECT WELL WHETHER NOT THAT OCCURS IS GOING TO DEPEND A LOT ON WHAT SORTS OF COTENCOTE EFFECTS WE ARE EXPECTING AGAIN YOU CAN'T USE PLASEBO TO ELIMINATE TUMORS THERE IS A LIMIT TO WHAT PLASEBO EFFECTS CAN OCCUR BUT ASSUMING THAT THE EFFECT THAT ONE IS INTERESTED IN IS MODIFIABLE BY KNOWLEDGE AND EXPECTATION WELL THE SIZE OF THAT EFFECT WILL SCALE WITH HOW BIG YOU EXPECT THE EFFECT TO BE AND IT'S NOT PURELY PSYCHOLOGICAL THAT'S THE POINT HERE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT YOUR BELIEFS AND YOU DOING SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT IN THE CONTECT OF A TASK OR IN A SPORTS EVENT YOUR PHYSIOLOGY IN THIS CASE THE ACTIVITY OF A SPECIFIC BRAIN REGION INCREASES ITS LEVEL OF OUTPUT ACCORDING TO YOUR EXPECTATION OF THE LEVEL OF DRUG YOU CONSUMED SO IN MY DESCRIPTION OF THAT RECENTLY PUBLISHED STUDY YOU NOTICE I SAID PLASEBO EFFECTS BUT IN MANY WAYS WHAT I WAS DESCRIBING WORT BELIEF EFFECTS IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT TO DISENTANGLE WHAT'S A PLASEBO EFFECT IN WHAT'S A BELIEF EFFECT IN GENERAL BELIEF EFFECTS HAVE TO DO WITH ACCUIRING A BIT MORE INFORMATION OR SPECIFICITY OF INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THE EXPECTATION SHOULD BE SO I SUPPOSE THE STUDY I JUST DESCRIBED COULD EASILY FALL UNDER THE CATEGORY OF BELIEF EFFECTS AND NOT JUST PLASEBO EFFECTS BUT NONE THE LESS BELIEF EFFECTS ARE POWERFUL AND THEIR SPECIALLY POWERFUL BECAUSE AS ONE STARTS TO LAY ER IN DIFFERENT AMOUNTS IN DIFFERENT TYPES OF INFORMATION AS TO WHAT HAD GIVEN DRUG TREATMENT OR BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT WILL DO ONE CAN START TO SEE REALLY NEUANTSD OUTCOMES AS WELL AS TRULY SURPRISING OUTCOMES AND SOME OF MY FAVORITE STUDIES ON BELIEF EFFECTS WERE DONE BY MY COLLEAGUE AT STAMFORD SHE'S IN THE DEPARTMENT A PSYCHOLOGY HER NAME IS DOCTOR A LEACRUM SHE'S BEEN A GUEST ON THE HUBERMAN LABPODCAST BEFORE WE WILL ALSO PROVIDE A LINK TO THAT EPISODE AND ALLEY'S LAB STUDIES MINE SETS MINE SETS OF COURSE IN CORPORATE A LOT OF THINGS BESIDES BELIEFS THEY INVOLVE PRIOR KNOWLEDGE THEY AND TO HAVE EVEN MORE INFORMATION WOVEN INTO THEM THAN EITHER PLOCIBO EFFECTS OR BELIEF EFFECTS BUT ALLEY'S REALLY ONE OF THE WORLD LEADERS IN UNDERSTANDING THESE BELIEF EFFECTS AND HAS DONE SOME JUST GORGEOUS WORK IN ILLUSTRATING THE INCREDIBLE RANGE AND EXTENT OF BELIEF EFFECTS THAT EXIST ONE OF MY FAVORITE STUDIES IN THIS CONTACT IS THE PAPER FROM ALLEY'S LAB ENTITLED MIND OVER MILKSHAKES MINE SETS NOT JOUS NEUTRIANTS DETERMINE THE GRELLIN RESPONSE SO HERE I'LL JUST BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THE STUDY ALL PARAPHRASE THE ABSTRACT ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS PEOPLE CONSUMED A THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY CALORY MILKSHAKE AND THEY WERE EITHER TOLD THAT IT WAS A SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY CALORY QUONINQ INDULGENT SHAKE OR A ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY CALORY QUUINQUO SENSIBLE SHAE THEN THE HORMON GRELLIN WAS MEASURED GRELLIN IS A HORMON ASSOCIATED WITH HUNGER IT IS RELEASED FROM AND BINDS TO VARIOUS SIGHTS WITHIN THE BRAIN AND BODY BUT IT'S GENERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE HUNGER RESPONSE THE DESIRE FOR FOOD THEN THEIR SUBJECTS HAD THEIR BLOOD DRAWN AT THREE DIFFERENT TIME POINTS SO AT BASE LINE PRIOR TO CONSUMPTION OF THE MILKSHAKE ANTISIPATORY MEANING JUST PRIOR TO CONSUMING THE MILKSHAKE AND POST CONSUMPTION NINETY MINUTES AFTER CONSUMING THE MILKSHAKE AND THEN GRELLIN WAS MEASURED WITHIN THE BLOOD SAMPLES THAT THE PEOPLE PROVIDED NOW AS YOU RECALL EV ERYONE IS CONSUMING THE SAME THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY CALORY SHAKE BUT THAT'S UNBEKNOWNCE TO THEM ONE GROUP THINKS THEIR DRINKING AN INDULGENT SHAKE THAT HAS LOST HE CALORIES THE OTHER GROUP THINKS THEIR INJESTING A COTIN SENSIBLE SHAKE WITH FEWER CALORIES AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT IN THE STUDY THE INDIVIDUALS WERE ASKED TO READ THE LABELS OF THE SHAKAN GET INFORMATION ABOUT OKAY THIS IS AN INDULGENT SHAKE HAS A LOT OF CALORIES LOT OF FAT ET CETERA IN THE OTHER CASE THIS SHAKE HAS VERY FEW CALORES IT CONTAINS HEALTHY INGREDIENTS ET CETERA NOW YOU CAN PROBABLY GUESS WHERE THIS IS GOING THE PEOPLE THAT CONSUMED THE MILKSHAK BUT WERE TOLD IT WAS A HIGH CALORY INDULGENT SHAKE AND ALSO BY THE WAY CONSUMED INFORMATION ABOUT IT BEING HIGH CALORY AN INDULGEN ARE THEIR READING THAT ON THE LABEL EXPERIENCED STEEPER REDUCTIONS IN THIS HUNGER ASSOCIATED HORMONE CALLED GRELIN AS COMPARED TO THE GROUP THAT ALSO CONSUMED THE SAME THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY CALORY SHAKE BUT THOUGHT THAT THE SHAKE WAS A SENSIBLE SHAKE WITH FEWER CALORIES THAT WAS A HEALTHIER SHAKE THOSE PEOPLE EXPERIENCE REDUCTIONS IN GRELLAND AS WELL BUT THEY WERE LESS STEEP THEY OCCURRED LESS QUICKLY OVER TIME AND IN ADDITION THEIR SUBJECTIVE LEVEL OF SATIETY OF FULNESS OR OF FEELING AS IF THEY HAD ENOUGH FOOD TO QUELL OFF HUNGER WAS ALSO RELATED TO WHETHER R NOT THEY THOUGHT THEY D CONSUMED THE HIGHER CALORY INDULGENT SHAKE OR THE LOWER CALORY SENSIBLE SHAE THERE ARE BUNCH OF OTHER INTERESTING ASPECTS TO THIS STUDY I AM JUST GIVING YOU A CURSORY OVER VIEW OF THE MAJOR EFFECTS BUT THE TAKE AWAY IS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD WHAT WE BELIEVE ABOUT THE FOODS WE ARE CONSUMING STRONGLY IMPACTS THE DOWNSTREAM HORMONAL EFFECTS OF CONSUMING THOSE FOODS GRELLAN AFTER ALL IS A PEPTIE HORMONE THAT IS SECRETED FROM THE STOMACH  YES THE STOMACH HAS NURONS BUT AS FAR AS WE KNOW THE STOMACH DOES N'T HAVE A LITTLE THINKING BRAIN IN THERE THE STOMACH IS OPERATING IN A VERY KIND OF CRUDE LANGUAGE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AS COMPARED TO THE THINKING IN A ANALYTIC LANGUAGE OF THE BRAIN THE FOREBRAIN BUT WHAT 'S HAPPENING HERE IS THAT KNOWLEDGE INDEED SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHAT MORE CALORIES MEANS AS SOPPOSED A FEWER CALLERIES WHAT THE WORD INDULGENT MEANS AS OPPOSED TO SENSIBLE ALL OF THAT IS BEING COMBINED AND THEN COMMUNICATING WITH NURONS AND OTHER SYSTEMS OF THE GUT TO LITERALLY CREATE A DIFFERENT HORMONAL RESPONSE TO FOOD AND THAT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE THE HORMONAL RESPONSE TO FOOD IS A VERY STRONGLY EVOLUTIONARY CONCERVED SET OF MECHANISMS AND YET THIS STUDY AND OTHER STUDIES LIKE IT INCLUDING THE CONDITIOND INSOLENT RESPONSE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER YOU PAVLOV'S DOGS ARE IN THIS CASE WE ARE THE PAVLOV'S DOGS WHERE THE ONES THAT CONGET CONDITION TO A BELL OR THE SMELL OF A FOOD OR THE SIHT OF A SIGN ON A BAKERY TO GET A INSOLENT INCREASE ALL OF THAT STUFF THAT IS PRIMITIVE HARD WIRING OF THE BRAIN EMBODY IS ALSO BEING STRONGLY IMPACTED BY THE MORE LET'S CALL IT SOPHISTICATED OR ANALITIC ASPECTS OF THE WIRING OF THEBRAINS SUCH AS THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX SUCH THAT WHAT WE BELIEVE IS GOING TO HAPPEN IS ACTUALLY WHAT HAPPENS NOW THE OTHER STUDY ON BELIEF EFFECTS AND MIND SETS AND HOW THEY CAN IMPACT OUTCOMES IN TERMS OF OUR PHYSIOLOGY RELATES TO EXERCISE AND THIS IS A STUDY ON THAT DOCTOR CRUM HERSELF DESCRIBE HIM ABOUT BECAUSE SHE WAS TALKING TO ONE OF HER ACADEMIC ADVISERS THIS WAS BEFORE SHE OPENED HER OWN LABORATORY AND YO ALEAS AN ATHLETE SHE WAS ACTUALY A DIVISION ONE ATHLECH IS INCREDIBLY IMPRESSIVE INDIVIDUAL BY THE WAY SHIS A TENOR PROFESSOR AT STAMFORD AS SHE WAS A DIVISION ONE ATHLETE SHAS A DEGREE OR RATHER A CERTIFICATION IN CLENICAL PSYCHOLOGY SO AM SHE'S EXTREMELY ACCOMPLISHED INDIVIDUAL BUT EXERCISE AN ATHLETICS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A BIG PART OF HER LIFE AND ONE DAY SHE WAS TALKING TO HER ADVISER AND HER ADVISER OFFERED THE POSSIBILITY THAT AND HERE IM PARAPHRASING FROM A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION PERHAPS ALL THE POUSIVE EFFECTS OF EXERCISE ARE PLESIBO THAT'S I SHLLY WHAT HER ADVISER SAID AND ALLES AT NO THERE'S N N AWAY RIGHT AND WE KNOW THAT YOU EXERCISE YOU SURE GETTING INCREASE IN HEARTRAHT IN BLOOD PRESSURE DURING EXERCISE BUT THAT LEADS TO LOWER LEVELS OF BASELINE BLOOD PRESSURE AND HART RATE AFTERWARDS AFTER YOU ADAPTE THAT EXERCISE AND HER ADVISER SAID WELL CAY THAT MIGHT BE TRUE BUT WHY DON'T YOU GOTEST IT SO SHE DID TEST IT WHAT SHE DID IS SHE TOOK HOTEL SERVICE WORKER SO THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT CLEAN HOTEL ROOMS FOR A LIVING AND THESE ARE VERY ACTIVE PEOPLE RIGHT THEIR VACUMING THEIR CHANGING SHEETS ERE GOING UPSTAIRS THER FOLDING LAUNDRY THERE DOING A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT THINGS THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND THEY DIVIDED THEM INTO TWO GROUPS ONE GROUP WAS TOLD THAT DOING A GREAT JOB AND BEING DILIGENT IS VERY GOOD FOR YOU THEY WERE TOLD ALL SORTS OF THINGS ABOUT THEIR JOB AND HOW IT WAS IMPORTANT AND INDEED THEIR JOB IS IMPORTANT RIGHT WE NEED PEOPLE WHO CAN PERFORM THESE ROLLS OF TURNING OVER HOTEL ROOMS AND DOING THOSE SORTS OF THINGS SO THAT HOTEL ROOMS CAN BE CLEAN AND BEAUTIFUL WHEN WE ARRIVE THE OTHER GROUP HOWEVER WAS TOLD THAT THE NORMAL DAILY ACTIVITIES THAT THESE PEOPLE WERE PARTAKING IN THE FOLDING OF THE LAUNDRY GOING UP AND DOWN THE STAIRS PUSHING OF CARTS ET CETERA WAS EXERCISE AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THAT IT WAS THE TYPE OF MOVEMENT THAT COULD FOR INSTANCE LEAD TO REDUCTIONS IN BLOOD PRESSURE REDUCTIONS IN BODY WEIGHT IMPROVEMENTS IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT HEALTH METRICS NOW THE INCREDIBLE OUTCOME OF THIS STUDY WAS THAT SIMPLY ON THE BASIS OF WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE WERE TOLD AND THEREFORE BELIEVED THAT THEIR DAILY ACTIVITIES WOULD LEAD TO IMPROVEMENTS IN THESE DIFFERENT HEALTH METRICS PREDUCTIONS AND BLOOD PRESSURE REDUCTIONS AND BASIL HEART RATE REDUCTIONS IN BODY WEIGHT WELL THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED PEOPLE WHO RECEIVED THE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW EXERCISE WAS HEALTHY AND THEIR WORK MIMICED EXERCISE EXPERIENCED THE HEALTH METRIC CHANGES WHEREAS PEOPLE WHO WERE SIMPLY TOLD YOUR WORK IS IMPORTANT YOU W IT'S IMPORTANT TO DO A GOOD JOB ET CETERA ET CETERA THEY DID NOT EXPERIENCE THE SAME HEALTH METRIC IMPROVEMENTS SO THAT PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR WHAT DOCTOR CRUMS ADVISER HAD SUGGESTED THAT AT LEAST SOME OF THE EFFECTS OF EXERCISE ARE LIKELY DUE TO MIND SETS OR BELIEFS ACH A A BELIEF EFFECTS SO THROUGHOUT TO DAY'S EPISODE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HOW OUR EXPECTATIONS AND BELIEFS AND MIND SETS CAN IMPACT IS REALLY DEEP LAYERS OF OUR PHYSIOLOGY THINGS LIKE HORMON RELIESE THINGS LIKE LEVEL OF DISCOMFORT OR PAIN DURING A GIVEN TREATMENT AND ON AND ON AND I'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE PREFRNTAL QUARTEX AS CRITICAL FOR UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S HAPPENING IN AE GIVEN CONTEXT AND FORESETTING THOSE EXPECTATIONS BECAUSE THE PREFRONTAL UARTEX AS YOU RECALL IS A PREDICTION MACHINE AND CONTEXIS IMPORTANT FOR PREDICTION AND ON AND ON WHAT I HAVEN'T YET TOLD YOU IS HOW IT IS THAT THE REFRONTAL QUARTEX ACTUALLY DOES THIS I MEAN WHAT ARE THESE MAGICAL OUTPUT PATHWAYS OF THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX AND WHILE I ALREADY ESTABLISHED THAT THEY ARE NOT INFINITE RIHTE THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX CAN'T CONTROL EVERYTHING MEANING IF I  GIVE YOU SOME INFORMATION LIKE YOU KNOW JUST THINKING ABOUT AN BELIEVING THAT ON YOUR LEFT QUADRUCEP IS GOING TO BE YOU KNOW MUCH STRONGER THAN YOUR RIGHT QUADRUCEP AND IF YOU JUST KEEP PERSEVARATING ON MEANING YOU KEEP THINKING ABOUT THAT AND LOOPING ON IN YOUR MIND AND I GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW YOU THINKING ABOUT STRENGTH CAN MAKE MUSCLE STRONGER AND ON AND ON YOU KNOW IN THE CLASSIC CONTEXT OF THE POSIBO EFFEXT ALL THAT EXPECTATION OUGHT TO LEAD TO AN IMPROVEMENT IN STRENGTH AND PRAPSIZE OF YOUR LEFT QUADRUCEP BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENS WHY OR MORE ACCURATELY WHY NOT WELL AS FAR AS WE KNOW THERE ISN'T A DIRECT NERL CIRCUIT OR HORMONAL PATHWAY WHEREBY THOUGHTS FROM THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX CAN IMPACT THE GROWTH OF MUSCLES IN YOUR LEFT QUADRUCEP HOWEVER THERE ARE OUTPUT PATHWAYS FROM THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX TO REGIONS OF THE BRAIN THAT ARE KNOWN TO CONTROL VERY BASIC BODILY AN BRAIN FUNCTIONS SUCH AS THE HYPE OF PHALAMUS AND THOSE PATHWAYS ARE KNOWN TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE CERTAIN PERAMETERS OF OUR FOR INSTANCE STRESS RESPONSE SO BLOOD PRESSURE HEARTRATE VAZO CONSTRICTION EVEN BODY TEMPERATURE SO I T JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT AND DESCRIBE WHAT I CONSIDER ONE OF THE MORE BEAUTIFUL STUDIES ILLUSTRATING A SPECIFIC PATHWAY FROM THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX TO THE HYPOTHALEMUS THAT A LOUS CONTROL OF THE SO CALLED STRESS RESPONSE IN THE CONTEXT OF VERY SPECIFIC PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESSERS NOW THIS PAPER IS IMPORTNOCIOUS FOR OUR DESCUSSION OF POCIBO BELIEF IN MINE SET EFFECTS BUT ALSO FOR ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT SO CALLED PSYCHOSEMATIC EFFECTS OR THE IDEA THAT ARE MODES OF THINKING WHETHER R NOT THEY ARE RELATED TO CALMNESS OR DISTRESS CAN STRONGLY IMPACT ARE PHYSICAL HEALTH AND THE TITLE OF THE PAPER IS A CENTRAL MASTER DRIVER OF PSYCHO SOCIAL STRESS RESPONSES IN THE RAT GOODNESS THAT'S A TONGUE TWISTER PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESS RESPONSES IN THE RAT NOW THE FACT THAT THIS STUDY WAS PERFORMED IN THE RAT SHOULD NOT CAUSE US TO LEAN AWAY FROM IT OR TO THINK THAT IT'S NOT RELEVANT TO HUMANS BECAUSE THE VERY SAME CIRCUITRIES THAT ARE DESCRIBED WITHIN THIS STUDY HAVE ANALOGOUS CIRCUITRIES WITHIN THE HUMAN BRAIN I KNOW THAT TO BE TRUE FROM MY WORK IN NORANATOMY TEACHING NORANATOMY AND OTHER GROUPS SEPARATE FROM THE GROUP THAT DID THIS STUDY HAVE EXPLORED SIMILAR CIRCUITRIES IN THE HUMAN BRAIN NOW IN THIS STUDY WHAT THEY WERE ABLE TO DO WAS TO IDENTIFY THESE TWO PARTICULAR REGIONS WHICH I'LL JUST CALL THEM D P D T T FOR SHORT SO INSTEAD OF SAYING DORSA PODUNCULAR QUARTEX AND DORSALTO NEATECTA SO JUST SAY D P D T T THIS IS THES AREA OF THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX OCE DON'T LET THESE ACRANYMS AND NAME SCARE YOU THESE ARE JUST NAMES OF A LITTLE SUBREGION WITHIN THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX SEND CONNECTIONS LITTLE WIRES THAT WE CALL AXONS TO A AREA OF THE BRAIN CALLED THE DORSOMEDIAL HYPOTHALEMUS THE DORSOMEDIA HYPOTHALEMUS IS A HIGHLY CONCERVE STRUCTURE MEANING WHETHER NOT YOU LOOK IN MOUSE OR IN RAT OR IN APES OR IN HUMANS OR IN DOGS THE DORSOMEDIA HYPOTHALEMUS CONTAINS NURANS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN GENERATING CARDINAL FEATURES OF THE STRESS RESPONSE THINGS LIKE INCREASED BLOOD PRESSURE THINGS LIKE INCREASED VASO CONSTRICTION THINGS LIKE INCREASED BODY TEMPERATURE THINGS LIKE INCREASED BROWN FAT THERMOGENESIS NOW WE CAN EVEN GO A STEP FURTHER BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY DID IN THE STUDY THEY MAPPED THE CONNECTIONS FROM THESE SPECIFIC SUBREGIONS OF THE PREFRONTA QUARTEX THE D P D T T DOWN TO THE DORSOMEDIOHYPOTHALEMUS AND A VERY SPECIFIC SET OF NERANS WITHIN THE DORSIMEDIO HYPOTHALEMUS BUT EVEN THERE WE'RE STILL IN THE BRAIN WE HAVEN'T YET ESTABLISHED HOW ACTIVATION OF THE SPECIFIC NURANS IN THE DORSOMEDIOHYPOTHALMUS ACTUALLY CHANGE BLOOD PRESSURE HOW THEY ACTUALLY CAUSE VAZO CONSTRICTION IN THE PRIFHRY CAUSE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET VERY STRESSED WHETHER NOTS FROM SOCIAL STRATS OR FROM COLD WATER THERE IS A CONSTRICTION WE CALL VESO CONSTRICTION IN THE PERIFERY MY BLOOD IS SHUTTLED TOWARD THE COARD THE BODY TO KEEP YOUR CORORGANS ALIVE YOUR STILL GOING TO GET BLOOD TO THE BIG LIMBS OF YOUR BODY SO YOU CAN MOVE RUN IF YOU NEED TO BUT YOUR DIGITS HOURE APPENDAGES ARE GOING TO GET FAR LESS BLOOD FLOWED TO THEM BECAUSE OF THIS PASEAL CONSTRICTION AND THAT'S ACHIEVED BY AN OUTPUT FROM THE DOORSOMEDIO HYPOTHALEMUS O CASE OF THE SECOND HUB ALONG THIS CHAIN TO AN AREA OF THE BRAINSTEM CALLED THE ROSTRIL MEDULARY RAFE OCKE AGAIN FANCY NAME YOU DON'T HAFE TER REREMEMBER THE NAME IF YOU DON'T WANT TO MAYBE YOU IFFACIONATOS WANT TO BUT WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IS WE'RE MOVING FROM THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX TO THE HYPOTHALMUS THEN TO THE BRAINSTEM AND THEN FROM THE BRAINSTEM OUT TO WHAT WE CALL THE PARIFHRY TO THE BODY TO THE SPINAL CORD TO THE BLOOD VESSELS THEMSELVES TO THE ORGANS OF THE BODY LIKE THE GUT AND THE HEART AND THE LUNGS ALL THE THINGS THAT WE ASSOCIATE WITH THE SO CALLED STRESS RESPONSE SO AS WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT PLACIBO EFFECTS AND BELIEF EFFECTS AND MIND SET EFFECTS AND LEARNING THAT OCA JUST OUR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT SOMETHING OUR ANTICIPATION OUR THINKING CAN INFLUENCE LEVELS OF A HUNGER HORMON ISN'T THAT WILD OR CAN INFLUENCE THE AMOUNT OF PAIN THAT WE EXPERIENCE IN RESPONSE TO A CANCER TREATMEN OR CAN CHANGE THE AMOUNT OF DOPEMING IN THE BRAIN IN THE CONTE OF A PLACIBO GIVEN TO PEOPLE WITH PARKANSIN S WELL ALL OF THAT SEEMS VERY VERY SURPRISING UNTIL YOU LOOK AT STUDIES OF THE SORT THAT HAVE BEEN DESCRIBING IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES THAT ARE STARTING TO ESTABLISH THE VERY PRECISE NERAL CIRCUITRIES THAT LEAD FROM AREAS OF THE BRAIN LIKE THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEXS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THOUGHT AND CONTECT AND PLANING AND PREDICTION DOWN TO I DON'T WANT TO CALL THEM THE DEEPER OR MORE PRIMITIVE LAYERS OF THE BRAIN BECAUSE THESE AREAS LIKE THE HYPOTHALMAS AND THE MADOLA THE BRAINSTEM TTHEUGH NOT REALLY PRIMITIVE IN THE SENSE THAT THEY DO VERY SOPHISTICATED THINGS IS JUST THAT THEY TEND TO BE PRESENT IN BOTH MAMMELS AND REPTILES THEIR PRESENT IN FISH WHEREAS THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX IS A BRAIN STRUCTURE THAT HAS UNDERGONE FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT ELABORATION AS YOU MOVE FROM ANIMALS LIKE SAY CATS DOGS UP TO GREAT APES AND TO HUMANS AND AT LEAST TO OUR KNOWLEDGE AS A FIELD OF NEROSCIENTISTS AND BIOLOGISTS HUMANS HAVE THE MOST SOPHISTICATED OR RATHER ELABORATE PREFRONTAL QUARTEXS THE MOST NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SUBAREAS OF THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEX AND EVERY TIME THERE'S AN INVESTIGATION OF THOSE SUBAREAS WHAT THEY DO WHAT THEIR ANATOMIES ARE MEANING WHERE THEY CONNECT TO AND WHO CONNECTS BACT TO THEM IT'S FOUND THAT THERE IS A TREMENDOUS DEGREE OF SPECIFICITY ALL OF WHICH IS TO SAY THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED AT ALL THAT THESE PLACIBO BELIEF AND MIND SAT EFFECTS OCCUR BECAUSE THERE'S A CLEAR BIOLOGICAL SUBSTRATE FOR THEM SO UP UNTIL NOW WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE PLASIBO OFFACT AS THESE INCREDIBLE SET OF EFFECTS THAT HAVE A REAL BIOLOGICAL SUBSTRATE THERE ARE ANATOMICAL PATHWAYS HORMONAL PATHWAYS NRO TRANSMITTERS INVOLVED AND THAT'S ALL TRUE BUT WHAT'S ALSO TRUE IS THAT THE PLOSIBO EFFECT CAN VERY IN SIZE TREMENDOUSLY BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS END ACROSS DIFFERENT STUDIES AND IN FACT THIS WAS DESCRIBED IN THE FIRST FORMAL STUDY OF THE PLUSIBO EFFECT IN THAT STUDY IT WAS SHOWN THAT PPROXIMATELY THIRTY PER CENT OF THE INDIVIDUALS IN THE STUDY SHOWED A ROB UST PLUSEBO EFFECT BUT THAT THE OTHER SEVENTY PER CENT SHOWED A LESS ROBUS PLUSIBO EFFECT AND THAT RESULT MEANING THAT VARIATION IN SUSCEPTIBILITY TO THE PLUSEBO EFFECT HAS BORNE OUT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN ACROSS DIFFERENT STUDIES NOW MODERN SCIENCE HAS NOW TAUGHT US THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE GENOMES THE GENES THAT HAPPEN TO BE EXPRESSED IN ONE INDIVIDUAL VERSES THE NEXT VERSES THE NEXT VERSES THE NET THERE ARE ARE CERTAIN GENES NOT A LOT OF THEM BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN GENES THAT SEEM TO CORRELATE WITH CERTAIN TYPES OF PLUSEBO EFFECT BEING GREATER OR LESSER IN CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS AND WHILE THERE ARE LOT OF THESE DIFFERENT GENES AND A LOT OF DIFFEREN PLUSEBO EFFECTS ONE OF THE MORE INTERESTING ONES IS THE CI O M T GENE WHICH IN CODES FOR SOMETHING CALLED CATACOL O METHEL TRANSFRASE CATACOL O METHEL TRANSPRACE AS THE NAME SUGGESTAS IT HAS A ASE IN THEIR IN THE CONTACTS OF A DISCUSSION ABOUT BIOLOGY THAT ALMOST ALWAYS MEANS YOUR TALKING ABOUT IN ENZIM CATACOL O METHEL TRANSPHRACES IN ENZIM INVOLVED IN THE REGULATION OF THE SO CALL CATACOLAMINES CATACOL MEANS BEING DOPOMINE EPINEPRAN AND NOREPINEFERAN OCAN EHAVE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT DOPOMINE IN THE CONTACTS OF PARKINSINS I'VE TALKED ABOUT DOPEMING A LOT FRANKLY ON THE HUBERMAN LALPOTCAST BECAUSE IT'S INVOLVED IN MOTIVATION IT'S INVOLVED IN FOCUS PURSUIT OF REWARD IT'S INVOLVED IN MOVEMENT AS WE DISCUSSED EARLIER NOR EPINEPERAN ANEPINEPRAN ALSO DO MANY DFFERENT THINGS IN THE BRAIN INBODY BUT NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS TO INCREASE ACTIVATION STATE FOR HEIGHTEN FOCUS FOR INCREASING THE BIAS TOWARD MOVEMENT OF THE BODY AND ON AND ON IN ANY EVENT THIS GENE SEO M T CATACOL O METHEL TRANSPHRACE SEEMS TO SHOW STRONG VARIATION IN INDIVIDUALS THAT SHOW STRONG VARIATION IN HE PLUSEBO RESPONSE TO CERTAIN TYPES OF PLUSEBO CONDITIONS AND I JUST MENTION IT BECAUSE A I THINK IT'S SUPERINTERESTING AFTER ALL A LOT OF THE STUDIES THAT HAVE DEMONSTRATE PLUSEBO EFFACTS HAVE SHOWN THOSE EFFECTS IN THE CONTACTS OF CHANGES IN DOPOMINE EPINEPERON AND NOR EPINEPERON SO IT'S NOT WITHOUT CONTEXTS THAT WERE TALKING BY THESION TEGENE BUT ALSO JUST AS A GENERAL THEME THE FACT THAT THERE ARE GENES THAT IN COD FOR SPECIFIC BIOLOGICAL SUBSTRATES IN THIS CASE REGULATION OF DOPENING EPINEPERON AND NOR EPINEFERON AND THOSE GENES SHOW UP AT DIFFERENT LEVELS IN DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS AND THE PLACEBO EFFECTS SHOW UP A DIFFERENT LEVELS IN DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS AND NOW THERE ARE STUDIES THERE ARE STARTING TO SHOW THAT THE LEVELS OF THOSE GENES AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH ONE EXPERIENCES THE PLASEBO EFFECT EITHER ELEVATED RESPONSE OR REDUCE RESPONSE TO THE PLASIBO EFFECT SEEM TO BE FAIRLY STRONGLY CORRELATED SO THIS AGAIN IS MORE EVIDENCE THAT YES THE PLACEBO EFFECT IS BASED ON KNOWLEDGE BELIEF EXPECTATION BUT THAT IT HAS A REAL BIOLOGICAL SUBSTRATE JUST AS THERE ARE ANATOMICAL PATHWAYS OUT OF THE PREFRONTAL QUARTEXTS OF THE HYPOTHALEMAS DOWN TO THE BRAINSTEM AND OUT TO THE BODY THERE ARE ALSO GENES EXPRESSED IN SPEACIFIC CELLS WITHIN OUR BRAIN AND BODY THAT ALLOW FOR OUR BELIEFS AND EXPECTATIONS THAT ARE CARRIED THROUGH THAT PREFRONTAL QUARTECTS CIRCUITRY TO HAVE EITHER A GREATER OR LESSER EFFECT SO THROUGHOUT TO DAYS EPISODE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HOW KNOWLEDGE YOUR BELIEF AN UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN OUGHT TO HAPPEN OR VERY LIKELY WILL HAPPEN INFLUENCES WHETHER NOT THAT THING ACTUALLY HAPPENS THE SOCULPLASEBO EFFECTOR BELIEF AF FECT OR MIND SET AFFECT AND WHAT I HOPE I'VE MADE CLEAR DURING THE COURSE OF OUR DISCUSSION IS THAT WHILE PLACEBO EFFECTS ARRIVE THROUGH OUR COGNATIVE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT MIGHT OUGHT TO OR IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN THE DOWNSTREME EFFECTS THE EFFECTS ON ASMA IRRITABLE BAWELCYNDRUM INSOLENT GROWTH HORMON YOU KNOW PICTURE FAVORITE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM ESSENTIALLY EVERY SYSTEM WITHIN THE BRAIN AND BODY HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO PLACBO FFECTS WHAT I HOPE IS BECOMING CLEAR IS THAT IN EVERY CASE THE PLACEBO EFFECT IS A BIOLOGICAL EFFECT IT'S NOT JUST YOU KNOW OUR THOUGHTS TRICKING US INTO THINKING SOMETHING HAPPENED THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN IT'S OUR THOUGHTS OUR MIND CREATING

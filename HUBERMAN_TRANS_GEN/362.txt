UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY AND THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN AT MADICINE ROBERT GREEN'S BOOKS ARE BOTH UNIQUE AND IMPORTANT FOR SEVERAL REASONS NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS THAT THEY EXPLORE THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SELF SELF EXPLORATION AND THE PSYCHOLOGY OF HUMAN INTERACTION ALL ROOTED IN HISTORY AND MODERN CULTURE AND AT THE SAME TIME IN A WAY THAT PURTAINS TO EVERYBODY I FIRST LEARNED ABOUT ROBERT'S WORK FROM READING THE BOOK MASTERY WHICH TO MY MIND IS A BRILLIANT EXPLORATION AND A PRACTICAL TOOL FOR HOW TO THINK ABOUT AND PURSUE ONE'S PURPOSE WHENEVER OUT MASS FOR

DURATIONS AND THAT HAD A LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF MEDITATIONS TO PLACE THE BRAIN ADBODY INTO DIFFERENT STATES AND THAT HE LIKED IT VERY MUCH SO I GAVE THE WAKING UP AP PATRY AND I TOO FOUND IT TO BE

TEACHING A COURSE TO UNDERGRADUATES THIS WAS A BIG COURSE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY STUDENTS AS TE THIS WAS WHENE I WAS A PROFESSOR AT UNIVERSILY CALIFORNIA SANDIEGO WAS ABOUT TO MOVE BACK TO STAMFORD AM BUT THE COURSE WAS ENTITLED NAURAL CIRCUITS IN HEALTH AND DISEASE BUT THERE WAS A FINAL LECTURE WHERE I WOULD DO A LOT OF CUANE WITH THE STUDENTS ABOUT SCIENCE ABOUT CAREERS ABOUT CAREER PATHS AND WHAT I FOUND WAS THAT MANY OF THE STUDENTS HAD QUESTIONS ABOUT NOT JUST SCIENCE BUT ABOUT HOW TO LEARN AND FORAGE FOR INFORMATION AND I RECOMMENDED THREE BOOKS AT THE END OF THE COURSE EVERY YEAR THAT I TAUGHT IT I TAUGHT IT FOR FOUR YEARS AND ONE OF THE BOOKS WAS THE BOOK LONGITUDE WHICH IS A WONDERFUL STORY ABOUT DISCOVERY OF TIME KEEPING DEVICEIS AT SEE AM ONE BOOK I'LL LEAVE AS A MYSTERY  NOT TO BE NOT TO BE MYSTERIOUS BUT BECAUSE O IT IT'S A SCIENCE BOOK I'LL JUST TELL YOU WHAT IT IS ITS AM A PRINCIPLES OF NARRAL SCIENCE SO I THOUGHT I DON'T KNOW THAT YET A  ITS  IT MAKES A BETTER A DOOR STOP A FOR MOST THAN THAN A BOOK BUT IT IT'S A WONDERFUL RESOURCE AM IF YOU WANT TO LEARN ABOUT NAROLSCIENCE AND YOUR BOOK MASTERY  AND THE REASON I RECOMMENDED MASTERY IS BECAUSE THESE STUDENTS WERE SOON GON TO GOING TO THE THE GREAT JUNGLE OF YE YOU KNOW POST AUNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION AND AN FOR ME I FOUND MASTERY TO BE AN ABSOLUTELY TRANSFORMATIVE BOOK IN THAT IT TAUGHT ME SO MUCH ABOUT HOW TO LEARNE FROM OTHERS HOW TO EXPECT CERTAIN TYPES OF UM INTERACTIONS WHEN ONE AND OF A SCIENCE THEMSELVES TO A MENTER AM AND VICE VERSE A AND IT TALKED ABOUT SOME THINGS THAT WILL GET INTO IN MORE DEPTH TO DAY BUT NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS ABOUT IDENTIFYING THAT AM UNIQUE SEED THAT EXISTS WITHIN ALL OF US THAN CAN GUIDE OUR BEST DECISIONS IN TERMS OF FINDING OUR PURPOSE AND IT AND SO I YOUSUALLY END WITH A GREAT DEBT OF GRATITUDE AND I' PROBABLY DO THAT AGAIN ANAGAIN BUT I WANT A START WITH A GREAT DEBT OF GRATITUDE YOU THINK A MASTERY TRANSFORM MY ENTIRE LIFE AND AN IN MANY WAYS THIS PODCAST PROBABLY WON' EXIST WERE IT NOT FOR MASTERY BECAUSE IM IT REALLY EMBEDDED IN ME THIS IDEA THAT WE ALL HAVE A A DEEPER PURPOSE AND IT EXPLAINS HOW TO GO ABOUT FINDING THAT PURPOSE SO I TELL YOU THAT AND I ALSO WILL USE AS A SEGWAY FOR I'M ASKING YOU NOW SINCE I'M SURE PEOPLE'S EARS ARE PRICKED UP TO THIS SCOL HOW DO YOU FIND Y YOUR PURPOSE A'M COULD YOU SHARE WITH US WHAT IT IS TO FIND ONE'S PURPOSE AND HOW EARLY LIFE EVENTS PERHAPS CAN CUE US TO WHAT THAT PURPOSE IS FOR EACH OF US WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT THAT MARVELLOUS INTRODUCTIONIN AM ALMOST BLUSHING THAT'S THAT'S FANTASTTIC STORY IM WELL YOU KNOW BEING A HUMAN BEING IS NOT EASY IS SUPPOSED TO AN ANIMAL BECAUSE WE'RE BORN AND NOBODY GIVES US LIKE A DIRECTION OUR PARENTS MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT IN OUR COLLEGE TEACHERS AT CETERA MENT TOWARDS BUT GENERALLY WERE ON OUR OWN AND IT'S A VERY VERY DIFFICULT PROCESS YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT YOUR WHAT YOU CAN DO YOU COULD CHOOSE TWELVE DIFFERENT PATH CAN BE VERY CONFUSING AND VERY OVERWHELMING WHEN YOU FIND THAT SENSE OF PURPOSE WHEN YOU FIND WHAT I CALL YOUR LIFE'S TASK EVERYTHING HAS A DIRECTION EVERYTHING HAS A PURPOSE YOUR ENERGY IS CONCENTRATED IT'S NOT LIKE YOUR JUST GOING DOWN A SINGLE NARROW PATHWAY IT'S NOT LIKE LIFE BECOMES BORING AND IT'S JUST ABOUT DISCIPLINE AND SOLVING PROBLEMS IT'S ACTUALLY THE MOST EXCITING THING THAT CAN EVER HAPPEN TO YOU BECAUSE YOU NEVER HAVE THAT LOST FEELING YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING YOU GO YA THIS IS WHAT I NEED TO ACCOMPLISH PEOPLE COME AT YOU WITH ALL KINDS OF DISTRACTIONS AND BORING AND IRRITATING THINGS YOU ARE ABLE TO CUT IT OUT IT'S JUST THE MOST MARVELLOUS PIECE OF INTERNAL RATE ARE THAT YOU CAN HAVE SO I GENUINELY WISH THAT EVERYBODY CONFINED THAT KIND OF INTERNAL RADE ARE AND SO IT'S NOT EASY AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S NO LIKE INSTANT FORMING THIT BECAUSE WE'RE ALL ABOUT INSTANT FORMULAS IT'S DIFFICULT AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT SO IT'S NOT LIKE ROBER CAN GIVE ME THE ANSWER IN THREE MINUTES KNOW I CAN'T BUT THEREIS A PROCESS INVOLVED IT'S NOT IT'S NOT YOU KNOW A MYSTERY YOU CAN'T FOLLOW A VERY SINGULAR PROCESS AND THE IDEA IS YOUARE TALKING ABOUT CHILDHOOD THE WAY I LIKE TO FRAME IT IS WHEN YOU ARE BORN YOU ARE A PHENOMENON YOUR UNIQUE YOUR DEONAE HAS NEVER OCCURRED IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE GOING BACK BILLIONS OF YEARS IT WILL NEVER OCCUR IN THE FUTURE YOUR LIFE EXPERIENCES WITH YOUR PARENTS AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU EXPERIENCE IN YOUR EARLY YEARS GOING ON UP IS YOUR NIQUE IT'S YOURS YOU ARE ONE OF A KIND RIGHT SO THAT IS YOUR SOURCE OF POWER TO WASTE THAT IS JUST THE WORST THING YOU CAN DO IN YOUR LIFE AND WHAT WHAT THE POWER IS IS FINDING THAT UNIQUENESS WHAT MAKES YOU YOU AND HOW YOU CAN MIND THAT AND I CAN GO DEEP INTO IT AND USE THAT TO CREATE A CAREER PATH RIGHT AND SO I TELL PEOPLE WHEN YOUARE A CHILD WHEN YOUR FOUR OR FIVE OR EVEN YOUNGER YOU HAVE WHAT THE  GREAT PSYCHOLOGIST MASLOW CALLED IMPULSE VOICES THERE LITTLE VOICES IN YOUR HEAD THAT SAY I LOVE THIS I HATE THAT I LIKE THIS FOOD I DON'T LIKE WHEN MOMMI MOVES THIS WAY I LIKE WHEN DADDI COMES FROM HERE YOUR VERY CUTIN TO WHO YOU ARE IN WHAT YOU LIKE IN WHAT YOU DON'T LIKE AND THESE VOICES KIND OF DIRECT YOU IN CERTAIN WAYS RIGHT AND WHEN YOUR VERY YOUNG THEY DIRECT YOU TOWARDS INTELLECTUAL MENTAL PURSUITS AS WELL AND THERE'S A BOOK I RECOMMEND FOR EVERYBODY I IT'S HOWARD GARDENERS FIVE FRAMES OF MIND IT'S HELP ME IMMENSELY THE IDEA IS HE TALKS ABOUT FIVE FORMS OF INTELLIGENCE OUR PROBLEM IS WE THING OF INTELLIGENCE AS MOSTLY INTELLECTUAL BUT THERE ARE MANY FORMS OF INTELLIGENCE THERE'S THE INTELLIGENCE THAT HAS TO DO WITH WORDS THERE'S ABSTRACT INTELLIGENCE HAS TO DO WITH PATTERNS AND MATHEMATICS THERE'S CONNETIC INTELLIGENCE HAS TO DO WITH THE BODY THERE'S SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE HE HAS FIVE OF THEM AND THE IDEA IS YOUR BRAIN NATURALLY VEARS TOWARDS ONE OF THEM YOU CAN VEAR TOWARDS TWO OF THEM THAT HAPPENS BUT GENERALLY ONE OF THEM KIND OF DOMINATES RIGHT AND IT'S LIKE A GRAIN IN YOUR BRAIN THAT'S GOING IN A CERTAIN DIRECTION YOU WANT TO GO WITH THAT GRAIN AND CAUSE THAT'S WHERE YOUR POWER WILL LIE SO WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG IF YOU GO BACK AND THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU WERE FOUR OR FIVE YOU YOU CAN MAYBE GET A PICTURE OF SOME KIND OF DIRECTION OR VOICE IN SIDE OF YOU THAT WAS IMPELLING YOU TOWARDS THIS I KNOW FOR ME IT WAS WORDS I FROM I CAN REMEMBER AN OW SIX YEARS OLD I WAS JUST OBSESSED WITH WORDS JUST THE LETTERS IN WORDS ALMOST LIKE AN ALMOST SLIGHTLY SKITS OF FRANTIC WAY I WOULD SPELL WORDS BACKWARDS I WOULD TAKE THEM A PART I WOULD DO ANAGRAMS I TO PALENDRUMS RIGHT SO I HAD A THING ABOUT WORDS AND LANGUAGE IT'S VERY PRIMAL SOME PEOPLE YOU KNOW ALBERT INSTEINE WHEN HE WAS FOUR YEARS OLD HIS FATHER GAVE HIM A BIRTHDAY GIFT OF A COMPASS AND HE WAS JUST MESMERIZE BY THIS COMPASS THE IDEA THAT THERE ARE INVISIBLE FORCES OUT THERE IN THE COSMOST MOVING THIS NEEDLE AND HE SUST THE IDEA OF INVISIBLE FORCES STEVE JOBS WHEN HE WAS LIKE SEVEN OR EIGHT OR MAYBE YOUNGER IN BURLINGANE CALIFORNIA HIS FATHER THEY PASSED BY HIS STORE WITH TO TEGNOLOGICAL DEVICES IN THE WINDOW AND HE WAS JUST HYPNOTIZED BY THE DESIGN OF THOSE DEVICES IN THE GLASS TUBES IN EVERYTHING SO HE WANTED TO GO IN THAT DIRECTION YOU KNOW TIGER WOODS SAW HIS FATHER HITTING GOLF BALLS IN THE GARAGE AND HE WAS JUST LIKE SCREAMING WITH JOY HE HAD TO HE HAD TO DO THAT RIGHT IU I CAN GIVE YOU A MILLION DIFFERENT EXAMPLES OF THIS OF COURSE THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE FAME AUS OBVIOUSLY WE CAN GO BACK AND FIND THAT IT EASIER BUT WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU AND PLEASE COT ENOUGH OF I'M GOING ON TO LONG OR A PLECE GO WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU IS YOUR SEVEN NOW YOU'RE GETTING OLDER AND YOURE STARTING DID NOT HEAR THAT VOICE ANY MORE YOU'RE HEARING THE VOICE OF YOUR TEACHERS TELLING YOU YOU'RE NOT GOOD AT THIS FIELD YOU NEED TO GET BETTER AT MATH YOU KNOW YOU YOU SHOULDN'T BE INTERESTED IN THESE SPORTS ARE A YEU GOING THIS DRAT YOUR PARENTS ARE STARTING TO TELL YOU THIS IS THE CRUER THEY WANT YE ARE THE DIRECTION THEY WANT YOU TO GO IN RIGHT YOU START HEARING THAT MORE THAN YOUR OWN VOICE D AS YOU GET OLDER IT GETS WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE THAN WHEN YOUARE A TEEN AGER IT'S ALL ABOUT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE DOING YOUR PEERS WHAT'S COOL WHAT'S NOT COOL YOU KNOW AND THAT KIND OF IS MORE SO ALL OF THESE NOISE ENTERS YOUR BRAIN AND YOU CAN'T HEAR THAT ANY MORE YOU DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE AND SO YOU GO TO COLLEGE YOU KIND IT MAY BE CHOOSE A CA MAJOR THAT SEEMS PRACTICAL THAT YOUR PARENTS WANT YOU TO GO IN TO MAYBE YOU KIND OF WANDER AROUND YOU'RE NOT SURE AND THEN YOU ENTER THE WORK WORLD WITHOUT THAT INNER RATE OR THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT AND YOU BROTHER YOUR LOST RIGHT WHERE SHOULD I GO WELL I NEED TO MAKE MONEY RIGHT AND SO YOU MAKE A CHOICE BASED ON THE NEED TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY SOMP NOT EVERYONE BUT SOME PEOPLE DO THAT AND I UNDERSTAND THAT NEED  WE ALL NEED TO MAKE A LIVING BUT THAT CAN SET YOU OFF IN A VERY BAD PATH BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT CONNECTED EMOTIONALLY THE THING IS WHEN YOU FIGURE OUT THAT PRIMAL INCLINATION THAT GRAIN THAT'S INSIDE OF YOU THEN YOU HAVE THE THE ENERGY TO TO DO TO BE DISCIPLINED TO GO THROUGH BORING TASKS TO LEARN YOU LEARN AT A FASTERAC AUSE YOU'RE EMOTIONALLY ENGAGED WHEN YU'RE EMOTIONALLY ENGAGED IN A SUBJECT THE BRAIN LEARNS TWICE THREE TIMES FOUR TIMES AS FAST AS WHEN YOU'RE NOT I ALWAYS GIVE THE EXAMPLE IN COLLEGE I STUDIED FOREIGN LANGUAGES WHICH WAS KIND OF A PASSION OF MINE FOR THREE OR FOUR YEARS I STUDIED FRENCH AND THEN I WENT TO PARIS AND I COULDN'T SPEAK A WORD IT WAS IT WAS USELESS CAUSE IT DIDN'T TEACH ME ANYTHING PRACTICAL RIGHT I WAS TOTALLY CONFUSED AND THEN BUT I WAS IN PARIS AND I AND I LEVTD IN I WANT TO LIVE THERE RIGHT AND I HAD A GIRL FRIEND ON YEED TO SPEAK FRENCH TO HER AND I CAN TELL YOU IN ONE MONTH I LEARN MORE THAN THOSE FOUR YEARS OF UNIVERSITY BECAUSE I WANTED TO BECAUSE I WAS ENGAGED MY EMOTIONS WERE THERE IT WAS LIKE I HAD TO SURVIVE TO LEARN FRENCH WHEREAS SO MOST OF US WE DON'T HAVE A NEED REALLY TO LEARN THIS SUBJECT WE'RE HALF WERE PAYING HALF ATTENTION BUT WHEN YOU FIND THAT THING THAT REALLY CONNECTS TO YOU YOU'RE PAYIN DEEP ATTENTION YOU'RE EMOTIONS ARE ENGAGED YOU'RE LEARNING AT A MUCH FASTER RATE OQET AND SO THE THING IS HOW DO YOU FIND THAT WHEN YOU'RE OLDER WHEN YOU'RE TWENTY ONE I I I GIVE PEOPLE A LOT OF HELP AND IT'S USUALLY NOT SO DIFFICULT WE CAN GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS IT GETS HARDER WHEN YOU'RE THIRTY AND YOU'VE BEEN WANDERING ROUND BUT IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE I DIDN'T REALLY BUT START FIND MY EXACT PATH UNTIL I WAS THIRTY EIGHT THIRTY NINE TO BEONS SO THERE'S HOPE WHEN YOU GET FORTY AND OU GET FIFTY GETS MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT RIGHT AND IT'S VERY SAD IF YOU WASTED THAT SEED OF UNIQUENESS THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT AND I TELL ME WHETHER OUR WAYS OF GOING BACK WHEN WE GO THROUGH A PROCESS LIKE ARCHAEOLOGY WE HAVE TO DIG AND DIG AND DIG AND FIND THOSE BONES FROM YOUR CHILDHOOD THAT INDICATED WHAT YOU ERE MEANT TO DO BUT WHEN YOU FIND YOUR LIFE'S TASK EVERYTHING OPENS UP IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU FIGURED OUT OH I'VE GOT TO AIM FOR THIS PARTICULAR JOB WHEN I'M TWENTY EIGHT THAT IT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS IT GIVES YOU A SENSE OF DIRECTION YOU CAN TRY DIFFERENT THINGS YOU CAN EXPERIMENT YOU CAN HAVE FUN WHEN YOU'REIN YOUR TWENTIES YOURE CAN A LEARN YOU CAN LEARN SKILLS BUT IT GIVES YOU AN OVER ALL FRAME WORK INSTEAD OF OH ALL THIS CONFUSION THIS CHAOS SOCIAL MEDIATELY INTER NET I COULD GO HERE ERE HERE YOU'RE LOST AT SEA IT GIVES YOU A VERY IMPORTANT SENSE OF DIRECTIO AT COMPASS AS YOU DESCRIBE THIS  I HAVE THIS IMAGE OF A YOU KNOW YOU MENTIONED ANIMALS AM THAT PRESUMABLY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF THE NICHES THEY CAN EXIST IN BUT THE WAY I IMAGINE THIS PROCESS IS THAT IS A HUMAN WERE PLOPPED INTO A ENVIRONMENT AND HERE IAMUSING ANALOGY WHERE AM WE DON'T REALLY KNOW IF WE ARE IN A QUATIC ANIMAL A TERRESTRIAMAN OR A OR AN AVIAN RIORPHIBI OR AN AMPHIBIAN FOR THAT MATTER AM AND TO MAKE THE WRONG CHOICE TO BE AN IMPHIBIAN WHO IS TRYING TO FLY ALTHOUGH THEM SURE THEIR OUT THERE AM IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM A IT IT'S NOT JUST A WASTE OF TIME IT'S PROBABLY DEADLY AM AND NOT TO OVERDRAMATIZE THAT THE FAILURE OF FINDING ONE'S PURPOSE BUT I SEE IT THAT WAY WHEREAS A PERHAPS WE COULD JUST SAY THAT THE PROCESS OF FINDING ONE'S PURPOSES TO TO REALIZE I E AH YOU KNOW AM I'M AN APHIBIAN I CAN GO IN AND OUT OF WATER WHEREAS A BUNCH OF OTHER CREATURES AROUND ME STOP AT THE WATER'S EDGE RI RIGHT AND THIS IS REALLY COOL AND A BUNCH OF THESE OTHER THINGS LIKE THESE FLYING THINGS THAT THEY CAN'T ASHY EVEN GO IN THE WATER SOME OF THEM MIGHT N BE ON THE SURFACE OR DIVE INTO IT BUT THEY THEY CAN'T DO WHAT I CAN DO SO THE PROCESS OF SELF DISCOVERY IT SOUNDS LIKE ITS ABOUT A RESTRICTING ONE'S CHOICES TO A A A A SORT OF WEDGE WITHIN THE FULL LANDSCAPE OF OPTIONS AN AM YOU KNOW FOR ME I CAN CERTAINLY RECALL AFTER READING MASTERY IT HELPED ME RECALL SOME EARLY SEED EMOTIONS THAT I EXPERIENCED AS A VERY DISTINCT SENSATION IN MY BODY ON I'LL DESCRIBE THEM YA AM WET WITHOUT MAKING IT TO A SPECIFIC TO MY MY UNIQUE TASTES  YOUNOW AS A KID I LOVED AM FLORA AND FAUNA I LOVE LEARNING ABOUT BIOLOGY RENOUG SURPRISE THERE AM BUT ANIMALS AND HOW THEY MOVE IN PARTICULAR AND FISH AND GOING TO A A PROPER AQUARIUM STORE FOR THE FIRST TIME FOR ME AND GOING SNORKLING FOR THE FIRST TIMEAS LIKE WHOW AND IS EVEN AS I DESCRIBE ITS ALMOST LIKE MY BODY FLOATS I FEEL IT IN MY LEFT ARM OF ALL THINGS AND IT FEELS LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING TO DO ABOUT IT IT'S NOT JUST THAT I'M AN OBSERVATION OF THINGS THAT DELIGHT ME IS LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING THERE'S AN ACTIVATIENT STATE CREATED WITHIN ME LIKE I GOT TO DO SOMETHING WITH THIS AND TYPICALLY IT'S TELL EVERYBODY ABOUT IT UNTIL THEY WON'T LISTEN ANY MORE AM BUT OFTENTIMES IT'S TO ALSO DRAW THOSE THINGS TO THINK ABOUT THEM AND I JUST DELIGHT IN THEM IT'S A CONSTANT SOURCE OF DELIGHT AND SO SEEDS SUCH AS THOSE AND THERE ARE FEW OTHER THINGS IN THAT IN THAT LANDSCAPE OF FLORA AND FAUNA AND LEARNING ABOUT ANIMALS AND BIOLOGY INCLUDING THE HUMAN ANIMAL AND THEN ORGANIZING INFORMATION FEELS SO SATISFYING TO ME IT'S LIKE A DROG THAT IM AND SO I JUST FELT FEELS LIKE THIS YOU KNOW ETERNAL SPRING OF OF LIFE RIGHT AND SO FOR ME THAT'S WHAT IT WAS AND TO AND IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WHEN I WAS TEACHING THAT COURSE THE COURSE I LOVED BUT I WAS FEELING A LITTLE BIT ASTRAY AN MY SCIENTIFIC CAREER AND THEN I READ MASTERY AND I REALIZE YES I LOVE RUNNING A LABORATORY I LOVE TEACHING BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE FOR ME AND IT HAS TO DO NOT WITH A POTCAS AND EVEN OEN A PODCA I PROBY I KNEW WHAT A PODCAST WAS I WAS LISTENING TO PODCAST AF THAT TIME BUT UM BUT I WASN'T ON SOCIA MEDIA ID KNOW WITH THOUGHTS OF HAVING APODCAST BUT WHAT I WANTED WAS THAT FEELING IN IT'S TOTAL NUMBER OF FORMS RHAT'S THE GOLL GET THAT FEELING IN AS MANY FORMS AS POSSIBLE IAS THAT IS THAT ABOUT THAT'S IT'S THAT'S ABSOLUTELY PERFECT BECAUSE THE CONNECTION TO WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IT'S NOT AN INTELLECTUAL THING IT'S I IT'S VISERAL IT'S EMOTIONAL IT'S PHYSICAL RIGHT AND YOU FEEL IT IN YOUR BODY AND WHEN YOU'RE DOING IT IT'S LIKE IT'S AT YOU'RE LEVEL S LIKE YOU'RE SWIMMING WITH THE CURRENT YOU FEEL THAT THINGS ARE EASY EVERYTHING CLICKS TOGETHER THERE'S A DELIGHT NOT EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE DELIGHTFUL THERE'S GOING TO BE TEDIUM INVOLVED THERE'S GOING TO BE MOMENTS OF BOREDOM BUT YOU'RE ABLE TO WITHSTAND THE MOMENTS OF BOREDOM BECAUSE YOU FEEL THE DEEP OVER ALL CONNECTION SO YES THAT'S PRECISELY WHAT I'M TOG ABUT I MEAN IT'S FOR ME IT'STHE LITTLE IT ISA SIMILAR THING IS I SAID ABOUT WORDS BUT THE OTHER THING THAT I WAS OBSESSED WITH WHEN I WAS KID WAS EARLY HUMAN ANCESTORS DON'T ASK ME WHY I JUST WAS SO OBSESSED WITH OUR ANCESTORS MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO AND HOW IT'S POSSIBLE TO BE LIVING HERE IN THE SIXTIES OR SEVENTIES WITH CARS AND EVERYTHING BUT TO COME TO WHERE WE ARE NOW AND I WROTE ASA SHORT STORY WHEN I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD ABOUT A VULTURE IT WAS WRITTEN FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF A VULTURE WATCHING THE FIRST HUMANS KIND OF EMERGE ON THE PLANET I'M SURE WAS ABSOLUTELY AWFUL DREADFUL BUT THE WEER THING IS I'M WRITING A NEW BOOK AND ALL I'M DOING IN THAT BOOK IS GOING INTO EAR INTO EARLY HUMANS AND I FEEL LIKE A KID AGAIN I'M SO EXCITED I'M SO HAPPY SO I CAN VERY MUCH RELATE TO YOUR STORY YOU MENTION THESE FIVE DIFFERENT FORMS OF INTELLIGENCE OR FRAME FRAMES OF MIND AHOU REFERRED TO THEM IM AND I'M CERTAINLY WEAR THAT I LEAN TOWARDS HIM WERE INTELLECTUAL INTRESTS ALTHOUGH AS YOU POINTED OUT THE THE EXCITEMENT THE DELIGHT IS VICERAL AND THE ACTIONS ARE ACTIONS THERE OVER THE BODY ULTIMATELY I UM ONE HAS TO DRAW SPEAK RIGHT BOOKS ET CETERA IM TO TRANSMUTE THAT EXCITEMENT INTO SOMETHING REAL FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT AS INTELLECTUALLY TUNE BUT MAYBE ARE CINESTHETICALLY TUNE FOR INSTANCE IM I CAN ONLY WONDER WHAT THAT'S LIKE 'MNOT COMPLETELY UNCORDINATED BUT I DON'T THINK I HAVE A CINESTHETIC A TUNEMENT A ERE FRAME OF MIND BUT I'VE FOR INSTANCE M HAD A PODCAST LISTENER MENTION THAT THEY THINK IN FEELS THAT THEY LITERALLY EXPERIENCE FOUGHT AS A SECRET AS SORT OF A PATCHWORK OF A BODILY SENSATIONS I AND THAT THOUGHT FOR THEM IS NOT OF THE STUFF FROM THE NECK UP BUT ONLY FROM THE NECKDOWN WHICH TO ME WAS REALLY INTRIGUING AND SO I ONLY RAISE THIS BECAUSE A THERE HAVE TO BE IT AS YOU POINT OUT THERE'S AN INFINITE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SORT OF A ORIENTATIONS BASED ON OUR UNIQUE D'ANAE AND EXPERIENCE BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK EXPLAINS WHY THESE PARTICULAR SEEDS OR AS YOU POINT OUT LIKE THAT THE THE DIRECTION THAT THE GRAIN RUNS IN THE BRAIN AM AND IT'S IT'S PARTIALLY CAN BE NATURE IT'S GOING TO BE D'ANAE AM BUT WE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS AS IF THERE'RE SOME EXCITING OR ALL INSPIRING OR DELIGHTFUL THING THAT CAPTURES US CAN IT BE THE OTHER WAY TO CAN IT BE UM YOU KNOW ONE HAS A BAD EXPERIENCE AS A CHILD IN AN INTELLECTUAL ENVIRONMENT AND THEN BESIDES YOU KNOW II'M GOING IN THE THINGS OF THE BODY FEEL GOOD IF THINGS OF THE MIND OF INTELLECT FEELS BAD AND DOES IT MATTER WHETHER NOT WE ARE DRAWN TO OUR PURPOSE BY RECOGNIZING WHAT WE LOVE OR WHAT WE HATE AM OR ARE BOTH USEFUL OH THEY'RE BOTH VERY VERY USEFUL AM YOU KNOW A LOT OF INTELLIGENCE IS IS NOT IS NON VERBAL WE THINK CONCERNS OF IMAGES WERE WERE VERY MUCH INFECTED BY THE EMOTIONS OF OTHER PEOPLEL SO I KNOW FOR INSTANCE A MY MOTHER IS VERY VERY INTERESTING HISTORY SHE SUBSESSED WITH HISTORY AND I PROBABLY ABSORBED HER INTEREST IN HISTORY I DON'T THINK IS A GENETIC A GENE FOR THAT INTEREST YOU KNOW SO YOUR YEUGENO ABSORB THINGS FROM YOUR PARENTS AS WELSO IT'S NOT ALL JUST GENETIC BUT YET WHAT YOU HATE WILL PAY A BIG HAVE A BIG THING BUT THE PROBLEM WITH DOING THAT IS IF YOU GO INTO A DIRECTION IN YOUR ER AND ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ET CETERA AND THEY FORCE YOU TO LEARN MATH AND YOU HATE IT WHAT IT TENDS TO DO AS IT TURNS YOU OFF FROM LEARNING IN GENERAL THINK I DON'T WANT IT I DON'T WANT I DON'T WANT TO BEE DISCIPLIN I DO'T WANT TO GO THROUGH ANYTHING BECAUSE IT'S PAINFUL DOESN'T DELEAD ANYWHERE IT'S NOT ME AT FRUSTRATION IT TURNS YOU OFF FROM LEARNING IN GENERAL SO IT'S REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT FOR A CHIL ELD TO HAVE THE LOVE EXPERIENCE AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE SO THAT THEY CAN KNOW WHAT THEY HATE AND WHY THEY HATE IT RIGHT ANDEN THEN THEY CAN REBEL AND THEY CAN GO INTO THAT FIELD AS SUPPOSED TO I HATE LEARNING I HATE DISCIPLINE I HATE STUDYING I HATE TRYING THINGS OVER NOVER AGAIN IF YOUR CAN ESTHETICALLY ORIENTED AND YOU KNOW A PART OF ME I UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE I LOVE SPORTS IS YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO PRACTICE IT'S GOINGTO TAKE A LOT IT'S NOT YOURE NOT CAN INSTANTLY BE GOOD AT SOMETHING RIGHT AND THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE A LOVE OF IT RIGHT BUT IF YOUR MATH EXPERIENCE I HATE LEARNING SHIT YOU'RE NOT YOUS GOING TO TRANSFER TO SPORT YOUR GAIND I HATE DISCIPLINE IN GENERAL SO AS VERY IMPORTANT FOR PARENTS TO LET THAT CHILD HAVE AT LEAST GLIMMERS OF THAT LOVE MOMENT I KNOW FOR ME WHEN I AM FINISHED COLLEGE AND I ENTER THE WORK WORLD I HAD TO GET A JOB I GOT WORKED IN JOURNALISM I HATED IT I HATED WORKING FOR OTHER PEOPLE I HATED OFFICE POLITICS I HATED ALL THE EGOS I HATED THE SMARMINESS I HATED THE LACK OF QUALITY WAS ALL JUST ABOUT YOU KNOW MAKING MONEY IN GETTING THINGS OUT THERE AND THEN I WORKED IN HOLLYWIT I HATEIT HOLLYWAT I HATED WORKING IN HOLLYWOOD THAT FORMED ME VERY MUCH MAYBE GO IN THE DIRECTION THAT I WENTAND BUT ONLY FROM THE BASIS OF I KNEW THAT I WANT TO BE A RIDER SO YOU KNOW THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT IT'S NOT JUST HATE IT CAN FORM YOU BUT THERE ALSO HAS TO BE THAT POSITIVE DEEP EMOTIONAL LOVE OF SOMETHING THAT'S ALSIB IS GROUNDED IN YOU IN SOME WAY WHAT YOU JUST SAID REALLY HOGLIGHTS THE FACT THAT ENERGY AND MOTIVATION CAN COME FROM EITHER EITHER PRESSURE YOU DESIRE FOR SOMETHING OR DESIRE TO GET AWAY FROM SOMETHING AND 'M EARLIER WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW WE ARE SO MUCH MORE ENGAGED AND DRIVEN TOWARDS THINGS THAT STIR US EMOTIONALLY AND AND ACTUALLY WE KNOW BASED ON THE NORROW SCIENCE AS YOU KNOW TO I'M SURE THAT UM ONLY BY THE RELEASE OF CERTAIN OUR CHEMICALS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY WOULD OUR BRAIN HAVE ANY REASON TO CHANGE RIGHT IF YOU DON'T FEEL AGITATION AND YOU CAN DO EVERYTHING THAT YOUR TRHING TO DO OF COURSE YOUR BRAIN WHEDN CHANGE LIKE WHY WOULD IT IGHT THAT AGITATION IS A IS A SIGNATURE OF THE NERCHEMICALS THAT AR SAYING HEY SOMETHINGS DIFFERENT NOW RIGHT IGYOU MIGHT NEED TO DO SOMETHING DIFFENT INCLUDING REQUIRE YOURSELF RIGHT UM AND THAT CAN COME FROM POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES I'M OBSESSED WITH THIS IDEA OF ENERGY AND MAY WE ALL WONT T HAVE MORE ENERGY AND FOCUS AND NORMALLY WE HEAR ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF ENERGY IN THE CONTECTS OF COLORIC ENERGY LIKE WHAT SHOALL WE EAT AND WHEN AND HOW MUCH AND WE NEED TO GET SLEEP BUT WHAT YOU'RE REALLY REFERRING TO IS NORAL ENERGY I GET THE ENGAGEMENT OF OURSELVES THAT'S YOU KNOW A SITTING THERE READY TO BE ENGAGED BUT IT REQUIRES THE RIGHT EXPERIENTIAL MACRO NUTRIENCE IGHT THE EXPERIENTIAL MICRO NUTRIENCS I SUPPOSE TO OF COURSE WE NEED GOOD NUTRITION BUT THAT'S NOT SUFFICIENT IT'S NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT SO A WOULD YOU SAY THAT WHEN U WE ARE LET LET' AY SINCE A GOOD NUMBER OF OUR LISTENERS ARE IN ADULTHOOD UYOU AN FROM OUR TWENTYES ON THAT THE THINGS THAT EXCITE US AS ADULTS THAT REALLY GENERATE SOME FEELING AF READINESS OR OR GRAB OUR ATTENTION  ARE STILL INFORMATIVE TOWARD GUIDING OUR DECISIONS ABOUT BEST LIFE AND LIFE PURPOSE WELL A WHAT  WHUTD EXACTLY DO YOU MEAN BY THAT I MEAN LIKE BECAUSE THERE ARE THINGS THAT EXCITE YOU IN A KIND OF A QUICK WAY LIKE YOU KNOW WERE YOU HAVE TO RELIEVE SOME TENTION AND YUTHERE'SE ENTERTAINMENT THAN THERES THINGS THAT KIND GIVE YOU PRETTY IMMEDIATE GRATIFICATION THAN THERE'S THE LARGER PEPICTURE OF SOMETHING THAT WILL GIVE YOU FULFILMENT OVER YEARS TO COME SO YOU CAN FEEL THAT WHEN YOU'RE OLDER AND YOU CAN PAY ATTENTION TO IT BUT A LOT OF THE TIME IS WER WERE PAYING TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO THE IMMEDIATE PLEASURES OF LIFE TO WHAT GONES THIS INSTANT GRATIFICATION AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GRAVING FOR SO THIS IS A MUCH MORE KIND OF DEEPER PROCESS THAT INVOLVES THAT DIGGING THAT I WAS SAYING IT IT'S IT'S DEEPER THAN JUST KIND OF I LIKE THIS I DON'T LIKE THAT YOU KNOW KIND OF THING IT'S IT'S MORE IT'S MORE SOMETHING MACKROW THAN THAN JUST JUST THAT AND SO WHEN YOU'RE IN YOUR TWENTIES OR IN YOUR THIRTIES OR IN YOUR FORTIES YOU WANT TO BE PAYING ATTENTION TO YOURSELF AND THE PROBLEM WITH PEOPLE IN THE WORLD TO DAY IS YOU'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO YOURSELF YOURE NOT INSIDE YOUR OWN HEAD YOU DON'T HEAR THOSE VOICES YOU DON'T HEAR WHAT YOU LOVE WHAT YOU LIKE ANY MORE BECAUSE AS I SAID THERE SO MANY OF THESE OTHER DISTRACTIONS GOING ON AND SO YOU'RE ALWAYS LIKE A TUNE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE LIKE RIGHT BECAUSE YOU'RE IN SOCIAL MEDIA THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE ARE FOLLOWINGS IS WHAT THEY'RE INTERESTED IN AS OPPOSED TO DISENGAGING BACKING OFF FROM THAT AND LOOKING AT YOURSELF AND GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS OF THAT'S NOT ME ACTUALLY I DON'T REALLY LIKE THAT YOU KNOW IT'S OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS I THINK VERY PROFOUND IS LEVELS OF FRUSTRATION OR ANXIETY ARE OF DEFINITE SIGNALS THAT YOU MUST PAY ATTENTION TO THAT YHOY'RE TELLING YOU THIS ISN'T A GOOD DIRECTION FOR THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME FOR YOU AND IN GENERAL I TELL PEOPLE SELF AWARENESS BEING ABLE TO HEAR THOSE VOICES TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR FRUSTRATION IS TELLING YOU SOMETHING AND SOMETIMES YOU YOU JUST ACT ON IT WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING IT BUT UNDERSTANDING WHY YOU'RE FRUSTRATED WHY YOU DON'T LIKE YOUR CAREER WHY YOU'RE NOT HAPPY ABOUT WHERE YOU'RE GOING IS THE KEY TO EVERYTHING IT WILL OPEN UP IT WILL BE ACTUALY BE ABLE EVEN IN YOUR THIRTIES TO RETURN YOU TO THAT CHILDHOOD INCLINATION BUT IF YOU CAN'T LISTEN TO WHERE THOSE EMOTIONS COME FROM THAN THEY'RE USELESS THE'RE NOT TEACHING YOU ANYTHING AS WE ALL KNOW QUALITY NATRICION INFLUENCE IS OF COURSE OUR PHYSICAL HEALTH BUT ALSO OUR MENTAL HEALTH AND OUR COGNAT FUNCTIONING OUR MEMORY OUR ABILITY TO LEARN NOU THINGS AND TO FOCUS AND WE KNOW THAT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURES OF HIGH QU ALITY NUTRITION IS MAKING SURE THAT WE GET ENOUGH VITEMENS AND MINERALS FROM HIGH QUALITY UNPROCESSED OR MINIMLY PROCESS SOURCES AS WELL AS ENOUGH PROBITICS AND PREBOTICS AND FIBER TO SUPPORT THASILY ALL THE CELLAR FUNCTIONS IN OUR BODY INCLUDING THE GUP MICROBIOM NOW I LIKE MOST EVERYBODY TRY TO GET OPTIMAL NUTRITION FROM WHOLE FOODS I DEALLY MOSTLY FROM MINIMALY PROCESSED OR NONPROCESS FOODS HOWEVER ONE OF THE CHALLEGES THAT I AND SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE FACE IS GETTING ENOUGH SERVINGS OF HGH QUALITY FRUITS AND VEGETABLES PER DAY AS WELL AS FIBER AND PROBIOTICS THAT OFTEN ACCOMPANY THOSE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THAT'S WHY WAY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND IN TWELVE LONG BEFORE I EVER HAD  PODCAST I STARTED DRINKING A G ONE AND SO 'M DELIGHTED THET A G ONE IS SPONSORING THE HUBERMANLABPODCAST THE REASON I STARTED TAKING A G ONE AND THE REASON I STILL DRINK A G ONE ONCE OR TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT PROVIDES ALL OF MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS THAT IS IT PROVIDES INSURANCE THAT I GET THE PROPER AMOUNTS OF THOSE VITEMENS MINERALS PROBIOTICS AND FIBER TO INSURE OPTIMAL MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY A G ONE YOU CAN GO TO DRINK A G ONE DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A SPECIAL OFFER THEY'RE GIVING AWAY FIE FREE TRAVEL PACKS PLUSS A YEAR SUPPLY OF VIDEMEN D THREE K TWO AGAIN THAT'S DRINK A G ONE DOKCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM THAT SPECIAL OFFER SO SOUNDS LIKE ONE OF THE GOALS IS TO ENGAGE IN WHAT I'LL JUST CALL FOR THE MOMENT UNADULTERATED SELF REFERENCING YOU KNOW UNADULTERATED  IN THE E ALL SENSES OF THE WORD BECAUSE AM AS A CHILD AS YOU POINT OUT A AT STAGES OF LIFE THAT ARE BEFORE PUBERTY THERE LITERALLY PRESECUAL U'M WHICH I THINK IS IMPORTANT RIGHT BECAUSE AM PUBERTY TO ME AS A NERBILE GUST YOU START OFF AS A DEVELOPMENTAL NERBIOLOGIST I CAN TELL YOU THAT PUBERTY IS THE MOST PROFOUND TRANSFORMATION THAT THE BRAIN UNDERGOES FORIN THE ENTIRE LIFE SPEN THERE'S ABSOLUTE NO QUESTION ABOUT IT EVERYTHING IS DIFFERENT AFTER PUBERTY BECAUSE OF ALL THE NEW RELATIONAL DYNAMICS THAT BECOME APPARENT AN OUR POTENTIAL INVOLVEMENT IN THEM IT'S JUST IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S NOT TALKED ABOUT ENOUGH HOW DRAMATICALLY PUBERTY CHANGES THE BRAIN I MAY WE ARE DIFFERENT PEOPLE BEFORE AND AFTER PURIONS ERE SUDDENLY RAGING THE HORMONS ARE THERE AND IT'S NOT JUST CHANGES IN HOW WE VIEW THE WORLD BUT CHANGES IN HOW THE WORLD VIEWSE US YEAND NOT JUST THROUGH THE LENDS OF SEXUALITY BUT ALSO A' EXPECTATION OF WHAT WE ARE CAPABLE OF WHAT WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OR NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR LEARNING CAPACITY AMINPUBRITY IS LIKE THIS YOU KNOW IT'S ALSO THE MOST RAPID STAGE OF AGING IN OUR ENTIRE LIFE SPEN I JUS GIV THE GOHOM FOR SUMMER AND THEN COME BACK IKE SHAVING YOU KNOW EHEE I I OBSERVE ALATE I WASN'T LATE BLOONBRID ALONG PROTRACTED PUBERTY BUT I REMEMBER THOSE KIDS I'M SURE WE OUGHT WE ALL REMEMBER THOSE KIDS I'M EVERYTHING CHANGES AND SO I THINK PRIOR TO PUBERTY THE SEED SAYS YOU'VE DESCRIBED THEM OF OF DELIGHT OR OF RESISTANCE TO THINGS HINK THERE ARE UN ADULTRATE THY'RE NOT CONTAMINATED WHY THE VOICES AND EXPECTATIONS OF OTHERS AND SO I CAN SEE THE CHALLENGE OF REACHING BACK TO THOSE AS AN ADULT I'M I WONDER IF THIS RELATES TO I'M SOMETHING THATI'VE HEARD YOU TALK ABOUT BEFORE ALTHOUGH PERHAPS NOT AS MUCH AS SOME OF THE OTHER TOPICS YOU'VE DISCUSSED PUBLICLY WHICH IS I'M THE REAL VERSES THE FALSE SUBLIME OH I'M COULD YOU PERHAPS JUST DEFINE FOR US WHAT SUBLIME REALLY IS WHAT A SUBLIME EXPERIENCE IS AND AND THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN REAL AND FALSE SUBLIME EXPERIENCES BECAUSE I I FEEL LIKE THIS RELATES A REFINDING THAT SED RIGHT IT'S ABIT'S ABOUT FINDING AUTHENTIC SEEDS OF WITHIN US I SUPPOSED TO WENT EMOTIONS CAN BE DISTRACTING AN MISLEADING OH I NEVER THOUGHT NEVER MADE THAT CONNECTION AND IT'S THE BOOK THAT I AM WRITING WRIGHT NOW SO THANK YOU FOR THAT I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT I'M ACTUALLY AM WRITING A BOOK ON THE SUBLIME AND IM I HAVE SEVERAL WAYS OF KIND OF IL TRITING I GENERALLY LIKE TO USE A METAPHOR AND THE METAPHOR IS THAT BEING A HUMAN BEING BEING A SOCIAL HUMAN BEING LIVING IN A PARTICULAR CULTURE MEANS THAT YOU LIVE INSIDE OF A CIRCLE AND THAT CIRCLE OF THAT TIME ARE THE CONVENTIONS OF THINKING OF IDEAS THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE OF BEHAVIOUR THAT IS ACCEPTABLE THIS IS WHERE YOU WHERE YOU CAN GO MENTALLY WHERE YOU GO PHYSICALLY YOU KNOW ALL THE CODES AND CONVENTIONS SO THAT CIRCLE FOR ANCIENT EGYPT AND FOR TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AMERICA THEYVE OBVIOUSLY VERY DIFFERENT BUT IT'S THE SAME CIRCLES THE SAME LIMITING FACTOR YOUARE NOT SUPPOSED TO GO OUTSIDE OF IT THESE ARE THOUGHTS EXPERIENCES BEHAVIOUR YOUARE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO THE SUBLIME IS WHAT LIVES JUST OUTSIDE THAT CIRCLE OM THE WORDS SUBLIME COMES FROM ON THE THRESHOLD OF IT'S LIKE HERE'S A DOOR AND THE SUBLIME IS LITERALLY AT THE THRESHOLD OF THE DOOR YOUR LOOKING OUT INTO SOMETHING ELSE RIGHT AND THE QUINDESSENTIAL SUBLIME EXPERIENCE IS A NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE YOUR STANDING ON THE ON THE DOORWAY THE THRESHOLD OF DEATH ITSELF RIGHT AND SO IN MY BOOK I AM ILLUSTRATING THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF SUBLIME EXPERIENCES THAT YOU CAN HAVE IN RELATION TO THE COSMOST IN THE RELATION TO THINKING ABOUT BEING ALIVE JUST BEING ALIVE IS THE STRANGEST SENSATION YOU CAN POSSIBLY HAVE I HAVE I KNOW THAT VERY PERSONALLY AFTER MY STROKE I GO INTO CHILDOT CHAPTER O CHILDHOOD AND HOW SUBLIME YOUR OWN CHILDHOOD WAS I GO INTO ANIMALS RELATION TO ANIMALS I GO IVE A CHAPTER ABOUT THE BRAIN CHAPTER ABOUT LOVE I'M WORKING RIGHT NOW ON A CHAPTER ABOUT HISTORY OQETE BUT WHAT I AM TRYING TO SAY IS THE HUMAN BRAIN IS WIRED FOR THESE EXPERIENCES IS WIRED FOR TRANSENDENTAL EXPERIENCES THAT TAKE US OUT OF THE NARROW LITTLE REALM THAT WE LIVE IN BECAUSE WE'RE AWARE OF OUR DEATH IS THE ONLY ANIMAL TRULY CONSCIOUS OF ITS OWN MORTALITY AND IT FRIGHTENS THE HEL OD OF US AND THE IDEA THAT WE CAN SEE SOMETHING LARGER THAN THAN JUST TH THE THE BANAL PARTS OF OUR LIFE IS A DOORWAY THAT OPEND ALLOWS US TO KIND OF TRANSCEND THE MOMENT TO FEEL CONNECTED TO SOMETHING LARGER TO FEEL CONNECTED TO SOME POWER IN THE CAUSEMOST TO EVOLUTION ITSELF RIGHT AND SO WE'RE WIRED FOR THAT AND I'M WRITING A CHAPTER NOW ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND YEARS AGO AT THE MOMENT WHERE I THINK THE SUBLIME WAS BORN IS A STORY THAT I'M TRYING TO ILLUSTRATE RIGHT NOW AN WITH OUR UPPER PALEOLIFIC ANCESTORS SO IT'S DEEP IN SIDE OF US WE NEED IT WE HAVE TO HAVE IT AND THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WE HAVE VERY FEW AVENUES FOR IT ANY REAL AVENUES RELIGION USED TO BE THE MAIN KIND OF WAVE OF ACCESTING THIS AND SO BECAUSE IT'S SO DEEP WE REACH FOR FALSE FORMS OF THE SUBLIME THAT GIVE US THE SENSE THAT WE'RE WE'RE TRANSCENDING BUT IT'S NOT AT ALL BECAUSE SUBLIME HAS TO COME FROM WITHIN IT'S AN EXPERIENCE THAT YOU HAVE THAT YOU'RE GENERATING IN YOUR OWN MIND IN YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE THE FALSE SUBLIME COMES FROM OUTSIDE IT COMES FROM DRUGS IT COMES FROM ALCOHOL IT COMES FROM SHOPPING IT COMES FROM ONLINE RAGE IT COMES FROM JOINING A CAUSAND JUST GETTING OUT ALL YOUR AGGRESSION AND VIOLENCE RIGHT IT COMES FROM CAUSE AS IT COMES FROM A DICTIONE IT CAY IT GIVES YOU A SENSE IT CALMS YOU DOWN AND MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON IN LIFE BESIDES YOUR JOB THAT YOU'RE YOURE SICK OF BUT IT'S NOT REAL IT'S NOT LASTING IT'S FALSE IT'S AN ILLUSION IT'S NOT BASE ANYTHING REAL IT'S NOT CONNECTING TO THAT DEEP PART OF HUMAN NATURE THAT'S WIRED FOR THESE EXPERIENCES SO WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU HAVE TO HAVE MORE AND MORE AND MORE AND MORE OF IT YOU HAVE TO HAVE WE KNOW MORE OF THIS RUSH YOU NEED MORE OF THE DRUG ANY MORE F THE ALCO YOU MORE OF THE SECTION YOU MORE OF THE BORN IT'S NEVER GOING TO SATISFY YOU BUT THE REAL SUBL IME YOU DON'T HAVE THAT FEELING IT'S LIKE IT'S TRANSFORMATIVE WHENCE YOU FEEL IT IT LAST FORE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE IT'S WHAT MASLOW AGAIN CALLED THE PIQUE EXPERIENCE SO THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAULTS AND THE REAL SUBLIME I HAVEN'T QUITE CONNECTED IT TO WHAT YOU WOULD SAYING BUT IF I THINK ABOUT I THINK YOU'RE OUN SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING IMAYBE THE CONNECTION I WAS TRYING TO DRAW WAS A DOESN'T HOLD BUT Y FOR ME A THOSE EARLY EXPERIENCES OF SEEING THINGS THAT JUST DELIGHTED ME IN A WAY THAT FELT LIKE THAT NOT ONLY IS IT WAT THAT THE THE THOUGHT PROCESS S LONG TIME AGO WHEN SOMETHING LIKE OH MY GOODNESS I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS EXISTS THIS IS SO COOL THIS IS THE COOLEST THING AND SO CULL CLEARLY CREATE AN ACTIVATIONS STATE WITHIN ME BUT THEN THERE WAS ALSO A THOUGHT AND A FEELING OF GENELATIS IS OR PRE OF PREVERB IT'S NOT TRULY PREVERBAL I COULD SPEAK AT THAT AGE BUT IT WAS AM THAT'S OF ME AND I'M OF IT RIGHT THERE'S A CONNECTION THERE AND THEN IT WAS THERE'S SOMETHING TO DO ABOUT THIS THE ACTIVATION STATE CREATED IN THE BODY WAS IT YOU KNOW I I NEED TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS I NEED TO TELL PEOPLE ABOUT THIS I NEED TO THINK ABOUT THIS I NEED MORE EXAMPLES OF THIS AND SEE WHETHER OR NOT THERE ALL LIKE THIS YOU KNW ET CETERA ET CETERA AM SO CERTAINLY IT MEET SOME OF THE CRITERIA OF A SUBLIME EXPERIENCE AND I KNEW AGAIN WHEN I WAS IN GRADUATE SCHOOL IN AGAIN WHEN I WAS A YOUNG PROFESSOR ABOUT TO TRANSITION A TEN YURE THAT I NEW WAS GONGOING TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT WAS AS IF I WAS ON THE THRESHOLD OF SOMETHING WHET I DIDN' KNOW WHAT THAT NEXT THING WAS BUT I COULD TRUST IT BECAUSE OF THAT EARLY EXPERIENCE OF KNOWING THAT'S THE THREAD I LIKE LIKE I'M AN INPHIBIAN THIS IS MY ENVIRONMENT AND YOU'RE AN INPHIBIAN TOO IAND WE'RE DIFFERENT INPHIBIANS BUT YOU KNOW WERGAN TO BEAMPHIBIANS TOGETHER I AND THEN AND THERE'S A PERMANENCE TO IT THAT IT DOES SEEM TO TRANSCEND TIME I M I'M OBSESS WITH TIME PERCEPTIONS OI HOUVT TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO GO OFF ON A TANSION ATHA BUT AT THE HUMAN BRAINS ABILITY TO FIND SLICE OR MACKERO SLICE TIME 'S INCREDIBLE AND AND IT'S BEEN SAID OF AM NOT JUST A DICTIONS BUT ALSO INTERACTIONS WITH TOXIC PEOPLE THAT THEY MURDER TIME BUT THAT THAT HUMANS HAVE A I THINK IT WAS YOUNG I 'LL LOOK IT UP BUT I'M ONE OF THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGISTS SAID SOMETHING TO THE EXTENT THAT I'M ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOURS THOUGHT PATTERN SUBSTANCES ARE HUMANS ATTEMPT TO MURDER TIME SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO ADDRESS THEIR MORTALITY E AND THAT'S ALWAYS MADE A LOT OF SENSE TO ME I ALWAYS THE KILL TIME IS OR EXPRESSION KILL TIME THROUGH PASSIVE ENGAGEMENT BUT ALSO KILL TIME THROUGH I'M TRYING TO GET OVERWHELMED OR OVERTAKEN BY AN EXPERIENCE OR A SUBSTANCE I SUPPOSE TO WHEN YOU'RE TRULY CONNECTED YOU HAVE THAT SENSE OF FLOW AND THREE HOURS CAN PASS BY AND YOU NOT EVEN AWARE OF IT SO TIME IS A TOTALLY SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE IT CAN BE EXTREMELY SLOW AND TEDIOUS AND FEEL VERY DEPRESSED OR IT CAN PASS BY BUT THAT PASSES BY WITHOUT YOU EVEN NOTICING IT AND IT'S A WONDROUS EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW WHEN I'M DEEP IN MY WRITING I'M NOT AWARE OF THE TIME PASSING I'M SO INVOLVED IM SO IMMERSED IT'S A DEEPLY DEEPLY PLEASURABLE EXPERIENCE OF TIME IT IS SUBLIME AND YES SO I AGREE WITH YOU I THINK YOUR DISTINCTIONS VERY INTERESTING I'M EAGERLY AWAITING YOUR YOU'R NEXT BOOK BUT WE WON'T RUSH YOU WELL I'M I'M SO IMMERSEINT THAT I COULD I COULD TALK FOR HOURS AUS I ALSO HAVE A CHAPTER IN THERE ABOUT WHAT I CALL THE DAME ON WHICH IS LIKE THAT VOICE INSIDE OF YOU THAT SPEAKS TO YOU AN I'M WRITING WOLD CHAPTER ABOUT HOW SUBLIME THAT IS WHEN YOU CONNECT TO THAT VOICE SO YOU AVE SPOT ON THERE IS SOMETHING VERY MUCH CONNECTED TO MASTERY IN THIS BOOK BUT IT'S THE NEXT CHAPTER THAT IAM WRITING ANTASTIC ICAN'T WAIT I CAN'T WAIT I LIKE TO SHIFTS LIGHTLY TO A TOPIC THAT YOUVE WITTEN EXTENSIVELY ABOUT WHICH IS POWER AM AND NOT JUST POWER BUT ALSO SEDUCTION WHICH YOU'VE WRITTEN EXTENSIVELY ABOUT AND OF COURSE YOU'VE WRITTEN ABOUT FINDING ONE'S PURPOSE SO TELL ME IF THE FRAMEWORK THAT I'VE JUST GIVEN MYSELF LIBERTY TO CREATE IS AN ACCURATE ONE AND IT IF IT'S NOT  AM HOPING THAT AM IT'S NOT IN PERHAPS SOME INTERESTING WAYS SO TO ME YOU TALK ABOUT AND WE WILL TALK ABOUT POWER AS AS A RESOURCE IT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT A IT'S THERE IS A RESOURCE HAT IT COULD BE USED OR NOT USED AM AND I THINK OF SEDUCTION AS ONE FORM OF EXCHANGE BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL SO THERE'S A VERB ASSOCIATE WITH SEDUCTION POWER I'M THINKING OF MORE IS A NOWN IN THIS CONTEXT YOU'RE THE WORD GUY AM AND THEN YOU KNOW PURPOSE IS A IS REALLY ABOUT FINDING LIKE TO WHAT END OR ENDS ONE IS GOING TO A DEVOTE POWER SEDUCTION AND THE OTHER FORCES THAT ALLOW HUMAN BEINGS TO INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER IN THE WORLD AM BUT POWER AS A RESOURCE THAT CAN BE EXPRESSED IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND ACCESS IN DIFFERENT WAYS MAY WE COULD JUST EXPLORE THAT LITTLE BIT BECAUSE YOU WHEN WE HEAR THE WORD POWER I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE CON BRACE THEMSELVES AT HERE WE GO SO ONESGOING TO TRY NTO HAVE POWER OVER ME THIS IS ABOUT MANIPULATION AND SO ON AND SO FORTH BUT I LEARNED PRETTY EARLY ON THAT EVERY EVERY CAREER ENDEAVOR THERE' THER POWER DYNAMICS THER'S MENTOR MENTEE THEIR TEACHERS AND THEIR STUDENTS AND BOTH HAVE POWER AM IN INTER IN ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP THERE'S A POWER EXCHANGE THEIR YESSES AND THEIR KNOWS THERE ARE MAYBES THERE ARE AM A COVERT AND OVERT CONTRACTS I'LL DO THIS BECAUSE I WANT TO YOU'LL DO THIS BECAUE YOU WANT TO GREAT SOUNDS GREAT OVER CONTRACT THERE ALSO COVERT CONTRACTS WELL I DON'T FEEL SAFE DOING THAT SO WHAT I'LL DO AS I'LL TAKE SOMETHING ON THGM THE INTERACTION THAT YOU'RE NOT AWARE OF SO THAT I CAN SORT OF EMUN EASE MY SENSE OF DANGER AND MAKE MY GIVE MYSELF THE ILLUSION OF FEELING SAFE AND ALL SORTS OF KIND OF COMPLICATED HUMAN DYNAMICS THAT HAVE TO DO WITH US HAVING THIS FORBRAIN THING THAT CAN DO ALL OF THAT GYMNASTICS SO MAY WE GUL START VERY SIMPLY BY JUST SAY HOW WOULD YOU DEFINE POWER IN TERMS OF ITS A FUNCTIONAL DEFINITION LIKE AN INAN INTERPERSONAL RELATIONS AND THEN WHY DO YOU THINK POWER S SO ESSENTIAL TO ALL RELATIONSHIPS THAT'S REALLY WHAT ID LIKE TO GET TO WHY IS IT SO ESSENTIAL WHY COULDN'T IT BE SOMETHING ELSE WELL THE WAY I DEFINE POWERS I TRY AND TAKE IT AWAY FROM THAT KIND OF NEGATIVE CONTECTS THAT MOST PEOPLE HAVE THAT YOU THAT YOU BROUGHT UP AND I BRING IT TO SOMETHING VERY PRIMITIVE AND VERY PRIMAL THE WAY THE HUMAN BEING IS WIRED THE FEELING THAT WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVE OUR ENVIRONMENT AND IN THE EARLIEST PERIOD IT WAS LITERALLY OVER OUR ENVIRONMENT AN WILD ANIMALS TAN NATURE AND AND CLIMATE ET CETERA BUT NOW THE SENSE THAT YOU HAVE NO CONTROL OVER YOUR CAREER OVER YOUR CHILDREN OVER YOUR PARENTS IS DEEPLY DEEPLY IMMISERATING AND IT COMPELS US TO ACT IN CERTAIN WAYS EITHER ATTEMPTS TO FIND POSITIVE WAYS OF POWER OR DOING WHAT YOU CALL COVERT WAYS OF GETTING POWER YOU KNOW PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE TRADITIONALLY PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE MEANS SO IS DEEPLY WIRE IN US TO WANT A DEGREE OF CONTROL OVER THE IMMEDIATE ENVIRONMENT AND IMMEDIATE EVENTS WE CAN NEVER HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL AND THE IDEA OF HAVING COMPLETE CONTROL IS NONSENSE AND IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE VERY UGLY BECAUSE YOU WANT A DEGREE OF LETTING GO AND LETTING CIRCUMSTANCES COME TO YOU ET CETER ET CETERA SO THE SENSE OF YOU YOU WANT TO FEEL LIKE WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND RELATIONSHIPS THAT YOU CAN INFLUENCE THEM THAT YOU CAN MOVE THEM IN A CERTAIN DIRECTION EITHER TO GET YOU TO LOVE YOU AND TREAT YOU BETTER OR EITHER TO STOP ANNOYING IRRI ATING BEHAVIOURS OR EITHER TILL YOU KNOW WAKE UP AN AN FINE  N DU PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITY THAT'S YOUR CHILDREN ET SCETERA YOU WANT TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO INFLUENCE PEOPLE TO MOVE THEM IN A CERTAIN DIRECTION EITHER IN YOUR INTEREST OR IN THEIR INTERESTS RIGHT AND ONCE YOU HAVE THAT NEED AND EVERY SINGLE HUMAN BEING EVER WHOSE EVER LIVED HAS THAT NEED AND WE OFTEN DON'T RECOGNIZE HIT BECAUSE WE'RE EMBARRASSED BY WE'RE EMBARRASSED BY OUR DESIRE FOR POWER FOR OUR NEED TO CONTROL EVERY HUMAN BEING HAS IT RIGHT AND IT'S NOT EASY BECAUSE HUMAN BEINGS ARE COMPLICATED THEY DON'T IF YOU SAY DO THIS NYOU TALKING TO YOUR SON HE'LL DO THE OPPOSITE OR LL DO SOMETHING ELSE YOU CAN'T JUST FORCE PEOPLE IN A DIRECTION RIGHT BY BEING OVERT IN TELLING THEM THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO YOU CREATE RESENTMENT YOU CREATE AN ENEMY THEY MAYNT BHEY MAY SAY YES YES DADDY YES HUSBANDI'LL DO WHAT YOU SAYT BUT THER THER THEGING TO RESIST YOU DEEP DOWN INSIDE RIGHT SO PEOPLE ARE TRICKY THEY WEAR MASKS THEY PRETEND TO SAY ONE THING AND THEY DO ANOTHER THEY HAVE THEIR EGOS AND YOU INADVERTENTLY WOUND THEIR EGOS OR TRIP THEM INSOME WIGHT AND THEY REACT IN A WAY THAT YOU DON'T EXPECT AND SO POWER IS THIS KIND OF INVISIBLE REALM THAT ENVELOPS SOCIETY WHERE PEOPLE ARE CONTINUALLY BATTLING EACH OTHER AN STRUGGLING IN IT BUT NO ONE IS LIKE TALKING ABOUT IT NO ONE'S BEING OVERT ABOUT NO ONE SAYING THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT IAM TRYING TO DO AND SO WHEN YOU ENTER THE SOCIAL WORLD IN THE CAREER WORLD YOURE NOT EXPECTING THESE BATTLES YOU DON'T NOT KNOW ONE'S TAUGHT YOU NO ONE STRAIN TO YOUR PARENTS DON'T TRAINOU NOBODY TRAINS YOU AND YOU MAKE MISTAKES AND YOU REALIZE HOW POLITICAL PEOPLE ARE IF YOU ARE A SHARKY CHARACTER IN THE THERE'S THE SERD PERCENTAGE OF THEM YOU REALIZE WOW I CAN DECEIVE PEOPLE I CAN MANIPULATE THAM I CAN GET WHAT I WANT I CAN PRETEND TO LOVE THEM AND THEY'LL THE FALL FOR ME AND I CAN DO ALL THIS OTHER STUFF BUT F OR MOST OF US THE NINETYES FIVE PERCENT OF US WHO AREN'T SHARKS AND I'M 'M INCLUDING MYSELF IN THAT CATEGORY IT'S IS IT'S VERY VERY DISTURBING TO SUDDENLY ENTER THAT WORLD AND SEE ALL THAT INVISIBLE POWER GAMES ON THIT'S NO ONE'S GIVING YOU ANY ADVICE FOR HELPED YOU AND SO TAKE IT OUT OF THE REALM OF IT'S JUST ABOUT TRYING TO DOMINATE THE WORLD AND MANIPULATE AND EXPLOIT AND AN ABUSE IT'S SOMETHING INSIDE OF YOU YOU HAVE THIS NEED AND YOU'RE SUPPRESSION OF IT WILL ONLY MAKE YOU COME OUT IN PASSIVE WAYS AND YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO CONTROL CERTAIN THINGS IF YOU WANT TO MOVE PEOPLE IF YOU WANT THEM TO FOLLOW YOUR IDEAS IF YOU WANT THEM TO BE MORE ALINED WITH YOUR POLITICS OR YOUR IDEAS YOU HAVE TO BE SUBTLED YOU HAVE TO LEARN PSYCHOLOGY YOU HAVE TO LEARN CERTAIN ASPECTS OF HOWT ALMOST MOVE PEOPLE WITHOUT THEM REALIZE AGAINST AND CERTAIN DIRECTIONS WHICH JUST LIKE THE ART OF SEDUCTION AND IF YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED IN THAT F YOU'RE JUST GOING TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT YOU THINK OF WHAT YOU'RE CAN DO THAT MEANS YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED IN PRACTICAL ACTION YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED IN RESULTS YOU'RE JUST INTERUSTED INVENTING YOUR OWN FRUSTRATIONS OR YOUR OWN ANGER SO LEARNING THE SUBTLE LITTLE DYNAMICS OF POWER ITS EXTREMELY ESSENTIAL BECAUSE WE'RE A SOCIAL ANIMAL IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET DIRTY THAT YOU'RE OINGTO SUDDENLY GO OUT THERE MANIPULATE THE HELL OUT OF PEOPLE MOST OF THE FORTY EIGHT LAWS OF POWERS ABOUT DEFENSE BUT HOW TO DEFEND YOURSELF FROM THE SHARKS ABOUT THERE OW TO DEFEND YOURSELF FROM MAKING CLASSIC MISTAKES LIKE OUTSHINING THE MASTER LIKE TALKING TOO MUCH LIKE ARGUING WITH PEOPLE INSTEAD OF DEMONSTRATING YOUR IDEAS ON AND ON AND ON IT'S NOT AN UGLY THING IT ACTUALLY MAKES YOU A BETTER SOCIAL INDIVIDUAL SO THAT'S HOW I I LIKE TO FRAME IT VERY INTERESTING I THINK AS A YOUNG GUY GROWING UP IT WAS SO IMPORTANT TO ME IM TO KNOW WHERE I FIT I N WITH MY FRIEND GROUP UM AND I DIDN'T THINK OF IT SO MUCH AS A HIERCHY UM NOR WHEN I WAS IN MY ACADEMIC STAES DID I THINK OF IT AS A HIERKE EVEN THOUGH IT WAS CLEARLY WAS I U SO MUCH AS IT THE GOAL WAS TO FIGURE OUT WHERE WAS MY UNIQUE SLOT THAT I COULD U DO THE MOST GOOD FOR MYSELF AND OTHERS  A KIND OF FINDING MY SPOT I DONTN'T SAY ON A SHELF CAUSE THAT IT IT GIVES AN IMAGE OF SOMETHING VERTICAL BUT YOU KNOW IN THE LET'S MAKE IT LATERAL A LATERAL ARRANGEMENT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT STRENGTHS DIFFERENT LIFE PURPOSES TRYN TO FIGURE THEM OUT IT  WHIT WHERE SHOULD I BE IN ORDER TO EXPRESS THAT AND ALSO FEEL CONNECTED TO OTHERS AND UM AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT I DID HAVE TO I REALIZE NOW TAST ON YOUR ANSWER I DID HAVE TO FIGURE OUT U YWHO'S TRYING TO HAVE POWER OVER WHO'S PRETENDING THAT THEY DON'T WANT POWER BUT ISIT ACTUALLY EXERTING POWER UM YOU KNOW THESE SORTS OF THINGS AND THERE'S AN INCREDIBLE PEACE THAT COMES FROM KNOWING THAT ONE IS IN THEIR CORRECT PLACE BOTH PROFESSION INTER PERSONALLY IN RELATION TO ONESELF BUT ALSO IN THE CONTECTS OF ONE SPURE PURE GROUP HS KONDNON YET THIS IS WHERE I BELONG BECAUSE TRYING TO GAIN POWER WHEN ONE IS TRYING TO MOVE TO A POSITION THAT ISN'T RIGHT FOR THEM OR IN A WAY THAT ISN'T RIGHT FOR THEM JUST SEEMS SO ENERGETICALLY COSTLY I THING LIKE A WASTE OF A LIFE FRANKLY IIYO TRYING TO GATHER RESOURCES SIMPLY TO TO HAVE THEM TO GIVE THE ILLUSION OF POWER BUT THEN BEING AFRAID OF LOSING THEM JUST SOUNDS LIKE A RECIPE FOR FOR MISERY AS HE PPOINTED III KNOW WHERE AS FIGURING OUT WHERE AM I MOST POWERFUL IN THE BENEVOLENT SENSE OF THE WORD THAT THAT THAT SEEMS LIKE A GOOD A GOOD PURSUIT WA'S CONNECTING UP TO TO MASTERY AGAIN IN FINDING YOUR LIFE'S PURPOSE YOU KNOW II KNEW WHEN I WAS YOUNG THAT I COULDN'T EXERT PHYSICAL POWER BECAUSE I WAS A SKINNY LITTLE RUN AND I WAS I WASN'T BULLIED HAT PEOPLE WOULD KIND OF PICK ON ME ET CETERA ET CETERA SO I VEAR TOWARDS INTELLECTUAL PURSUITS WHERE I COULD HAVE POWER AND IN THE END YOU KNOW YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN A JOG AND YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE WELL AND HIGH SCHOOL BUT HOW HAD LOOK AT ME NOW I'M NOT SAYING THAT IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING THAT THAT'S BUT THAT'S PART OF HUMAN NATURE THAT DESIRE TO ACTUALLY YOU KNOWPROVE YOURSELF AND FIND THAT NICH THAT YOU THAT YOU BELONG TO SO YOU DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF HUMU THAT SENSE OF INFERIORITY WHICH ALFRED ADDLERD THE PSYCHOLOGIST DESCRIBES VERY ELOQUENTLY SO A LOT OF IT IS KIND OF COMPENSATING WHEN YOU'RE A CHILD FOR THINGS THAT ARE YOUR WEAKNESSES AND FINDING WHAT YOU'RE SO GOOD AT THAT YOU DO HAVE THAT POWER AND PEOPLE CAN'T BULLY YOU RIGHT IN YOU YOUR YOU'RE LIKE NOW A FAMOUS NARROW SCIENTIST WHEREAS THEY'RE LIKE WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE DOING KIND OF THING SO POWER DEFINITLY TT IS CONNECTED IN SOME WAY TO THAT INNER SENSE OF WHAT YOU ERE MEANT TO DO AND YOU FEEL IT WITH WITH THE EASE AND THE CONNECTION THAT COMES FROM IT RIGHT SO I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT MY DISLIKE OF WORKING FOR OTHER PEOPLE AND OFFICE POLITICS AND EGOS I NOW HAVE OF AN EXISTENCE WHY DON'T HAVE TO DEA WITH ANY OF THAT AND I'M SO BLESSED AND I WAKE UP EVERY MORNING AND I PRAY TO GOD THANK GOD I I FOUND THIS BECAUSE IT'S IT'S THE PERFECT LIFE STYLE FOR ME AND YOU'RE OR CAN BE ACCURATELY DES CRIBED AS AN INTELLECTUAL BEAST SO IT'S OND IN HWHICH IS AE A COMPLIMENT ORI AM WE HER THERE WERE BEAST AN WE THINK A YOU KNOW A FEROCIOUS BEAST TRYING O HAR OTHER BUT HAWTY BEING A BEAST EYOU KNOW IT'S I THINK FINDING WHERE WE CAN BE A BEAST YOU KNOW AN AND FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT'S PAINTING OR OR YEGARDENING OR WHATEVER IT MIGHT BER ON I THINK IT'S AGAIN TIES BACK TO THE THESE ISSUES OF AOR THIS QUEST OF FRMASTERY SEDUCTION IS IT ALSO A VERY LOADED WORK RIGHT EVEN MORE UGLIER THAN HOBECAUSE THE DUGTION RIGHT SEDUCTION KIND OF DRIPS WITH A THE IDEA THAT SOMEBODY IS TRICKING SOME ONE ELSE INTO DOING SOMETHING THAT THEY OTHERWISE WOULD NOT WANT TO DO BUT SEDUCTION IS BOTH OUR PROPENSITY TO DO IT AND TO HAVE IT DONE TO US IS HARD WIRED INTO OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM AND HAS ALLOT TO D WITH THE HYPOTHALMIS AND A MUCH OTHER AIR IS THAT I WON'T BOR US WITH THE NOMANCLATURE BUT A SEDUCTION TO ME IMPLIES SOME SORT OF EXCHANGE ISUPOSE WE COULD SEDUCE OURSELVES THROUGH DENIAL OR CONVINCING OURSELVES THAT OF SOMETHING BUT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT WEN WE'T IE ABOUT SEDUCTION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND INTERACTION BETWEEN TWO OR MORE PEOPLE SO AM WHAT ARE SOME OF THE QUARTRER PRINCIPLES OF SEDUCTION AND AND FOU CARE TO PLAY A ANTHROPOLOGIST A BIT A AND ANEROL SCIENTISTS II WOULD INVITE THAT WHY DO YOU THINK WE HAVE NERAL CIRCUITS IN OUR BRAIN THAT ALLOW US TO SEDUCE AND BE SEDUCED WELL A I DON'T KNOW HOW IF IF I'M IF IM BEING KIND OF AN ARMED CHAIR INTELLECTUAL HERE BUT BY MY THEORY IS SOME OF IT HAS TO GO BACK TO SOCIAL A EVENTS LONG IN OUR PREHISTORY WHICH HAVE TO DO WITH TABOOS AND SOCIETY WAS INITIALLY KIND OF ORGANIZED BY SERIES OF TABOOS RIGHT MOST NOTABLY THE TABOO ON INCEST AND WHAT HAPPENS IS JUST NOT MY THEORY ITS THE THEORY OF THE MALANOWSKY MALANOWSKI SAID ELS A IS AT THE MOMENT A TABOO ENTERS THE HUMAN BRAIN LIKE YOU NOT SUPPOSED TO SLEEP WITH THIS WOMAN THE DESIRE ARISES INSIDE OF YOU TO ACTUALLY SLEEP WITH THAT WOMAN THEN THE DESENSE OF NO SINCE IT THIS IS PROHIBITED STIRS THE DESIRE STIRS THE CONTRARY IMPULSES IN HUMANS AND WE CAN BE VERY A WHAT'S THE WORD PERVERSE CREATURES RIGHT SO IF YOU'VE EVER TRIED TO SUPPRESS A THOUGHT YOU REALIZE THE IT KEEPS COMING UP KEEPS COMING UP YOU CAN'T SUPPRESS IT DON'T THINK OF AN ELEPHANT ANSEWS WHUT EVER YOU O DON'T THINK OF AN ELEPHANT YOU'RE THINKING OF IT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HELP IT RIGHT THE IDEA THAT YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DESIRE THIS PERSON STIRS THAT ACTUAL DESIRE SO I BELIEVE THE SENSE OF SOMETHING BEING TABOO AND TRANSGRESSIVE IS THE ULTIMATE KIND OF ORIGIN OF OUR DESIRE FOR SEDUCTION BUT SEDUCTION INVOLVES VULNERABILITY IT INVOLVES SOMEBODY GETS INSIGDE SOMEBODY GETS UNDER OUR SKIN RIGHT AND TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO LET THEM IN SO THE PERSON BEING SEDUCED IS IN SOME WAYS TO A DEGREE COMPLICIT BECAUSE IF YOU JUST PUT UP A WALL AND YOU SAID NO I'M NOT GOING TO BE SEDUCED NOTHING WILL HAPPEN BUT YOU HAVE A VULNERABILITY YOURE LETTING THAT PERSON INTO YOUR PSYCHE INTO YOUR INNER SPACE THE PARADIME FOR THAT IS EARLY CHILDHOOD SO I FROY TALKS LOT ABOUT THIS WON ENOUGH PEOPLE STILL BELIEVE IN FROGT ANY MORE I A CERTAINLY TO OQUET ABSOLUTELY A YOUGENIUS HAV BOTH PSYCHOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY WRONG ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS DID A LOT OF THINGS HE SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE I LET'S ACKNOWLEDGE THAT  THINK EVERYONE WOULD AGREE THAT SLEEPING WITH YOUR PATIENTS AND BEING A COCANE ATIC BAD IDEAS BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE HAD AND ABSOLUTE LIKE MERE SUPERNATURAL LEVELS OF INSIGHT AND BRILLIANCE INTO HUMAN NATURE SLEEP WITH HIS PATIENT I BELIEVE HE DID OM BUT IF I JUST AS HE HAD I JUST THREW THAT OT HIM WITHOUT HIM DOING IT THEN YOU KNOW I FOR HE CERTAINLY HAD EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENTS TO HIS PATIENTS THAT HE SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD I DON'T KNOW IF HE SLET WITH THEM HE VERY WELL MIGHT HAVE BUT HIS IDEA WAS THAT THE CHILD IS SEDUCED BY THE PARENT YOU'RE AN EXTREMELY VULNERAL POSITION RIGHT YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON THEM AND THERE SEDUCING YOU WITH THEIR ENERGY YOUR LETTING THEM IN RIGHT AND THAT KIND OF CREATES A PATTERN FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE AND SO F R INSTANCE THE FEELING OF BEING CARRIED BY YOUR FATHER AND JUST BEING TAKEN AROUND PHYSICALLY IS A FORM OF SEDUCTION BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S GOING TO DUE TO YOU YOU'RE VERY EXCITED YOU WANT THAT SURPRISE RIGHT AND TO ME IT'S RELATED TO THE SEDUCTION OF A STORY STORIES ARE VERY SEDUCING TO US WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'RE TAKING US WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE NEXT CHAPTER IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THIS CHARACTER OR NOT THE SURPRISE LOWERS OUR RESISTANCE AND OPENS OUR MIND UP TO WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT IS A FORM OF SEDUCTION FAIRY TALES THE STORIES YOU WARE READING AS A CHILD YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH YOUR PARENTS THEY'RE DEEPLY DEEPLY INGRAINED IN YOU YOU CANNOT BE SEDUCED UNLESS YOU ARE VULNERABLE RIGHT AND SO I LIKE TO SWITCH THAT AROUND AND GET OUT OF THE NEGATIVE CONNITATIONS BEING VULNERABLE IS ACTUALLY A POSITIVE TRAIT I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE NOW IN THE WORLD TO DAY BECAUSE THINGS ARE SO HARSH AND INVASIVE THAT PEOPLE H BECOME TOO INVULNERABLE THEY DON'T WANT TO LET ANYTHING IN RIGHT AND THIS NOW INFECTS THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER PEOPLE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE INFLUENCED THEY THEY WANT TO BE STRONG INSIDE OF THEMSELVES THEY'RE AFRAID OF GIVING IN TO THE OTHER PERSON OF SURRENDERING TO THEIR INFLUENCE BUT IT'S ACTUALLY A DELIGHTFUL FEELING TO SURRENDER TO THE POWER OF ANOTHER PERSON AND THEN REVERSE THAT CHARGE AND HAVE THEM SURRENDERED TO YOUR POWER SO WHEN I'M READING A WRITER AND SOMETIMES A THEY COMPLETELY SEDUCED ME LIKE FREDERIC NICHES ONE OF MY FAVOURITE WRITERS I LET GO OF EVERYTHING I LET HIM ENTER MY BRAIN AND I'M COMPLETELY SEDUCED I LET HIM LEAD ME ALONG BUT THEN I ENCOUNTER WRITERS THAT I DON'T LIKE AT ALL I'LL MENTION ONE IF YELY KNOW THE PRIME NOT A GOOD THING BUT STEPHEN PINKER I DON'T LIKE STEPHEN PINKER IF IND AM REALLY ANNOYING OQUET A BUT I FORCE MYSELF TO TRY AND FIND A WAY TO BE SEDUCED BY HIM TO LET HIM INTO MY BRAIN TO SEE WHERE HE'S COMING FROM TO OPEN MYSELF TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT HE COULD BE CORRECT SO VULNERABILITY LETTING PEOPLE INTO YOUR MENTAL SPACE IS A FORM OF INTELLIGENCE ITS  IS THE KIND OF AN EMOTIONAL AND AN INTELLECTUAL INTELLIGENCE AND FORGIVE ME FOR INTERRUPTING BUT I THINK IT ALSO IMPLIES A LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE BECAUSE EMPATHY OR ALLOWING ONESELF TO BE VULNERABLE TO THE POINT WHERE YOU'RE SEDUCED BY SOMETHING I BY DEFINITION IF YOU'RE CHOOSING TO DO IT A IMPLIES THAT YOU ALSO HAVE THE CONFIDENCE THAT YOU CAN GET BACK TO YOURSELF AF ATOR WORTH RIGHT THEY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET LOST OF GROWING CIRCUMSTANCES THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE HIGH JACK TO THE POINT OF NO RETURN RIGHT OR IN SOME WAY THAT'S DETRIMENTAL TO YOU THATS  I SO IT IS UM IT MIT SUNNLY REALLY NURD HE HEAR ITS IT IT'S COLINEAR WITH WITH CONFIDENCE IN MANY WAYS SURE LIKE TAKE MY MIND AND TAKE IT WHERE YOU WILL BECAUSE I KNOW I CAN COME BACK AT ANY TIME RIGHT RIGHT AND THE SAME THING IN A PHYSICAL SEDUCTION IN A ROMANTIC SENSE RIGHT YOU'RE OPENING YOURSELF UP TO THE CHARM TO THE ENERGY OF THE OTHER PERSON BUT IF THEY START DI SPLAIN DARK ENERGY AND YOU SEE THAT THEIR BUSIVE OR SOMETHING IS WRONG YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO RETREAT AH WELL THERE GETS TRICK YOU GET I VERY TRICKY IT WELL BECAUSE THE ATTACHMENT SYSTEMS WHICH ARE ALSO ROOTED IN CHILDHOOD IM I OFTENTIMES CAN OVERWHELM ONE'S ABILITY TO RECOVER ONESELF LIKE I MEANG TO SERMING HOW MANY FIDE A DOLLAR FOR EVERY TIME SOME ONE IN THAT I KNEW MY LIFE SAYING LIKE YOU KNOW I KNOW THEY'RE BAD FOR ME BUT I JUST CAN'T THINKE WE JUST CAN'T SEEM TO DISENGAGE LIKE THAT YOU HEAR ABOUT THAT ALL THE TIME I MEAN YOU SEE COURT CASES ABOUT THIS THAT ARE PUBLIKE AND YOU KNOW YOUS GO WHY DON' THEY JUST WALK AWAY FROM ONE ANOTHER WELL CAUSE ONCE THOSE ATTACHMENT SYSTEMS ARE LOCKED IN IT ALMOST BECOMES IN AND HER METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING LIKE A PARENT CHILD RELATIONSHIP LIKE YOU CAN'T SUTTELY DECIDE YOUR PARENTS WEREN'T YOUR PARENTS SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU KNOW BETTER NOW YOU ARE FOR EVER STRICKEN WITH THE REALITY THAT THEY WERE AND THEY ADD AN IN FLUENCE AND I THINK THAT THAT ATTACHMENT SYSTEM IS UM IS IT IS A FORCE THAT TUGS PRETTY HARD YE AND A A LOT OF WOMEN HAVE WRITTEN TO ME SINCE THE ART OF SEDUCTION SORT OF SAYING THAT THEYR BOYFRIEND OR HUSBAND WAS APPLYING SOME OF THESE TACTICS ON THEM AND IT WAS VERY PAINFUL AND THEY WERE KIND OF A LITTLE BIT ANGRY AT ME FOR FOR THEN THE KIND OF REALIZE THAT THEY IT WASN'T THEY DIDN'T LEARN REALLY FROM MY BOOK OF AS AVERY KIND OF WIRED IN THEM BUT THAT READING ABOUT THESE TACTICS IN THESE STRATEGIES ACTUALLY HELP THEM TO RECOGNIZE WHAT THEIR HUSBAND OR BOYFRAND WAS DOING TO THEM THE MANIPULATION AND THE GAMES THAT WERE BEING PLAYED DO MEN WRITE TO YOU AND TALK ABOUT THE SEDUCTIVE ADORNMENTS THAT WOMEN AVE USED TO TO A BRING THEM INTO RELATIONSHIP AS WELLOWERS ARE YOUTIPICALLY HEARING FROM WOMEN I MOSTLY HEAR FROM WOMEN COMPLAINING ABOUT MEN ND AND AND HOW THEY'VE ABUSED THEM AND HOW THEY USED I SOME OF THESE SOME OF THES TRATEGIES I DONOT I DON'T DEN I HAVE A SLIGHTLY NEPARIOUS EDGE TO THEM BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO WRITE A BOOK ABOUT SEDUCTION THAT DOESN'T HAVE THAT TABBOO ELEMENT BECAUSE I SAY SEDUCTION INVOLVES THE TABOO AND I DIDN'T WANTED BUT IN WANT OF SENSOR MYSELF BUT FEMALE TO MALE SEDUCTION CLEARLY ALSO EXISTS VERY MAYIS O LA OFT I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT'S A LESS OFTEN IS IT PHYSICALLY ABUSIVE AM BUT RIGHT I MEAN FROM AN EARLY AGE BOTH BOYS AND GIRLS MEN AND WOMEN ARE COACHED BY SOCIETY ON THE SORTS OF A SEDUCTIVE TACTICS AND AND ADORNMENTS WRITE HIM IN EVERYTHING FROM MAKE UP PERFUME HERSTYLE'S CARS WATCHES JEWELRY A EXPRESSION POWER DISPLAYS OF ANY KIND A I MEAN THAT STUFF THE WORLD'S FILLED WITH THAT STUFF YET BUT MEN ARE GENERALLY KIND OF HAPPY WHEN A WOMAN SEDUCES THEM RIGHT THEYR UNLESS THEY WERE AFTER THEIR MONEY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHICH HAPPENS BUT GENERALLY THE SENSE YOU KNOW I TALK ABOUT THIS IN IN THE FIRST CHAPTER ABOUT THE SIRENS WHICH I SAYIS THE QUINTESSENTIAL ARCHETYPE OF THE FEMALE SEDUCTORESS THE THE KIND OF HA HUMAN HAVE BIRD CREATURE ON A ROCK SINGING SO BEAUTIFULLY THAT YOU HAVE TO JUMP IN THE WATERIN THEY KILL YOU AND SO THE IDEA IS THAT MEN WANT TO LET GO BECAUSE MEN HAVE TO BE SO UNCONTROL SO POWERFUL THOY HAVE TO PROJECT THIS IMAGE THEY HAVE A SECRET DESIRE TO LET GO AND BE ALMOST DOMINATED BY A VERY POWERFUL WOMAN A LOT OF MEN HAVE THAT AND I TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE MOST POWERFUL MEN N HISTORY JULIUS CAESAR MARK ANTONY A JO DE MAGIO WHO ALL THESE MEN VERY MASCULINE MEN WHO FALLEN FOR VERY FEMININE SIREN LIKE WOMEN AND BEEN COMPLETELY DOMINATED BY THEM AND THEY ACTUALLY KIND OF ENJOY THE PROCESS COUS ITS LIKE A SENSE OF I CAN LET GO I CAN ENTER THIS TOTALLY SUCH SENSUAL PHYSICAL WORLD AND IT'S IT'S EXTREMELY PLEASING IT'S LIKE ANOTHER REALM OUTSIDE OF MY KIND OF COLD MASCULINE WORLD YOU KNOW SO I DON'T REALLY GET MEN COMPLAINING TOO MUCH ABOUT WOMEN WHO SEDUCE THEM HONESTLY IT'S USUALLY THE OTHER WAY ROUND I LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND THANK OUR SPONSOR INSIDE TRACKER INSIDE TRACKER IS

GO TO INSIDE TRACKER DOC CALM SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET TWENTY PER CENT OFF ANY OF INSIDE TRACKERS PLANS AGAIN THAT INSIDE TRACKER DOC CAM SLASH HUMORMAN I'VE HEARD BEFORE UM AND I PROMISES IS NOT AN ORIGINAL IDEA THAT I 'M PRETENDING TO HAVE HEARD ELSEWHERE THAT MY FRIEND ASKED ME TO ASK SORT OF QUESTION THAT IN ALL SEXUAL EXCHANGES THERE'S A POWER EXCHANGE EVENLY UM MAYBE COULD ELABORATE ON THAT U BECAUSE AS YOU WERE DESCRIBING SOME OF THE SEDUCTIVE POWER DYNAMICS THAT EXIST A PHRASE THAT I'VE HEARD BEFORE I CAME TO MIND UM THAT AT FIRST MADE ME CHUCKLE BUT THEN MADE ME THINK UM QUITE DEEPLY ABOUT THIS ISSUE OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SEXUAL AND POWER DYNAMICS WHICH IS THIS NOTION OF TOPPING FROM THE BOTTOM YOU KNOW IF ONE IS GIVING SOME ONE ELSE THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY ARE MORE POWERFUL BY VIRTUE OF THE WORD GIVING THEY ACTUALLY HOLD SOME POWER RIGHT POWER IS CAN BE GIVEN OR TAKEN BUT UM OFTENTIMES A SEDUCTIVE EXCHANGES AND SEXUAL EXCHANGES IN ROMANTIC EXCHANGES IN PARTICULAR ARE ABOUT BOTH PEOPLE A BUYING INTO A THE LU A TEMPORARY ILLUSION LET'S PRETEND THAT YOU'RE IN CHARGE WHEN ACTUALLY I'M IN CHARGE OQE BUT I KNOW THAT YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE IN CHARGE OKELLETS JUST PRETEND NONE OF THAT EXISTS AND GJUST DO EXTS RIGHT AND I THINK THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF COVERT CONTRACTS AND IT'S ONE THAT ACTUALLY CAN PEDENTIALLY CREATE A LOT OF PROBLEMS POSTHALC RIGHT UM BUT I THINK THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SEX ROMANCE AND POWER IS AN IMPORDINARY TO EXPLORE IN THE CONTEXT OF THUS WELL I WROTE THE ART OF SEDUCTION WITH THE IDEA THAT IT WAS AN ART INVENTED BY WOMEN IT WAS INVENTED BY WOMEN WHO HAD NO POWER ESSENTIALLY SOCIALLY POLITICALLY IN ANY SENSE OF THE WORD IINDOMESTICALLY RIGHT AND BUT THE ONE POWER THAT THEY COULD THAT THEY COULD WIELD OVER A MAN WAS THROUGH SECTS SOME PHYSICAL ATTRACTION AND SO THEY DEVELOPED THIS ART OF KIND OF LURING A MAN INTO THEIR WORLD THROUGH VARIOUS THEATRICAL EFFECTS CLEOPATRA BEING KIND OF THE ARCHITYPE OF THIS AND THEN LURING THE POWERFUL MAN INTO THIS WORLD HE HAS THE ILLUSION THAT HE'S THE ONE PURSUING HER BUT IN FACT SHE IS THE ONE CONTROLLING THE DYNAMIC SO OFTENTIMES THE PERSON WHO APPEARS TO BE THE WEAKER ONE IN THE RELATIONSHIP WHO'S NOT DOING THE PURSUING IS ACTUALLY INVITING THE PURSUING IS ACTUALLY LEADING THE OTHER PERSON ON SO THERE'S A LOT OF KIND OF APPEARANCE GAMES GOING ON AND YOU CAN NEVER REALLY FIGURE OUT WHO EXACTLY IS IN CONTROL OF THE DYNAMIC CAUSE ONE PERSON IS LIKE ALLOWING THE OTHER PERSON TO LEAD THEM ON BUT THE FACT THAT YOU'RE ALLOWING THEM IS A DEGREE OF POWERS A DEGREE OF CONTROL RIGHT SO IT'S VERY HARD TO FIGURE OUT AND SECT IN POWER AND ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS ARE VERY MUCH INTERTWINED IN US PHYSICALLY EMOTIONALLY NEUROLOGICALLY YOU CAN AVOID IT RIGHT AND SO I THINK IT'S KIND OF DISHONEST TO SAY THAT THAT NONE OF THAT EXISTS THAT IT'S LIKE THAT THERE'S SOME E GALITARIAN PARADISE OUT OF THERE WHEN IT ITS REALLY NOT WIRDE IN US FOR THAT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP THERE'S A RECENT SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATION SLASH FACT TOY THAT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU IN THIS CONTEXT SLED LIKE YOUR THOUGHTS ON IT A DAVID ANDERSON WHO'S A PHENOMENAL NEURBILE JUST HE HAS BEEN A GUEST ON THIS POTCAST BEFORE HE'S A PROFESSOR AT CALTAC STUDIES PASICALLY THE FUNCTIONS OF THE HYPOTHALMAS O THINGS LIKE A AGGRESSION MATING AND THINGS OF THAT SORT AND DOES IT SO IT WITH GREAT DETAIL IS A VIRTUE OR SO OF THE HYPOTHELMAS AND HE POISHED A PAPER TWO YEARS AGO SHOWING THAT INDEED THERE ARE NEURL CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN OF ANIMALS AND PRESUMABLY IN HUMANS AS WELL THAT CONTROL SEXUAL MOUNTING BEHAVIOR BUT THAT THERE IS ACTUALLY A SEPARATE CIRCUIT FOR PURELY NONSEXUAL MOUNTING AND PHYSICAL POWER OVER THAT'S EXPRESSED IN ANIMALS AND ANYONE THAT'S EVER OWNED A DOG AND GONE TO THE DOG PARK WE'LL SEE SAME SEX MOUNTING BETWEEN DOGS OR MOUNTING BETWEEN DOGS THAT HAS APPARENTLY AM NO SEXUAL AND POINT AND IN EXPLORING THIS LITERATURE AND SOME TALKING TO DAVID ABOUT IT I'S VERY CLEAR THAT THEI'RE NORL CIRCUITS AM THAT HAVE EVERYTHING TO DO WITH SENTUALY ONE ANIMAL OF A SPECIES GETTING ON TOP OF THE OTHER ANIMAL USUALLY FROM BEHIND OFTENTIMES SCRUFFING OR BITING THE BACK OF THE NECK AND SAYING I CONTROL YOU IT'S T IT'S OFTEN DONE IN A PLAYFUL CONTEXT ESPECIALLY BETWEEN ANIMALS NOT ALWAYS AGGRESSIVE BUT THERE'S A CERTAIN ELEMENT OF PROGRESSIVE TO IT BUT IT IS SENTIALY SAYS I DECIDE WHETHEROR NOT YOU ARE MOBILE OR NOT FOR THIS MOMENT AND THAT IT AND TIS IS VERY IMPORTANT ONE EMPHASIES THIS IS A CIRCUIT THAT IS ENTIRELY SEPARATE FROM ALL OF THE REFLEXES ASSOCIATE WITH SEXUAL BEHAVIOR IN MALES AND FEMALES I FIND THIS TO BE FASCINATING A AND BECAUSE WE HEARE ABOUT POWER OVER WRIT AND WE HERE ABOUT POWER AND WE THINK ABOUT PHYSICAL POWER OVER BUT THE IDEA THAT SOMETHING AS PRIMITIVE AS MOUNTING JUST LIKE SOMETHING AS PRIMITIVE AS BITING OR AS STRIKING HAS ITS OWN UNIQUE SET OF CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN I THINK SUBSTANTIATES BEVER EVERYTHING THAT YOU PUT IN A IN YOUR BOOKS ABOUT POWER AND MAYBEVEN SEDUCTION AS WELL SO AS I JUST CANNOT TOSS THAT OUT THERE FOR CONSIDERATION I I I WONDER UM IF YOU HAVE ANY REFLECTIONS ON IT IF NOT A'M FEEL FREE TO JUST SAY I DON'T BUT OF COURSE BUT TO ME THIS WAS A REALLY IMPORTANT DISCOVERY BECAUSE I THINK EVERYONE LOOKS AT MOUNTING BEHAVIOR AND SAYS OH THAT HAS TO BE SEXUAL AND SOMETIMES ITS I YUBUT BUT IT'S NOT THAT THERE'S A THERE SEEM TO BE A HOST OF NURL CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN THAT ARE AR REALLY ABOUT DEFINING WHO'S ON TOP LITERALLY  HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SEX YE I'M SURE THI SHRUD EVOR I'VE NEVER I'V NEVER READ ANYTHING ABOUT THAT BUT I CAN SAY THAT U I WROTE A CHAPTER IN IN MY NEW BOOK ABOUT LOVE AND THAT'S A DIFFERENT THING THAN THAN SEDUCTION AND I WAS TRYING TO COME UP WITH AN IDEA OF LOVE THAT DOES HAVE AN ELEMENT OF EQUALITY THAT DOESN'T HAVE THIS POWER DYNAMIC GOING ON IN IT ROTAL OF THET AND AM YOU KNOW KIND OF LIKE THE ANTITHESIS OF MY ART OF SEDUCTION WHERE IAM ALMOST CONTRADICTING MYSELF AND I WAS GOING INTO THE INTO THE BIOLOGY OF ITAN EVEN INTO THE PHYSICS OF IT SO THERE IS A FAMOUS A FRENCH BIOLOGIST WHOSE NAME ESCAPES ME SORY I CAN'T REMEMBER FROM THE TWENTIES AND THIRTIES A AND HE WAS STUDYING PARAMESIUM AND HE'S FOUND THAT HE WAS STUDING THEM EOTHETEIN THESE PAWNS ET CETERA AND HE SAID THAT THEYE WAS THESE MOMENTS WHERE THESE SINGLE SELLED ORGANISMS WERE SUDDENLY COUPLING THEY WERE ALL JOINING TOGETHER JUST ONE TO ONE AND THEY WERE ABSORBING THE MEMBRANE OF ONE INSIDE THE OTHER AND THEN THEY WOULD LIKE GOTH IN ONCE ONE COUPLE TO THAT ALL THE PARAMESSIEEMS STARTED JOINING UP TOGETHER THAN THEY WOULD SINK TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PAWN AND PARAMESIUM DON'T REPRODUCE THROUGH SECS THEY REPRODUCE THROUGH DIVIDING THEMSELVES RIGHT SELF REPRODUCTION AND SO HE WAS SAYING THAT THE DESIRE TO COUPLE TO TO TO CONNECT TO SOME ONE SO DEEPLY WHERE YOU ABSORB ONE IS ABSORBED IN THE OTHER IS BIOLOGICALLY WIRED INTO US GOES BACK MILLIONS AN MILLIONS AN MILLIONS OF YEARS AND IT'S A DESIRE ESSENTIALLY A BIOLOGICAL DESIRE FOR LOVE RIGHT AND IT'S AN ENERGY THAT PERMEATES ALL ALLIT'S IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT POWER AND HIERARCHIES AND THAT HE WAS SHOWING OTHER CREATURES THAT HAD SOMETHING SIMILAR GOING ON AND YOU KNOWING PHYSICS WE TALK ABOUT ENTANGLEMENT AND WE ALSO TALK ABOUT ON YOU KNOW MATTER IF MATTER IS 'T BSISTAM OPPOSED BY A LOT OF CONNECT ENERGY IT JOINS TOGETHER I MEAN PARTICLES JOIN TOGETHER TO FORM MATTER ET CETER ET CETERA SO THERE'S SOMETHING IN THE UNIVERSE THAT'S TRYING TO CONNECT THINGS TO EACH OTHER SO THEREIS IS THIS KIND OF ENERGY THAT EXISTS IN THE WORLD WHERE WE HAVE A DEEP NEED TO CONNECT TO SOMEBODY WITH OUTSIDE OF THOSE POWER DYNAMICS RIGHT WHERE THERE IS A DEGREE OF EQUALITY WHERE WE'RE DRAWN TO EACH OTHER ND WE LET GO OF THE EGO GAMES WE LET GO OF THE PLAYING WE KIND OF SURMOUNT OUR OWN TIS THEOLOGY OUR OWN HYPOTHALMUS AND WE ENGAGE IN THIS I CALL IT LOVE SUBLIME AND IT INVOLVES THE PHYSICAL PART THE SEXUAL PART IS THE TRIGGER FOR IT BECAUSE WHEN WOU HAVE SEX WITH SOME ONE YOUR BODY IS SUDDENLY PERMEABLE TO THEIR ENERGY IN A WAY THAT YOU CANNOT CONTROL IT IT RELEASES ALL KINDS OF OF CHEMICALS IN THE BRAIN THAT ARE VERY POWERFUL AND OFTENTIMES THAT SENSE IS A TOO POWERFUL AND YOU REACT AND YOU'RE AFRAID OF IT AND YOU PULL BACK BUT IF YOU DON'T REACT AND YOU GO FURTHER THAN THE MIND ALSO BECOMES PERMEABLE TO THE OTHER PERSON AND THEIR ENERGY AND THEIR DESIRE AND SO THEN IT CONCREATES A SPIRALLING EFFECT WERE THE PHYSICAL AND THE MENTAL CONNECTION REACHES THE STATE THAT I CALL LOVE SUBLIME NOW IT'S AN IDEAL IT DOESN'T REALLY EXIST THAT MUCH OUT THERE IN THE WORLD TO DAY BUT THERE AR E STORIES IN HISTORY THAT ILLUSTRATED AND I BELIEVE THAT IS A BIOLOGICAL NECESSITY FOR US TO FEEL A DEEP DEEP SENSE OF CONNECTION WE NORMALLY ASCRIBE THAT TO RELIGION TO GOD ET CETERA BUT I MAINTAIN THE ESSENCE OF LOVE THE MODEL FOR IT FOR LOVE IS BETWEEN TWO HUMAN BEINGS STRAIGHT OR HOMOSEXUAL DOESN'T MATTER AND THAT FEELING OF SURMOUNTING OUR OWN NOURALOGY OUR OWN SYSTEM AND AN ENTERING THE ZOWN IS DEEPLY DEEPLY SATISFING WE ALL WANTED AND IT HAS TO INVOLVE LETTING GO OF THE POWER DYNAMICS LETTING AND EVERYTHING BEING EQUAL I'S NOT TAT THE OTHER PERSON IS EXACTLY LIKE YOU YOU RECOGNIZE THEIR DIFFERENCE BUT BUT AS FAR AS BEING WORTHY OF ATTENTION BEING WORTHY AND RESPECTED YOU LEAVE ALL THAT OTHER STEFF OUTSIDE SO THERE IS A ZON THAT'S POSSIBLE THAT'S OUTSIDE THIS POWER DYNOW T THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT I'M EXCITED THAT YOURE WRITING ABOUT THIS SO THIS IS FOR YOUR NEXT BOOK YE I'M VERY EXCITED I COULDN'T HELP BUT THINK OF SOME OF THE PARALLELS BETWEEN WHAT YOU DESCRIBE AND WHAT WE'RE OBSERVING NOWADAYS IN THE LANDSCAPE OF POLITICS AND SOCIAL DYNAMICS WHERE CLEARLY AM THERE IS NO SETTING ASIDE OF EGOIST PEOPLE FEEL IT BOTH SIDES FEEL ATTACKED EVERYONE AND BETWEEN FEELS CONFUSE LIKE WHY DO I HAVE TO PICK ASIDE AM AND THERE SEEMS TO BE NO HINT OF A FUTURE WHERE PEOPLE ARE SETTING DOWN THEIR SWORDS I WHICH MEANS IF WE WERE TO GO WITH YOUR EARLIER DEFINITION WHICH I LIKE A LOT THAT A'M NOBODY FEELS SAFE ENOUGH TO BE VULNERABLE ENOUGH TO A TO ALLOW THE UNION OF OF PEOPLE TO OCCUR WHICH IS JUST A  O WAY OF REWORDING YOU KNOW A BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS M AND NOT NEARLY AS ELOQUENTLY AS AS YOU DESCRIBED IT BUT IF SETTING ASIDE OF POWER DYNAMICS AND MAKING ONESELF VULNERABLES IS THE KEY TO ACCESS ING LOVE IN THE ROMANTIC CONTACTS SURELY BUT ALSO IN THE AM SOCITAL CONTECT MEAN WHAT ARE THE CHANNELS FOR THAT I MEAN I SUPPOSE THERE IS THE ARGUMENT NOT MINE THAT EVERYONE SHOULD JUST TAKE A BOATLOAT OF PSYCHODELICS AND SEE THE INTERCONNECTEDNESS OF THINGS BUT THAT SEEMS LIKE AN UNREALISTIC ROUT I AD JUST DON'T SEE THAT BEING OUN O A YOU KNOW TWELFTH GREAT GRADUATION AM C RICULUM UM NOR DO I THINK IT WOULD BE HEALTHY I TO BE CLEAR I THINK THAT YOUD WE DEND UP WITH A LOT OF EXPRESSION OF OF PROBLEMS THERE UM BUT SHORT OF A MAGIC SUBSTANCE THAT COULD INCREASE FEELINGS OF A CONNECTEDNESS AMONG EVERYONE SIMULTANEOUSLY UM HOWR YEU GEN A SAVE HUMANITY ROBERT WELL  CAUSE IM I'M CONCERNED ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR WITH HOOK UP CULTURE WITH PORNOGRAPHY ET CETERA ET CETERA IT'S KIND OF REWIRING THE HUMAN BRAIN AND WERE LOSING WHAT I WAS JUST DESCRIBING AND I SEE OPRTICLY A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE AND I DON'T BLAME THEM BECAUSE THEY'VE GROWN UP IN THE WORLD THAT'S VERY CHAOTIC AND VERY HOSTILE COUDIC COULD I SAY I THINK IT'S AND NOT TO BE NIPPICKY HERE BUT I I LOVE WHAT YOU JUST SAID THEY IN MY MIND IT'S HIGH THINGS LIKE THAT ARE HIGH JACKING THE HARD WIRING OF THE BRAIN O   AND I YOU ITOUS O I NO O  NO I GAN TORORGIVE ME MY THE EYES IS FOLLY GOING  I REALLY REAY WIRE THE BRAIN LIKE THAT I THINK WE CAN EXPAND AND REWIRE UPON OUR HARD WIRING BUT SO MUCH OF WHAT YOU YOU TALK ABOUT IN YOUR BOOKS IS ABOUT FINDING ONE'S ESSENCE BUT THEN ALSO WHAT I LOVE ABOUT YOUR BOOKS SO MUCH MANY OTHER THINGS IS THAT IT'S ABOUT THAT DANCE BETWEEN THE HARD WIRING AND AND THE POSSIBLE OF THROUGH EFFORTS SO ANYWAY FORGIVE ME FOR ER O O ONERT THAT'S VERY AFTERAT A U SO YEAT WHOW DO YOU GET US OUT OF THIS WEL IF YOU'RE PUTTING A BIG BURDEN ON ME A BUT I THINK GOT UP TO IT AWEL I TRY TO DO IT IN THIS CHAPTER BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEDUCE THE READER INTO THE IDEA THAT THIS IS SOMETHING EXTREMELY PLEASURABLE AND EXTREMELY HEALTHY AND THE FEELING OF BEING VULNERABLE IS A VERY POSITIVE ATTRIBUTE THAT WILL INFECT NOT JUST YOUR ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS BUT WILL INFECT YOU MENTALLY SO CREATIVE PEOPLE ARE EXTREMELY VULNERABLE THEY'RE EXTREMELY VULNERABLE TO IDEAS THEY'RE EXTREMELY VULNERABLE TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND CLOSING YOURSELF OFF INTO YOUR OWN EGO INTO YOURSELFS OF THE CHAPTERIS CALLED ESCAPE THE PR ISON OF THE EGO AND YOUR TINE OF TRAPPED INSIDE OF YOURSELF AND YOUR OWN THOUGHTS AND YOUR OWN DESIRGE IT IS LIKE A PRISONERS INCLOSING YOU WHEN YOU WANT O ESCAPE SOMEHOW AND YOU ESCAPE THROUGH DRUGS YOU ESCAPE THROUGH PORRN BUT IT DOESN'T LEAD TO ACTUALLY ESCAPING YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO LET GO OF THE SELF AND GET OUT OF THI THIS PRISON THAT YOU'RE IN RIGHT AND SO IT'S A DESIRE THAT THAT WE ALL HAVE AND SO I WANTED TO FRAME IT AS THIS NCREDIBLY POSITIVE DYNAMIC THAT YOU CAN ENGAGE IN AND THE ABILITY TO BE VULNERABLE TO OTHER PEOPLE TO OPEN YOURSELF UP AND TO SAY THAT YET THEY MIGHT HURT ME BUT I'M STRONG ENOUGH TO TAKE IT AND IF THEY HURT ME I'LL LEARN FROM IT AND I'LL REBOUND AND I KNOW THAT' A BIT NAIVE ON MY PART BUT I WANT YOU TOT LEAST HAVE THAT FEELING BECAUSE A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE RITE TO ME AND THE ESAY I I CAN'T FALL IN LOVE ANY MORE I CAN'T I DON'T LIKE THAT FEELING I'VE T MAKES THE LOSS OF CONTROLS TOO MUCH YOU KNOW AND AND A LOT OF THAT THEIR BEHAVIOUR PATERNS ARE IN CREATING THIS SENSE OF CONTROL WHICH YOU CAN HAVE WHEN YOU'RE LOCKED INSIDE OF YOURSELF A HENCE OVER INDULGENCE IN PORONOGRAPHY YE AND MASTURBATION ET CETERA A AS A WAY TO AVOID THE YOU KNOW THE UNDERSTANDABLE FEAR ABOUT INTERRATION RELATIONAL DYNAMICS YE Y SO YOU KNOW WHEN YOUR YOUNG YOYOUR IDEALISTIC OR LEAST A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE AND YOU HAVE THESE DREAMS AND THESE HOPES AND TO LET GO OF THIS POSSIBILITY WHICH IS DEEPLY PLEASURABLE AND DEEPLY THERAPEUTIC TO THE HUMAN ANIMAL AS A SOCIAL ANIMAL IS LIKE THE HIGHEST FORM OF INTERACTION THAT WE CAN HAVE SO MY STRATEGY IN THAT CHAPTER WAS TO PAINT SUCH A WONDERFUL PORTRAYAL OF THE PLEASURES THAT ARE AWAITING YOU BY LETTING GO OF YOUR DEFENCES OF LETTING GO OF ALL OF YOUR NATURAL RESISTANCE FACTORS AND OPENING YOURSELF UP TO OTHER PEOPLE IS IS AT HE TO NOT JUST A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP BUT TO CAREER SUCCESS TO MENTAL ENERGY TO CREATIVITY TO BEING OPEN IN GENERAL RIGHT AND SO I DON'T THINK I COULD HAVE A WY YOU KNOW A HUGE IMPACT BUT WILL SEE WHEN WHEN THE BOOK COMES OUT BUT I'M ADVOCATING THAT SENSE OF OPENING YOURSELF UP TO THE UNIVERSE TO THE CAUSE MOST ITSELF AS AN ENERGY THAT PERMEATES THE WORLD AND SO THAT YOU DON'T WANT O THE FEELING OF BEING CLOSED INSIDE OF YOUR EGO INSIDE OF YOUR YOURSELF I WANT TO MAKE IT SO YOU FEEL THE PAIN OF THAT BECAUSE YOU DON'T REALLY FEEL THE PAIN OF IT YOU FEEL LIKE ITS COMFORTABLE FOR YOU BUT I WANT TO MAKE A CLERITY THAT IT'S NOT COMFORTABLE ITS DEEPLY DEEPLY PAINFUL AND ITS DISCONNECTING YOU FROM SOME OF THE BEST EXPERIENCES YOU CAN HAVE IN LIFE SO I HAVE THAT STRATEGY THE ONLY OTHER HOPE I HAVE IS IN THE HUMAN SPIRIT ITSELF SO A LOT OF THIS IS BEING CAUSED BY SOCIAL MEDIA I BELIEVE RIGHT A AND AND THE INSTANT AND THE KIND OF IMMEDIATE GRATIFICATION WE CAN GET IN SO MANY WAYS AND MY HOPE IS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE GET FET UP AND GET DISDISDISGUSTED WITH ALL THIS DISCONNECTION AND ALIENATION IN THEIR LIFE AND THAT THEY HUNGER FROM ACTUALLY SOMETHING MORE COMMUNAL MORE INTERACTIVE MORE REAL I AS SUPPOSED TO VIRTUAL AND SO THAT THE HUMAN SPIRIT CAN'T BE COMPLETELY SQUASHED LIKE TECHNOLOGY ET CETERA SO I HAVE THAT HOPE BECAUSE WE'VE GONE THROUGH THESE CYCLES BEFOREIGN HISTORY WHERE PEOPLE HAVE BECOME VERY INVULNERABLE AND VERY LOCKED AND CLOSED AND SUDDENLY THERE IS AN EXPLOSION A CREATIVE EXPLOSION LIKE IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES LIKE IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES LIKE AN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY EUROPE WITH THE CASINOVE IN THE WHERE SEDUCTION REACHED ITS KIND OF APIGY ET CETERA SO IT HAS CON OF SWUNG BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THESE MOMENTS WHERE HUMAN'S GETTIN CREDIBLY CLOSED IN BITTER AND PARTISIN THEVERYTHING'S CONFLICT IN EVERYONE'S DEVICE ET CETERA AND SUDDENLY GOES IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION I I HAVE HOPE IN THAT POSSIBILITY AND I STRUCTURED MY CHAPTER TO PERHAPS SWEEP THAT A LITTLE BIT ALONG THAT TIME SEE IF I CAN HAVE ANY EFFECT I THINK WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED IN CONVERSATIONS LIKE IT IN THAT STEM FROM IT ARE LIKELY TO HAVE A TREMENDOUS EFFECT I THINK IT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S NEEDED NOW AND UM CERTAINLY I'LL BE I TO AMPLIFY THAT MESSAGE I I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING YOU SAID AND NOT JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE SITTING HERE IS A GES A ON THIS PODCAST BUT BECAUSE UM IT'S CLEAR TO ME THAT WHILE POWER DYNAMICS AND SEDUCTION ARE UM WIRED INTO OUR HUMAN RELATION SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME THAT WE HAVE REACHED IT AT A VERY CHALLENGING PERIOD IN OUR HISTORY U IT'S SOMEWHAT OF A RELIEF TO ME TO KNOW THAT IT'S HAPPENED BEFORE BUT IN A VERY LIFFERENT CONTEXT  WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT THE SWINGING BACK AND FORTH OF THE PENDULUM A SOMEONE IN FACT A PETER ATEA ON LINE A PHYSICIANS A BROTHER ACTUALLY SAID I UM SO WHALL CREDIT HIM HE SAID NO IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A PENDULUM THAT SWINGS BACK AND FORTH UNFORTUNATLY NOW IT'S BECOME A WRECKING BALL SO IT'S SWINGING BACK AND FORTH IN DOING DAMAGE AS IT AS IT REACHES ITS UM YOU KNOW IT IT'S EXTREME AND I THINK THAT UM I ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO A TIME WHERE PEOPLE  ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE INJUSTICE IS AROUND THEM AND AND THAT HAVE BEEN DONE TO THEM AND OTHERS AND  BUT SOMEHOW ARE ABLE TO TRANSCEND THAT AND THE WORD THAT I' LIKE TO PICK UP ON THERE IS THE WORD JUSTICE U IT WAS POINTED OUT TO ME A BY SOME ONE I RESPECT VERY MUCH THAT YOU KNOW HAVING A SENSE OF JUSTICE AS IT IS A WONDERFUL AND IMPORTANT THING AND AS HUMANS IT'S IMPORTANT TO HOW WE STRUCTURE SOCIETY BUT I DO THINK THAT A LOT OF THE NEGATIVE THINGS THAT WE SEE OUT THERE NOWADAYS ARE HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE AVAILABILITY OF A READY AVAILABILITY OF PORNOGRAPH HE HI DEN CITY CALLORY FOOD ET CETERA A BUNCH OF THINGS LIKE THAT BUT THAT ONE OF THE ISSUES WITH SOCIAL MEDIA CAUSE IT DOES HAVE ITS POSITIVE ASPECTS BUT ONE OF THE NEGATIVE ISSUES IN MY MIND IS THAT IT'S A STEADY FLOW OF AM EXAMPLES OF INJUSTICE SO ALL DAY LONG YOU'RE TUS SEEING THINGS LIKE THAT THAT PISTS YOU OFF AND THAT PISTS OTHER PEOPLE OFF AND FOR DIFFERENT REASONS BUT BUT WHAT WAS POINTED OUT TO ME IS THAT ONE OF THE KEY THINGS ABOUT A SENSE OF INJUSTICE IS TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER ORE NOT THERE'S ANYTHING THAT YOU SHOULD DO ABOUT IT AND I THINK THAT EVERYONE NOW FEELS A BIT HIGH JACKED BY ALL THE INJUSTICE AS WE SEE BECAUSE WE FEEL LIKE WWERE SUPPOSE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT BUT IT MAY BE THAT WHILE WE CAN'T LET EVERY INJUSTICE PASS THAT BEING BOMBARDED ALL DAY LONG WITH THINGS THAT UPSET US IS HIGH JACKING OUR CREATIVITY IT'S DISTRACTING US FROM OUR DEEPER PURPOSE IT'S PREVENTING A SENSE OF VULNOBILITY THAT WOULD LEAD TO A SENSE OF DEEP LOVE AND ON AND ON SO I DON'T THINK IT'S JUST ABOUT THE THE LURE THE TENTALIZING LURERS OF OF SEX FOOD AND UM AND LOOKING AT YOU KNOW BODY IS IN HEARING VOICES ON SOCIAL MEDYA I THINK THERE IS OME VALIDITY THAT BUT THAT IT'S ALSO THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S JUST AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO GO DOWN THE GRAVITATIONAL PULL FORCES OF INJUSTICE LIKE AH THAT'S SO FRESTRING WHY ARE THEY DOING THAT A MAN CATCH MYSELF DOING THAT TALKING TO CO WORKERS WHEN I WALKED IN ABOUT DID YOU SEE THS THING THIS IS CRAZY WHAT'S GOING ON WITH A THEY ARE CRAZY WHEN YOU KNOW AS OPPOSED TO THINKING ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE IN THAT MOMENT AND I TRY IN YANK MYSELF OUT OF THAT BUT I I THINK THAT A YOU'RE NOT CAN DO IT ALONE BUT I THINK YOU WILL PLAY OF MAJOR ROLAND SAVING US FROM THIS BECAUSE PEOPLE I DO I THINK BECAUSE PEOPLE JUST NEED TO SEE THEMSELVES THROUGH A DIFFERENT LENS AND REALIZE THIS IS DISTRACT ME FROM WHOM I'M SUPPOSED TO BE WELL A LOT OF WHAT WHAT MODERN LIFE SHOULD INVOLVE IS THE BILL TO IGNORE CERTAIN THINGS SO FOR INSTANCE I DORKNOW YOU KNOW THA HAP NEXT DOOR OH RIGHT I USED TO HAVE IT BUT THEN I SEE ALL THAT THE PACKAGES BEING STOLEN OFF MY NEIGHBOUR'S CRURCHES IN OAKLAND AND THEN I STARTED ENJOYING LIVING IN OAKLYN LESS AND I LOVE THE CITY OF OAKLAND  GOT IT'S PROBLEMS I KNOW I HAS IS DRAMS BUT AS AN EAS PAKE IT YOU KNOW AND WHEN TO SCHOOL OUT THERE AND YOU KNOW LIKE I HAVE DEEP LOVE FOR THE EAST BAY IN IT 'S ALWAYS HAD THOSE PROMIS BUT WHEN YOU SEE STUFF BEING STOLEN ON YOUR PHOLEN IN THE MILL THE NIGHT WHEN YOU WAKE UP IT CREATES A SENSE THAT LIKE THEY'RE OUT TO GET MY STUFF RIGH TERRIBLE RIGHT AND SO I HAVE IT IN MY SPAM FILTER BUT I LOOK AT IT AND AND EVERY HEADLINE IS PEOPLE STEALING SOMEBODY BROKE INTO SOMEBODY'S HOUSE THIS PERS DOG BID ME THIS IS RABID DOGLIN REN THERE'S THIS HOMELESS PERSON THAT'S YELLING AND ATTACKING PEOPLE HON OR ONOR NON I FEEL LIKE I'M LIVING IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD IT'S LIKE BEROOD OR SOMETHING IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES I CAN'T EVEN WALK OUT MY DOOR I JUST GOT I DON'T LOOK AT NEXT DOOR ANY MORE I JUST IGNORE IT I DON'T OPEN IT EVER BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THAT THEY DESIGN ALGARYTHMICALLY TO PUT THAT IN FRONT OF YOU EVERY SINGLE TIME SO THAT YOU CLICK ON IT BECAUSE THAT'S HWE RESPOND TO THAT KIND OF STUFF NATUALLY WE CAN'T HELP IT SO YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SHUT THAT STUFF UP AND LOOK AT WHAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY CONTROL IN YOUR LIFE SO I'VE HAVE THIS VICERAL DISLIKE OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOU CRANE BECAUSE I WAS IN YOU CRANE RECENTLY AND I FEEL I'F I DENTIFIED VERY STRONGLY WITH THEIR STRUGGLE RIGHT AND IT JUST I CAN'T THAT OUTRAGE FEELING JUST EVERY TIME I READ AN ARTICLE ABOUT IT IT JUST TRIVES ME CRAZY SO THE ONLY THINGS I STOP READING AS MUCH AS I CAN I READ THINGS THAT ARE KIND OF RATIONAL AND AND INTELLIGENT AND I SEND THE MONEY AND I YOU KNOW I DON'T AT AS MUCH AS I CAN AND I HELP THEM PRACTICALLY BUT I DON'T ALLOW MYSELF TO GET THAT KIND OF OUTRAGED FEELING ALL THE TIME SO SOMEBODY HAS TO WRIDE A BOOK SOMEBODY HAS TO INSTRUCT US AND WHAT TO IGNORE IND WHAT TO ACTUALLY PAY ATTENTION TO SO THERE ARE THINGS THAT YOU CAN CONTROL INJUSTICEIS THATTER OUT THERE THAT YOU COULD CONTROL BY VOTING BY CERTAIN BY AMASSING A MOVEMENT BY IN NO DEALING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE NOT BY TRYING TO RECYCLE EVERY LITTLE THING IN YOUR HOUSE BUT ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING REALLY MUCH MORE MACKERO IN THE WORLD YOU KNO JOINING A CAUSE THERE ARE THINGS YOU CAN DO AND THAT'S POSITIVE AND THAT'S A WAY OF CHANNELING THAT KIND OF DARK ENERGY IN YOU FOR A POSITIVE PURPOSE BUT IT'S TOTALLY DISRUPTIVE AND IT TOTALLY DISTRACT YOU AND WEAKENS YOU AND DRAINS YOU OF ENERGY TO FALL INTO THOSE RABBIT HOLES AND LET THEM AND LET YOURSELF FALL INTO THEM SO YOU HAVE TO LEARN THE ART OF WHAT TO IGNORE AND WHAT NOT TO PAY ATTENTION TO AN UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE WIRED TO SEE THOSE KIND OF RED ALERT BUTTONS ON FACE BOOK OR ON NEXT DOOR WHEREVER THEY ARE AND IT IT'S JUST IT'S ITS NEGATIVE IT'S LIKE A CANDY RUSH YOU HAVE TO AVOID IT AND IT'S TAKING US AWAY FROM OUR PURPOSE WHICH WE EACH HAVE I MANTINK TO ME THAT'S THAT THAN MOST UM DIL TEARS ASKED UNLESS UNLESS YOUR PURPOSE IS TO ORGANIZE AND BE AN ACTIVIST PEOPLE ASK ME I WROTE A LOT ABOUT IN MY HUMAN NATURE BOOK ABOUT THE SHADOW SIDE OF HUMAN NATURE RIGHT AND WE ALL HAVE AT WE ALL HAVE A DARK SIDE WE ALL HAVE HIDDEN AGGRESSION WE ALL THE FEELINGS OF ENVY WE ALL HAVE FEELINGS OF GRANDIOSITY WE ALL HAVE AGGRESSIVE IMPULSES HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH IT AND I SAY THE WAY DEALIS TO CHANNEL IT INTO SOMETHING POSITIVE AND PRO SOCIAL AND THAT CAN BE PUTTING IT IN YOUR ART WORK VENTING THAT ANGER IN THAT OUTRAGE IN SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE KIND OF CAN IDENTIFY WITH OR IT CN BE AN ORGANIZING SOMETHING THAT COULD BE YOUR PURPOSE IN LIFE AND ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING POSITIVE SO THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY USE THAT ENERGY FOR SOME KIND OF ACTUAL LIFE'S TASK OR PURPOSE YOU DISCUSSING LATELY A BIT ON SOME OF YOUR CHANNELS ABOUT MASCULININE FEMININE UM WHAT'S AY ROLES UM AND CRISES OF THE MASCULINE FEMININE DANCE AS WELL AS THE CRISIS OF MASCULINY PERSAY HE CRISIS OF FEMININN PERSAY UM DO YOU CARE TO EXPAND ON THAT A BIT I THINK U WE COULD PROBABLY TAKE THREE FOUR HOURS TO EXPLORE ALL THIS IN FULL UM BUT I WAS STRUCK BY SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU SAID UM BECAUSE I AGREE COMPLETELY THAT UM JUST AS WE ARE NOT GIVEN A ROAD MAP WHEN WE ARRIVE IN THE WORLD AS TO HOW TO FIND OUR PURPOSE I THINK THERE'S ALSO A VERY CONFLICTED ROAD MAP THAT'S THROWN IN FRONT OF US AND INDEED CONFLICTING MULTIBLE ROAD MAPS ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO BE MASCULINE OR FEMININE OR SOME COMMINATION OF BOTH WHICH OF COURSE EVERYBODY IS SOME COMMINATION OF BOTH JUST A VARYING DEGREES WELL UM YES SO MEN HAVE A FEMININE SIGHT TO THEM WHICH IF YOU TRY TO REPRESS IT WILL COME OUT IN OTHER WAYS AND WOMEN HAVE A MASCULINE SIDE TO THEM I THINK YOUNG DESCRIBED THIS VERY WELL WITH THE ONUMA AND THE ONUMUS WHICH I THINK IS IS EXTREMELY REAL U IT'S VERY VERY CONFUSING TIMES FOR BOTH MEN AND FOR WOMEN RIGHT NOW WE DON'T KNOW THE RULES THAT THAT THET THER EVERYTHING IS JUST SO FLUID AND IT'S VERY VERY DIFFICULTPARTICULARY IF YOURE YOUNG SO YOUNG WOMEN ARE GETTING THIS IDEA THAT EVERYTHING SHOULD BE EQUAL AND THAT WOMEN SHOULD HAVE AND OF COURSE IT'S RIGHT SHOULD IVE BE PAID THE SAME I SHOULD HAVE THE SAME CAREER OPPORTUNITIES THERE SHOULD BE NO PREJUDICE OR HARASSED AN OR ANYTHING BUT AT THE SAME TIME AUN SOCIAL MEDIATES ALL ABOUT LOOKING PERFECT AND LOOKS ARE ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT IF YOU'RE NOT HOT YOU'R IN TERRIBLE TROUBLE AND A LOT OF YOUNG GIRLS ARE EXTREMELY CONFUSED BY THIS THE'RE GETTING MIXED SIGNALS RIGHT AND BOYS ARE EVEN PERHAPS EVEN WORSE CIRCUMSTANCE WERE BEING MASCULINE IS SEEN AS SOMETHING NEGATIVE SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY IDEALS OUT THERE ANY MORE OF WHAT WHAT CO NSTITUTES A GOOD POSITIVE FORM OF FEMININITY AND A GOOD POSITIVE FORM OF MASCULINITY IN FACT WE EVEN THINK AT THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANYTHING LIKE THAT THERES NO SUCH THING AS BEING MASCULINE A FEMININE WHATEVER IT'S VERY VERY CONFUSING AND SO YOU KNOW I THINK OF OF OF MASCULINE TRAITS THAT I THINK OUR VERY POSITIVE ANTHAT SHOULD BE OUT THERE TO KIND OF COUNTER ACT THE SORT OF ANDREW TATE SEDUCTION THAT A LOT OF YOUNG MEN ARE FALLING FOR AND IT'S A KIND OF AN INNER STRAINTH WHERE YOUR SORT OF INCONTROL OF YOUR EMOTIONS YOU'RE NOT INVULNERABLE ET CETERA ET CETERA BUT AM YOU CAN TAKE CRITICISM YOU CAN TAKE P YOU KNOW YOU CAN HAVE MOMENTS OF FAILURE AND YOUR BOUNCE BACT BUT YOU HAVE A KIND OF RINNER RASILIANTS AND A KIND OF INNER STRAINTH A KIND OF A QUIET CALM THAT I THINK OU'S TO BE EXEMPLIFIED IN MOVY ICONS LIKE A GARRY COOPER TYPE THING RIGHT ND THAT KIND OF SENSE OF INNER CALMNESS WHERE YOU'RE NOT HYSTERICAL YOU'RE NOT GETTING UPSET ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE A KIND OF INNER STRENGTH AND A CONFIDENCE AND YOU CAN WITHSTAND KIND OF WHAT RHIN HOLIDAY TALKS ABOUT LOT ABOUT WITH STOICISM YOU CAN WITHSTAND ALL THE HARDSHIPS IN LIFE BUT YOU HAVE THAT CITADEL WITHIN YOU IS A VERY VERY POWERFUL FORM OF MASCULINITY AS OPPOSED TO IT'S ALL ABOUT SLEEPING WITH A LOT OF WOMEN HAVING REALLY FAST CARS YOU KNOW BEING ABUSIVE AND BEING A BULLY ET CETER ET CETERA THESE ARE SIGNS OF WEAKNESS OF INSECURITY AND TO BE MASCULINE SHOULD BE A SENSE OF SECURITY AND INNER CONFIDENCE AND INNER STRAINTH RIGHT AND THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD VENERATE IN OUR CULTURON WE SHOULD HAVE ICONTS LIKE THAT OQET A IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THAT THERE'S NO ROLL FOR MEN WHO ARE NOT MASCULINE OR WO HAVE MORE OF THE FEMININE VIRTUES THAT'S ALSO THIS DEFINITELY A ROLE FOR THAT AND YOU KNOW WE SEE A LOT OF THAT IN ALL SORTS OF AT A RENAS OF LIFE AND THEN THERE SHOULD BE A POSITIVE MODEL FOR WOMEN YOU KNOW WHERE INSTEAD OF THEIR APPEARANCES BEING JUDGED BY THEIR APPEARANCES IN HAVING TO CONFORM TO IDEALS OF WHAT'S HOD OR NOT IT'S ABOUT BEING AINCREDIBLY POWERFUL AND COMPETENT AND AND HAVE EXPERTES IN BEING REALLY SUCCESSFUL IN YOUR CAREER AND AND AS SUPPOSED TO BEEN CONTINUALLY JUDGED BY YOUR APPEARANCES WHICH IS VERY DAMAGING SO THESE ARE TERRIBLE TIMES I MEAN I I FEEL FORTUNATE THAT I GREW UP IN A TIME WHERE THERE WERE THESE KIND OF MODELS FOR ME TO GO BY AND I THINK OF MY FATHER WHO WHO WAS A VERY QUIET MAN AND HE WAS HE WAS JUST A MIDDLE CLASS SAILESMAN IS BASICALLY WHAT HE WAS HE JUST SOLD FOR ALL HIS WHOLE LIFE HE SOLD CHEMICAL SUPPLIES FOR ONE COMPANY BUT HE WAS VERY DIGNIFIED HE TREATED PEOPLE WELL HE WAS VERY COMM AND VERY QUIET BUT HE ALSO WAS VERY EMPATHETIC THAT WAS MY RULE MODEL FOR WHAT I THINK IS A GOOD MASCULINE ENERGY AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST DON'T HAVE THAT N THEIR VERY LOST AND SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IS THAT I CAN'T REALLY PRODUCE THAT OUT OF THIN AIR BUT I WISH I COULD CERTAINLY NOWADAYS THERE MANY MORE UN IT'S A EXAMPLES AND OPTIONS OF MASCULININE FEMININE QUALITIES OUT THERE FOR OBSERVATION BECAUSE OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND BECAUSE OF THE ENTERNET AND AS YOU POINT OUT BEFORE A KEY FEATURE TO BECOMING A FUNCTIONAL HUMAN BEING ESPECIALLY NOWDAYS AS LEARNING WHAT TO IGNORE THERE'S AN INTERESTING IDEA IN THE CIRCLES AROUND A NUTRITION IN HEALTH THAT YOU NEVER BEFORE IN HUMAN HISTORY HAVE HUMAN BEINGS BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS SUCH A WIDE VARIETY OF FOODS THAT ARE DIFFER FROM WHAT THEIR ANCESTORS AT AND I DON'T EVEN MEAN ANCIENT ANCESTORS I MEAN IF YOU GREW UP IN THE BAYAREA AS I DID IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES THERE WERE A FEW ETHNIC RESTAURANTS BUT WE ATE THE SAME YOU KNOW FIFTEEN OR TWENTY FOODS OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND THEN EVENTUALLY THAT EXPLODED INTO DOZENS OF OPTIONS IN MORE AND FUSION FOODS AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS AND SO THERE IS THIS IDEA IN THE NUTRICIAN COMMUNITIES THAT WE ARE NOT HARD WIRED TO A THINK ABOUT AND DISCERN SO MANY DIFFERENT FOOD OPTIONS THAT UUNO THAT'S A AND TO TASTE SO MANY DISTINCT FLAVORS WHEREAS BEFORE PEOPLE ONE PORTION THE PLANET OR COUNTRY ATE GENERALLY ONE WAY AN A GIVEN SEASON IF THERE SEASONALITY ET CETERA ET CETERA IN A SIMILAR VEIN A WE ARE NOW AND CHILDREN TOO ARE NOW A OVERWHELMED WITH THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS OF HOW TO EXPRESS ONESELF BOTH MASCULINYAN FEMININITY BUT A GENERALLY SPEAKING AND SO THE QUESTION IS THEN HOW DOES ONE CHOUSE RIGHT HOW DOES ONE DECIDE WHAT'S WHAT'S FUNCTIONAL WHAT WORKS WHAT'S BEST WHAT'S ME RIGHT EVERY ONE ASKING THEMSELVES WHO AM I RIGHT I THINK ALL TEA NAGERS I FIND THIS FASTING ASK THEMSELVES WHO AM I ADULTS DON'T TEND TO ASK THEMSELVES THAT QUESTION OT WHO AM I STILL O ELL THAT'S GOODI SHOULD ASK MYSELF THAT MORE OFTEN BUT AM I THINK THAT WE CLEARLY HAVE GONE OVER A CLIFF WITH THE STUFF I DON'T THINK WE ARE STILL AT THE POINT WHERE A WHAT KIND OF VEARING TOWARDS THE EDGE OF OF CONFUSION I THINK YOUNG PEOPLE ARE REALLY CONFUSED BECAUSE THE MOMENT ONE ASSUMES A ONE CLEAR AND LET SAY BALANCED MASK SAID OF MASCULINE FEMININE ATTRIBUTES OR MAYBE VIERS A BIT MORE MASCULINE AR BIT MORE FEMININE IT'S LIKE A THERE ARE MILLION EXAMPLES TELLING YOU THAT THAT'S WRONG IKNOW AND THEN SOMETIMES HAS THE TENDENS HY TO ANCHOR TO WELL KNOW NO I'M RIGHT BECAUSE THIS IS THIS IS WHO I AM AND THEN ALL A SUDDEN YOUR EAR N A LARGER BATTLE SO A YO GERRY COOPER'S GREAT LOVE HIS MOVIES A BUT WE'RE LIKE WE NOW HAVE A MILLION VARIATIONS ON GERRY COOPER A THAT DON'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE THE GARRY COOPER YOU AND I ARE TALKING ABOUT IN LOTO PEOPLE WHEN OVEN KNOW WHO WERE TALKING ABOUT I DON'T YOU O RAM I DAMVER NO A DINES I PERHAPS IT ILLUSTRATES THE POINT NO I'D NOT THAT YOUAR DYNASTORE BUT THAT  THERE IS NO SINGLE OR EVEN IM SAD OF MASCULINE OR FEMININE IDEALS IT WAS SO PICKING ROLL MODELS I SOMETHING THAT I REALLY TRULY INTERNALIZED FROM YOUR BOOK MASTERY YEYOU KNOW I THERE WERE A LOT OF LONELY YEARS FOR ME AND I WON'T GET INTO THE STORIES OF DISTWONDERING LIKE WHY WHAT 'M I INTO DO OU ON THIRTEEN MY HOME WAS COMPLETELY BROK AND NO SEMBLANCE OF THE REALITY IT WAS BEFORE YOU KNOW WHOARE THAT THE MALES IN MY LIFE I'M GOING TO ORIENT TO AND FORTUNATELY FOR ME I SIGNED MENTORS TO ME WHETHER NOT THEY KNEW IT OR NOT YETHAT REALLY HELP ME ALONG AND I CHANGED THEM UP AS YOU RECOMMEND THERE WASN'T ONE EAM I UNDERSTOOD THERE WAS A BREAKING UP PROCESS AND INTEGRATION PROCESS COMBINING AND THREADING TOGETHER DIFFERENT THINGS I THINK I TRULY BELIEVE THAT THAT'S WHAT'S REQUIRED THEN A DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ONE HUNDRED PER CENT GARRY COOPER IT CAN BE O TEN PER CENT ROBERT GREEN TEN PER CENT SOME ONE ELSE TE I KNOW FIVE PER CENT THIS AND CREATING A PIE CHART OF SORTS OF YOU KNOW WHO ONE WISHES TO BE IN A GIVEN CONTEXT N THAT TAKES WORK IT TAKES A BIT OF WORK AND DISCERNMENT BUT GOSH THAT'S POWERFUL IM AND IREALLY CREDIT GOES TO YOU BECAUSE I YOU KNOW YOU ERE A MENTRO MIND YOU DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE IT IN THE WAY THE YOU FORGE AND ORGANIZE INFORMATION AND THERE WERE OTHERS AND BUT MASTERY IS WHERE I LEARNED TO DO THAT AND THIS IS NOT A PODCAST ATS  A ASSAILS BITCH FOR MASTERY BUT GASA REALLY TAUGHT ME O KAY HAVE A GRADUATE ADVISER SHE WAS WONDERFUL AND BRILLIANT BUT SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN ALL LOT OF THINGS TO ME SO I'D FIND SOME ONE ELSE FOR THAT I AND SOME ONE ELSE FOR THE OTHER THING AND SOME ONE ELSE FOR THE OTHER THING AND TOGETHER CREATE A PATCHWORK OF OF REALLY EXCELLENT MENTERS THAT MADE A LOT OF CENSE TO ME YI SO I I THINK THERE'S A A ROLL FOR THAT PROCESS THAT YOU SPELL OUT IN MASTERY IN THE LARGER CONTECTS OF THE COUTE BECOME AS A PERSON IN THAT INCLUDES MASCULINE AND EMINENT IDEALS YE D IT'S AN UNGOING PROSCESS THROUGHOUT YOUR LIFE SO WHO YOU GLOMDON TOO WHEN YOU WERE FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN WILL CHANGE WHEN YOURE NINETEEN I HAD A SERIES OF PEOPLE LIKE YOUR TALKING ABOUT MY HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH TEACH YOU HAD AN ENORMOUS IMPACT ON ME WHO TAUGHT ME BASICALLY HOW TO WRITE I INTERNALIZED HIS VOICE WHEN I WENT TO BERKELEY I HAD A PROFESSOR THERE WHO BECAME MY KIND OF SURRUGAT FATHER AT BERKELEY WHO I DEEPLY ADMIRED FOR HIS LEVEL OF SCHOLARSHIP SO HE BECAME KIND OF AN INTELLECTUALE ROLE MODEL LATER IN LIFE WHEN I FINALLY WROTE MY FIRST BOOK I MET A MAN YOSS ELPHERS WHO IS A BOOK PACKAGER WHO UNDERSTOOD THE BUSINESS ET CETERA HE KIND OF SAVED ME HE WAS SORT OF MY MENT OR FOR THE NEXT PHASE IN MY LIFE SO ON AND ON AND ON I FOUND PEOPLE BUT THEY HAVE POSITIVE QUALITIES QUALITIES THEY ADMIRE THEY'RE NOT PERFECT EVERY ONE IS FLAWED AND SO AT SOME POINT MAY BE YOU SEE TOO MANY OF THE FLAWS YOU GO ON I NEED SOMEBODY KNEW IN MY LIFE BUT THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT IT'S NOT LIKE YOUR YUR YOUR VIOLATING ANY CODES OR HURTING THEM YOU MOVE ON TO SOMEBODY ELSE BUT THE SENSE OF FINDING PEOPLE WHOSE QUALITIES YOU ADMIRE WE DON'T LEARN FROM PEOPLE JUST BY FOLLOWING THEIR IDEAS WE PICK UP THEIR ENERGY THEIR SPIRIT NOW YOU DIDN'T NESERELY PICK UP MY ENERGY OR SPIRIT FROM READING MASTER OFTHOUGH MAYBE YOU DID I DON'T KNOW BUT WHEN YOU INJUREACTING WITH THAT PROFESSOR AT STANFORD OR WHATEVER IS NOT JUST VERBALY THERE'S KIND OF ANONVERABLE COMMUNICATION GOING ON YOU'RE INTERNALIZING SOME OF THE POSITIVE QUALITIES THAT YOU SAW IN THEM AND FINDING THESE SERIES OF MENTORS CAUSE I CALL IT SURRIGAT PARENTS YOU CAN'T CHOOSE YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER BUT YOU CAN CHOOSE THESE IDEALS FOR YOU CAN CHOOSE THESE MNTOARS IN YOUR LIFE YOU CAN KIND OF REAL RIGHT YOUR FAMILY HISTORY AND FIND THAT FATHER FIGURE YOU NEVER HAD BY GLOMMING ON TO THIS PERSON BUT IT HAS TO B E THE RIGHT FIT HAS TO BE SOME ONE THAT YOU CONNECT TO EMOTIONALLY AN INTELLECTUALLY AND THAT HAS THE POSITIVE QUALITIES YOU WISH FOR YOURSELF ELL EMBARRASS YOU PERHAPS BY SAYING THAT A SINCE I WAS A FRESHMAN IN COLLEGE WHICH IS REALLY WHEN I TURND MY ACADEMIC LIFE AROUND AND REALLY MY LIFE AROUND I'VE MAN TAIN THE SAME NOTE BOOK WITH A LIST OF NAMES OF PEOPLE THAT I ADMIRING WHO I'M AM YOU DON'T TRY TO EMULATE IN SOME WAY NOT IN EVERY WAY CERTAINLY AND THAT CERT NAMES HAVE BEEN CROSSED OFF BUT AM MOST OF THEM HAVE SURVIVED AND AND CERTAINLY AFTER READING MASTERY YOUR NAME MADE THAT LIST AND A AND AND  I'M NOT BEING CROSSED OFFITS NO NOT AT ALL NOT NOT AT ALL D THROUGH READING MASTERY THERE WERE THERE WERE ADDITIONAL NAMES UM YOU KNOW I HAD THE THE GREAT MISFORTUNE OF HAVING ALL THREE OF MY ACADEMIC ADVISERS DIE SUICIDE CANCER CANCER WHICH SOUNDS TRAGIC THE JOKE IN MY FEELD AS YOU DON'T WANT ME TO WORK FOR YOU VERYBDY THAT'SWHATEVER ONE SAYS BUT BY BEING ESSENTIALLY SCIENTIFICALLY ORPHANED AS THERE'S A STRONG MENTOR MENTE RELATIONSHIP IN SCIENCE AND PROGRESSION THROUGH THE CREER A TRACK IT FORCED ME TO GO OUT AND FIND OTHER PEOPLE AND ALSO TO LEARN HOW TO COLDN'T QUOTE MOTHER AND FATHER MYSELF IN THE CONTEXTS OF PROFESSION AND I GOT A LOT OF HELP BUT AM I I CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH HOW VALUABLE THAT PRACTICE IS AND SO WHEN ONE LOOKS OUT ON THE LANDSCAPE OF SOCIAL MEDIA OPTIONS MTHESE ARE ARE LITERALLY JUST OPTIONS OF PEOPLE TO AND WE CALL IT FOLLOWING BUT UM YOU KNOW IT SH UL PROBABY LOY BE CALLED SOMETHING ELSE A BECAUSE FOLLOWING YOU KNOW IS FALL SHORT OF EMULATING OR ATTEMPTING TO EMULATE BUT I THINK THAT IN THE CONTECTS OF MASCULINE IN FEMININE IDEALS THIS IS SO CRITICAL BUT'S LIKE THE BUFFET OF FOOD IS SO ENORMOUS NOW RIGHT IM OU'VE GOT EVERY QUIZINE ON THE TABLE AND THY WERE NOT YOU WERE NOT WIRED FOR THAT NO AND I KNOW PERSONALLY I I COULD VERY AGITATE AN UPSET IF I GO TO THE MARKET AND I HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THIRTY ILOMS AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I WANT IT MAKES ME REALLY CRANK AN UPSET WHERES IF I KNOW O KAT I CANNOT HAVE THIS FOOD ACAN HAVE THAT I ONLY LOOKING FOR THIS O CAY IT'S EASY DOESN'T TAKE TOO HOURS AND WASTE MY TIME TOO MUCH CHOICE IS VERY DETRIMENTAL TO THE HUMAN BEING I THINK AND THAT'S WHY WE GOING BACK TO WHAT I ORIGINALLY SAID WHEN YOU HAVE THAT SENSE OF PURPOSE ABOUT YOUR LIFE ABOUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT IT DOES JUST AS INFECTS YOUR CAREER BUT INFECTS EVERYTHING YOU DO SO YOU KNOW EATING THIS FOOD IS GOING TO DRAIN ME OF MY ENERGY THAT I NEED TO CREATE THIS THING THAT MEANS SO MUCH TO ME AND ENERGY AND FEELING MY MY BRAIN ACTIVE AND ALIVE IS INCREDITLING PORNT VALUE AR RIGHT I'M NOT CAN EAT ALL THAT SUGAR BECAUSE IT'S BAD FOR ME RIGHT IT MEANS I'M NOT GOING TO GET OUTRAGED BY THESE THINGS ON THE ENTENIT BECAUSE IT'S A WASTE OF TIME I CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT IS JUST FEEDING ON MY YOU KNOW ON MY I FORGET THE PART OF THE BRAIN THAT THAT'S LIKE THE MIGDELA OR WHATEVER RIGHT SO NO I DON'T WANT TO GO THERE RIGHT AND ON AN ON AND ON ALL THESE THINGS AND SOCIA MEDI SOME OF ITS GOOD SOME OF ITS INTERESTING I CAN FOLLOW ANDRUW HUBERMAN'S PODCAST AND I ENJOY THEN I LEARN A LOT FROM BUT A LOT OF THESE PODCASTS ARE USELESS THAT  NOT HELPING ME IN ANY WAY SO IT GIVES YOU THIS KIND OF FILTER AND THIS RAD ARE TO CUT OUT THOSE A HUNDRED DIFFERENT CHOICES THAT DRIVE US ABSOLUTELY CRAZY AND I KNOW MAYBE I'M PARTIALLY I MAYBE I'M A LITTLE BIT I DON'T KNOW I SAY I MAY BEUNPARTALY ON THE SPECTUMMER SOMELI BUT I CAN'T TRANT CAN'T STAND TOO MANY CHOICES IT COMPLETELY DRIVES ME NUTS SO I ALWAYS HAVE TO KIND OF FUN ON MY ENERGY INTO SOMETHING TO THINGS THAT ARE PRODUCTIVE AND HAVING A SENSE OF YOUR PURPOSE WHENEVER YOU DISCOVERED IN YOUR TWENTIES HOPEFULLY GIVES YOU THAT ABILITY TO SAY THESE ARE THE POSITIVE ROLE MODELS I WANT MY LIFE THESE ARE THE MENT TORS AND THE THING ABOUT FOLLOWING PEOPLE AN SOCIA MES IT'S SO EASY AS JUST A CLICK DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING A MENTAL RELATIONSHIP TAKES WORK IT TAKES COURAGE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY GO UP TO SOMEBODY AND PHYSICALLY ASK FOR THEIR HELP AND A LOT OF PEOPLE WRITE TO ME SAY I'M AFRAID OF ASKING THIS IMPORTANT POWERFUL PERSON TO BE THEIR MENTE RIGHT SO IT INVOLVES A SENSE OF SOCIAL COURAGE WHERE YOU HAVE TO LITERALLY ENGAGE WITH ANOTHER HUMAN BEING WHO YU ADMIRED YOU THINK IS POWERFUL SO IT'S BUILDING YOUR SOCIAL SKILLS ET CETERA BUT IT'S A SKILL YOU DEVELOP YOU CAN'T JUST FOLLOW SOME ONE YOU CAN'T JUST WATCH THEIR LECTURES YOU HAVE TO ENGAGE WITH THEM AND YOU HAVE TO GET OVER SOME OF YOUR FEARS IN YOUR ANXIETIES IN THE PROCESS AND I MIGHT ADD TO IT ATHINK EVERYTHING WHE SAYS ABSOLUTLY TRUE AND I THINK I'M ENGAGING IN THE THE VARIOUS UM TOOLS THAT THEY WRECOMMEND IS IMMENSELY HELPFUL LIKE I THINK YO ARE HEARING ABOUT A BOOK AS GREAT READING A BOOK AS EVEN BETTER I'M THINKING ABOUT A BOOK AS EVEN THAT YOU READ IS EVEN BETTER THAN THAT AND THEN A WRITING DOWN YOUR OWN IDEAS AND WRITING A BOOK WELL THAT'S THAT'S THE BIG WIND WRITE AND THAT'S WHAT THE WORLD I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT THE UNIVERSE WANTS FROM US NOT SARELY TO WRITE A BOOK BUT YOU DON'T TRANSLATE WHAT I JUST SAD ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ENDEAVOURS  YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO THINK FOR YOURSELF RIGHT SO YOU'RE NOT JUST ABSORBING IDEAS FROM OTHER PEOPLE IN KIND OF MIMICING THEM AND KIND OF JUST LEARNING THE EXTERIORS OF THEIR IDEAS YOU WANT A KIND OF DIGEST THEM AND THEN HAVE THEM SLOWLY BECOME YOUR OWN IDEAS BY INTERACTING WITH THEM AND BY CREATING TI PUTTING THEM THROUGH YOUR OWN LENDS SO SOME DAY IT'S IT'S A BOOK STIRRING IN ME IS THE ART OF THINKING AND HOW TO USE THAT KIND OF PROCESS AND GO DEEPER INTO IT AND I TALKED A LOT ABOUT IT IN ONE OF MY PODCASTS WHICH MIGHT BE THE SEED OF A BOOK BUT IT'S IT'S THE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DEAD THINKING AND A LIVE THINKING IDEAS CAN BE EITHER ALIVE OR THEY CAN BE DEAD AND N ALIVE IDEA IS SOMETHING THAT ENTERS YOUR BRAIN FROM AN EXTERNAL SOR RSE A PHILOSOPHER AN ARTICLE SOMEBODY YOU ADMIRE SOMEBODY YOU HATE AND THEN YOU ABSORB IT AND YOU THINK ABOUT IT AND YOU DECIDE I'M GING TO TURN IT AROUND INTO THIS AND I'M GOING TO MAKE IT ALIVE CAN MAKE IT SOMETHING THAT'S PART OF ME ANOTHER PART OF AN ALIVE IDEA IS UM YOU HAVE AN IDEA THAT COMES TO YOU ABOUT A BOOK OR A PROJECT OR SOMETHING ABOUT THE WORLD AND YOU GO MAYBE THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY TRUE MAYBE THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE AND YOU GO THROUGH A PROCESS AND YOU CYCLE THROUGH IT ON AN ONORN YOU REFLECT ON IT AND YOU REFINE THIS IDEA AND MAYBE IT TURNS INTO ITS OPPOSITE AND THROUGH THE PROCESS OF REFLECTING AND CORRECTING AND REVISING IT YOU TURN IT INTO SOMETHING LIVING SOMETHING ALIVE WITHIN YOU RIGHT ONONON AND WHAT PREVENTS PEOPLE FROM GOING THROUGH THAT PROCESS WHICH WOUD BE THE SUBJECT OF MY BOOK IS BASICALLY ANXIETY BECAUSE I THINK HOW YOU HANDLE ANXIETY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT KIND OF QUALITY AND LIVILLE DETERMINE WHETHER YOU WILL BE SUCCESSFUL WHETHER YOU WILL FIND YOUR CAREER PATH OR WHETHER YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO I DON'T IF YOU CAN FOLLOW THAT IDEA AT ALL BUT UM ANXIETY IS A SIGNAL TO YOU THAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND SOMETHING THAT THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM OUT THERE THAT THAT YOU CAN'T RESOLVE AND SO WHAT HAPPENS TO MOST PEOPLE IF YOU ARE INSECURE IS YOU GLOM ON TO SOMETHING INSTANT AN EASY TO GET RID OF YOUR FEELNG OF ANXIETY I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS PROOH IT MUST BE A MU A MUST BE THE ANSWER BECAUSE THIS PERSON SAID THAT RIGHT AND SO YOU DON'T DEVELOP THE ATHEABILITY TO THINK YOUN' FELT TE BILING TO GO TO THE NEXT LEVEL BUT IF YOU TAKE THAT ANXIETY AND YOU GO RIGHT MAYBE E IS AN ANSWER AND THEN YOU START GOING THROUGH AND THEN YOU GO NO MAYBE EH ISN'T THE ANSWER MAYBE BE IS THE ANSWER YOU'RE ABLE TO SURMOUNT YOUR ANXIETY AND GO PAST FURTHER AND FURTHERN FOR YOU DON'T RUSH FOR THE FIRST AVAILABLE ANSWER THAT'S OUT THERE RIGHT YOU'RE ABLE TO GO THROUGH A PROCESS OF REFINING THINGS AND SO IN YOUR CAREER IF YOU'RE ANXIOUS FOR SUCCESS IF YOU'RE ANXIOUS FOR MONEY YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE THE WRONG CHOICES BUT IF YOU'RE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THAT ANXIETY AND SAY MAYBE I'M HAVE TO THINK MORE DEEPLY ABOUT WHERE I'M GOING HAVE TO COME UP WITH OTHER ALTERNATIVES THEN YOU CAN MAKE A MUCH BETTER CHOICE ON AND ON AND ON SO HOW IF YOU DEAL IF YOU'RE CREATIVE PERSEAND IT'S VERY VERY CHALLENGING TO HAVE THAT BLANK PIECE OF PAPER BEFORE YOU THAT BOOKTHAT YOU HAVEN'T WRITTEN THAT FILM OR WHATEVER YOU'RE FILLED WITH A LOT OF ANXIETY AND YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT AND IF YOU'RE ABLE TO TURN INTO SOMETHING CREATIVE AND PRODUCTIVE THEN GREAT THINGS WILL HAPPEN YOU'LL CREATA MASTERPIECE SO THE ABILITY TO DEAL WITH ANXIETY AND NOT GIVE INTO THE MOST INSTANT GRATIFICATION YOU CAN GET IS TO ME A MARKET OF SOMEBODY WILL BE CREATIVE AND WILL INVENT SOMETHING I SUPPOSE TO PEOPLE WHO JUST RECYCHAELE OLD AND DEAD IDEAS AMEN TO THAT IA WAS ONCE TOLD THAT YOU ANXIETY MAKES CHILDREN OF US ALL AND NOT IN THE POSITIVE SENSE OF BEING CHILD LIKE I KNOW IT IT REGRESSES US TO A MODE WHERE WE FEEL A COMPLETE LACK OF CONTROL AND I COMPLETELY AGREE THAT BEING ABLE TO MANAGE ANXIETY AND AND WORK DANCE WITH IT AS WE CAN'T RID OURSELVES OF IT NO NEPERHAPS NOR SHOULD WE RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S A SIGNAL AS YOU POINT OUT THAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND SOMETHING THAT THERE'S THERE'S SOMETHING TO GET CURIOUS ABOUT RIGHT A PROCESS OR SOMETHING OUT THERE OR BOTH I THINK  THAT REALLY RESINATES YEI THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL BENEFIT FROM FROM HEARING THAT BECAUSE I WE HEAR THE WORD FLOW AND WE JUST ALL IMAGINE I EVEN CATCH MYSELF IMAGINING THAT YOU KNW WHEN ROBERT GREEN SITS DOWN TO RIGHT IT'S LIKE THERE'S A BLANK SHE AND THEN HE JUST GONE TO MEDITATES AND THEN BOOM OUTCOME THESE BOOKS AH BUT I YOU DONIF I GET REALISTIC FOR AS ICAN I'M SURE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF INTER TURMOIL AND ANXIETY  YOU HAVE NO IDEA SO A MY PROCESS IS IS NINETY FIVE PER CENT PAIN AND MAY BE TWO AND A HALF PER CENT ECSTASY AND I DON'T KNO WHAT THE OTHER TWO AND A HALF PER CENT WOULD BE BUT I'M SO I WRITE A STORY CAUSE ALL IN MY NEW BOOK IN MOST OF MY BOOKS I ALWAYS BEGIN WITH THE STORY FROM HISTORY ET CETERA IT IS SO BAD I JUST  CAN'T BELIEVE HOW BAD HOW FLAT IT IS HOW IT SUCKS I'M SO EMBARRASSED I HATE MYSELF AND I GO IN A GOOD DIG INTO AN I START CHANGING THE WORDS AND IT I START MAKING A LITTLE BUT BETTER THE SECOND VERSION IT'S KIND OF PALATABLE BUT IT STILL SUCKS IT'S IF I LET IT OUT O THE WORLD BE VERY EMBARRASSING I WORK I IT'S ANXI ANXIOUS YOU KNOW AND MY WIFE CAN TELL YOU I'M A MISERABLE BEING WHEN THAT HAPPENS EVERYTHING LOOKS BLACK TO ME AT THAT POINT AND I PUSH THROUGH IT SO IF I GAVE IN TO MY ANXIETY AND THIS HAPENS WITH A LOT OF BOOKS AND WRITERS I WOULD JUST PUT OUT THAT SECOND VERSION WHICH ISN'T VERY GOOD IT ISN'T VERY STRONG IT ISN'T THOUGHT THROUGH BECAUSE MY IDEAS WHEN I LOOK AT THEM THE FIRST TIME AGO THAT'S NOT REAL THAT'S NOT THE ACTUAL THING THAT'S GOING ON HERE ROBERTS YOU'VE MISSED THE MARK YOU WANT TO IT WHAT'S ACTUALLY REAL IN THAT STORY SO YOU HAVE TO GO DEEPER AND DEEPER AND HARDER AND HARDER AND HARDER SO I DON'T JUST GIVE UP AND GO HERE'S THE CHAPTER IT'S GOT TO BE BETTER IT'S GOT TO BE BETTER UNTI FINELY AFTER TWO MONTHS OF STRUGGLING IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S IT'S GONE TO THE PLACE THAT I WANT IT TO BE IN RIGHT BUT I I USE THAT ANXIETY TO KEEP IMPROVING AND MAKING BETTER AND THEN WHEN I REACH THAT POINT AND THE STORY IS GOOD ENOUGH AND I CAN LET MY WIFE READ IT AND THEN MY EDITOR I FEEL GREAT I HAVE THAT TWO PER CENT MOMENT OF JOY BUT IT CAME THROUGH ALL OF THAT ANXIETY BUT I CAN TELL YOU THE FEELING OF FULFILLMENT WHEN I FINISH A CHAPTER IS PRETTY DAMN GREAT WHEN I FINISH A BOOK IT'S BETTER THAN ANY KIND OF DRUG EXPERIENCE ANY ONE COULD EVER HAVE T' SUCH A WONDERFUL FEELING OF ACCOMPLISHMENT AN PUSHING PAST ALL THE BARRIERS YOU KNOW SO MY PROCESS INVOLVES A LOT OF ANXIETY AND D YOU THINK THAT'S WHY I AM TALKING ABOUT IN WHY WHYNT TO RIDE A BOOK ABOUT IT THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT NO I'M ATTEMPTING TO WRITE A BOOK AND HAVE BEEN FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND NOW I FEEL LITTLE BIT BETTER BUT CLEARLY I NEED TO RATCH IT DOWN HARDER AM BUT IN OTHER DOMAINS OF LIFE I I AM FAMILIAR WITH THE EXPERIENCE OF TONS OF ANXIETY AND JUST REACAMANA JUST GET TO THIS ONE MILESTONE AND THEN I'LL FIGURE OUT THE NEXT MILESTONE BUT EVEN THAT PROCESS OF SAYING I'OK GAMMEN TO BREAK THIS DOWN INTO MILESTONES ITSELF IS ANXIETY PROVOKE UR IT'S JUST THA BUT SOME POINT IT GENERATES ENOUGH A NERSA YUATHEY JUST SORT OF STUMBLE FORWARD INTO THE PROCESS AND THE I KEEP GOING SAITRANITO BLOODY ONESELF THARE TOO MUCH I THINK A LOT PEOPLE BENEFIT FROM HEARING ABOUT THAT AND INFACT I'M CERTAIN THEY WILL SO SPEAKING OF ANXIETY YOU HAVE A CLIP ON THE INTERNETE THAT WE WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO IN THE SHOWNOTE CAPTIONS WHICH I THINK IS ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS ABOUT HOW TO FIND A ROMANTIC PARTNER AND OR GET MORE OUT OF AN EXISTING ROMANTIC PARTNERSHIP I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER WHAT I SAID YOU U HAVE TO REMIND NOW IT'S SO GOOD A ONE POINT IN PARTICULAR E THAT I REMEMBER AM THAT I THINK IS OH SO TRUE IS THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE AT LEAST ONE AND PROBABLY SEVERAL A POINTS OF LIKE REAL CONVERGENCE IN TERMS OF ONES INTERESTS OR LIKES THAT GO BEYON LIKE WHAT FOOD SOMEBODY LIKES SOR YOU KNOW WHAT TIPE OF HOUSE THEY WANT TO LIVE IN BUT THAT ACTUALLY TRACES BACK TO THESE EARLY FORMS OF DELIGHT AND YOU MENTION A THAT FOR YOU AND THEREFORE PRESUMABLY YOUR PARTNER THAT YOU KNOW A MUTUAL LOVE AND RESPECT FOR ANIMALS HAPPENS BE ONE OF THOSE THINGS WITHIN THE CONTACT OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP RIGHT THAT NOT THAT OR LOVE FOR ANIMALS IS REQUIRED FROM ITSURS A RIGHT TH EXACTLY SO NEVER GO OUT WITH A WOMAN WHO DIDN'T LOVE ANIMAL I MY SISTER USED TO TEASE ME THAT I'M IF A WOMAN GAVE ME A BIRTHDAY CARD OR A CARD THAT HAD A DRAWING OF A PARTICULAR ANIMAL WHICH I AM PATICULARLY FOND OF MY SISTER USE IVE AN OLDER SISTER AN SHE USED TO SAY O NOW IT'S OVER HE'S GONE YOU KOW THAT I WAT T YOU KNOW I'M FORTUNATELY IT  IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE OBUT I THERE'S SUMPTUOUS TO WHAT SHE WAS SAYING IM IT'S CERTAINLY A IT'S NECESSARY BUT NOT EFFICIENT BUT NAN YOU COULD ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT ON THIS NOTION OF AM CONVERSIEN INTEREST AND CONTRAST IT WITH A LOT OF WHAT PEOPLE TENTO HERE AN SAY ABOUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT IN PARTNERSHIP BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE GRAPPLE WITH BOTH IN TERMS OF FINDING AND PARTNER AND IN TERMS OF BUILDING PARTNERSHIP WELL I YAFTER YOU KNOW THERE'S YOU CAN THERE'S DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIPS YOU CAN HAVE ANING DO YOU WANT LIKE A ONE WEEK A ONE MONTH RELATIONSHIP ARE YOU LOOKING FOR SOMETHING LONGER MORE SATISFYING THAT WILL ENTAIL YOU KNOW MAY BE YEARS OF BEING TOGETHER AND A YOU KNOW A PEOPLE CAN GET VERY BORING VERY QUICKLY RIGHT PARTICULARLY IF YOU CAN'T HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THEM ABOUT SUBJECTS THAT INTEREST YOU AND SO YOU MENTION ANIMALS ANIMALS IS VERY GOOD EXAMPLE BECAUSE IT'S NOT I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU BOTH HAVE TO BE DEMOCRATS OR REPUBLICANS THAT'S TOO BAN AN SUPERFICIAL BUT THE LOVE OF ANIMALS REACHES INTO YOUR CHARACTER REACHES SOMETHING DEEP INSIDERY OR YOUR DISLIKE OF ANIMALS THAT HAPPENS TO BE THE CASE BUT IT SIGNALS SOMETHING ABOUT IT THAT'S SO PRIMAL THAT'S SO CONNECTED TO A CHILD THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A DEEP CONNECTION THERE AND SAW LIKE YOU HAVE TO BOTH LOVE CATS WHICH IS GOOD IF THAT HAPPENS TO BE THE CASE BUT JUST ANIMALS AND GENER YOU LOVE THEIR ENERGY YOU LOVE THE FACT THAT THERE THAT THEYRE INNOCENT IN THEIR OWN WAY YOU LOVE THE FATHER THEY'RE NOT PLAYING GAMES WITH YOU YOU LOVE THE KIND OF INSTANT LOVE YOU CAN GET FROM THEM KIND OF THING AND YOU CONNECTED THEM ON THAT LEVEL IS A VERY VERY POSITIVE SIGN BECAUSE IT GOES BEYOND JUST INTELLECTUAL THINGS INTO SOMETHING EMOTIONAL AND VICIRIL SO REALLY THE EMOTIONAL CONNECTIONS THE VALUES THAT YOU HAVE TOGETHER ARE VERY IMPORTANT MONEY IS ANOTHER ONE THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT SO IF ONE OF YOU IS INCREDIBLY MATERIAL ORIENTED AND ITS ALL ABOUT MONEY IS IS IS POWER AND SUCCESS AND COMFORT AND THE OTHER IS IT REALLY INTO IT IS INDESPENDING MONEY SAID HER LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE ENDLESS FIGHTS OR SOMETHING LIKE MONEY RIGHT WHERE THAT THISIS NO CONVERGENCE THERE AND MONEY SIGNALS A DEEPER VALUE ABOUT THE PERSON SO I'M NOT SAYING THIS ANYTHING WRONG IF MONEY MOTIVATES YOU ARE NOT MORALIZING ABOUT IT CAUSE THAT CAN SIGNAL A VALUE THAT MAYBE YOU GREW UP WITHOUT IT AND THAT FEELING COMFORTABLE AND FHIENG LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT SOMETHING IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO YOU AND THOUH NOT BEING INTERESTED MONEY REVEAL SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR CHARACTER SO I'M TELLING PEOPLE YOU WANT A LOOK AT THE PERSON'S CHARACTER AND SEE A KIND OF CONVERGENCE THERE AND SOMEHING THAT CAN LAST AND I REMEMBER I WAS READING UM FOR ONE OF MY BOOKS ABOUT FRANKLIN DELEANOR ROOSEVELT AND ELEANOR ROOSEVELT AND THE THING OF IT WAS FRANKLIN DELLINOR ROOSEVELT WAS HIS INCREDIBLY HANDSOME VIBRANT YOUNG MAN BEFORE HE GOT POLEO VERY ACTIVE VERY ATHLETIC VERY HANDSOME ALL THE WOMEN WERE AFTER HIM HE WAS LIKE THE PERFECT MATCH HE WAS WEALTHY AND ELEANOR ROOSEVELT WAS LIKE THE UGLY DUCKLING SHE WASN'T VERY PRETTY SHE WAS KIND OF SOCIALLY AWKWARD BUT HE SAW INTO HER CHARACTER HE SAW THAT INTELLECTUALLY SHE WAS A MATCH FOR HIM HE SAW THAT THEY HAD KIND OF SIMILAR INTERESTS ON THAT LEVEL THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THE GO BENEATH JUST THE SURFACES AND HE CHOSE ELEANOR AND EVERYONE WAS SHOCKED ABOUT IT YOU KNOW NOBODY WAS WAS TRYING TO COURT ELEANOR I'M FRE HER LAST NAME AT THE TIME I SHOUL I THINK SHEU MIGH HAVE BEEN BEEN FO ROOSEVELT I'M SO IT WAS VERY SHOCKING HE SAID I LOOKED AT SOMEBODY WHO I COULD LAST WITH WHO HAD SOME QUALITIES THAT WERE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT TO ME AND ENTERED AT BEING A VERY SATISFYING RELATISHIP COURSE LATER ON HE HAD HIS DALLIANCE SO IT WASN'T PERFECT BUT IT WAS VERY IT WAS A VERY POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP SO SEEING YOUR VALUES IN LIFE YOU KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO LIKE MONEY WHEN IT COMES TO LIKE CAREER WHEN IT COMES TO COMFORT OR LACK OF COMFORT SOME PEOPLE LIKE NOT BEING COMFORTABLE THEY LIKE BEING ON THE EDGE THEY WANT CHALLENGES THEY WANT TO MOVE FROM CITY TO CITY KIND OF THING AND IF YOU PARTNER WITH SOMEBODY WHO JUST ANTS TO LIVE IN THE SAME HOUSE YOU CAN HAVE CONFLICT AFTER CONFLICT AFTER CONFLICT THE SEX MIGHT BE GREAT AND THAT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR A MONTH OR TWO MUNCE I AVE NOTHING AGAINST THAT I'M NOT GING TO JUDGE THAT EITHER BUT IT WON'T LEAD TO A LONG LASTING RELATIONSHIP YOU KNOW SPORTS AND ATHLETICS ORE ANOTHER THING IS A SOMEONE THAT LIKES THE OUTDOORS OR THAT SOMEONE WHOSE YOU KNOW LIKE JAJARQ GOBORN HAS TO BE IN IN A TIME SQUARE IN A PENT HOUSE IN MANHATTON YOU KNOW KIND OF THING SO VALUES THAT REACH INSIDE OF A IN CHARACTER THAT ARE DEEPLY IN GRAINED THAT YOU CAN ALMOST NOT CHANGE YOU CAN'T CONTROL  THERE'S A CONVERGENCE THERE ON SEVERAL LEVELS IS A SIGN THAT YOU CAN HAVE A DEEP CONNECTION WITH THAT PERSON N IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND IF THOSE CONNECTIONS ARE GOOD AND THERE'S A PHYSICAL ATTRACTION BECAUSE IF WITHOUT THE PHYSICAL ATTRACTION IT WILL KIND OF FIS ALOUD YOU'VE GOT TE RECIPE FOR FOR A CREDIBLE SUCCESS FOR SOMTHING THAT CAN REALLY LAST AND HAVING A LASTING RELATIONSH IP AS I'VE HAD IS IS SUCH AN ANCHOR IN YOUR LIFE YOU KNOW FME FOR SOMEONE WHO WORKS AS HARD AS I DO AND HOPEFULLY FOR HER AS WELL IT JUST GROUNDS ME AND IT MAKES LIFE SO MUCH SIMPLER AND EASIER AND AND IT'S NOT JUST SIMPLE AND EASY THIS A LOT OF LOVE AND A A GREAT DEAL OF OF A DEEPER EMOTIONS INVOLVED BUT HAVING A LONG TERN RELATIONSHIP IF YOU CAN HAVE IT IS SOMETHING THAT PAYS OFF IN SO MANY DIVID ENDS SO BEING ABLE TO FIND THAT KIND OF CONVERGENCE YOU KNOW WHEN I FIRST MET MY NOW MY WIFE UM I HAD A CAT THE TIME I'D ALWAYS BEEN A DOG PRESE BUT THIS IS A CAT I HAD AND I LOVE THAT CAT LIKE CAT I CAN'T BELIVE HE WAS SUCH A WONDERFUL CAT I BROUGHT HER OVER TO MY APARTMENT ON THE FIRST DATE I WANTED TO SEE HER REACTION TO THE CAT YOU KNOW CAUSE I GENERALLY AND IKNOWPUIL MISJUDGE THAT WOMEN WHO DON'T LIKE CATS I I DON'T CAN'T GET ALONG WITH RIGHT IS THERE SOMETHING FEELINE IN THE FEMININE NATURE THAT I LOVE SHE LOVED MY CAT BOY THAT WAS THE BEST SIGN OF ALL AND THINGS JUST BLOST AND SHE LOVED ME FOR LOVING A CAT SO THERE WAS A GREAT CONVERGENCE RIGHT THERE THAT WE SAW RIGHT AWAY THEN THERE WERE OTHER THINGS BUT THAT WAS THE FIRST ONE I LOVE THAT STORY AND EVERYTHING YOU JUST SAID SUGGESTS I BELIEVE THAT YOU N ORDER TO FIND THE RIGHT PARTNER AND TO BUILD AN EXISTING PARTNERSHIP THAT HOPEFULLY FEELS AT LEAST PARTIALLY RIGHT TO BEOPLE THAT IT REQUIRES AT LEAST SOME KNOWING OF SELF BECAUSE UNLESS YOU KNOW YOUR CHARACTER OR ONE'S OWN CHARACTER THAN IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO REALLY I DETERMINE IF SOMEBODY ELSE IS CHARACTER IS GOING TO MESH WELL WITH IT OR NOT SELF AWARENESS IS IS ACTUALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT QUALITY IN LIFE FOR ALL ASPECTS BUT YET I MEAN IF WE GO BY SOCIAL PRESSURES A MAN WILL CHOOSE A TROPHY WIFE WHO OK SEXY AND HOT AND WILL IMPRESS ALL HIS MALE FRIENDS ET CETERA ET CETERA YOU GO BY THE THINGS AT CULTURE TELLS YOU THAT THESE ARE THE RIGHT IMAGES FOR YOU RIGHT AND THEN THERE WON'T BE ANY CONNECTION TO U BECAUSE YOU'RE CHOOSING FOR PURPOSES T DON'T CONNECT TO WHO YOU ARE AND SO YOU HAVE TO KNOW YOURSELF YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT YOU LOVE YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT YOU HATE I THINK MOST PEOPLE KNOW THAT THEY LOVE ANIMALS OR DON'T LOVE ANIMALS I THINK MOST PEOPLE KNOW THAT THEY LIKE STUBILITY OR THEY LIKE THINGS TO BE KIND OF SLIGHTLY CHAOTIC I THINK YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH DEEP LEVELS OF INTROSPECTION BUT WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS WHEN YOU'RE INVOLVED IN A RELATIONSHIP YOU HAVE TO THINK THAT THOSE THINGS MATTER THAT'S THE PROBLEM YOU TEND TO THINK THAT THOSE THINGS MAY THINK THAT SEX MATTERS MORE THAN ANYTHING PHYSICAL ATTRACTION MATTERS OR YOU THINK THAT THE PERSON HAVING A LOT OF MONEY MATTERS ET CETERA ET CETERA YOU DON'T THINK THAT THIS OTHER ASPECT IS IMPORTANT IF YOU VALUE WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THEN YOURSELF AWARENESS WI KICKING CAUSE YOU REALLY BASICALLY KNOW THESE ESSENTIAL BASIC PARTS ABOUT YOUR OWN CHARACTER ITHINK PEOPLE SOMETIMES GET I'M DISTRACTED BY ADMIRATION OF QUALITIES THAT THEY MIGHT FIND ADMIRABLE BUT THAT DON'T MASH WITH THEIR OWN CHARACTER I'VE SEEN THIS MANY TIMES BEFORE WHERX WELL I WHERE SOME ONE WILL SAY IT WILL THAT SOME ONE WILL START LISTING OFF THE POSITIVE ATTRIBUTES OF THE PERSON THAT THEY HAPPEN TO BE DATING LIKE HE DOES THIS BLANK BLANK AND BLANK SHE DOES THIS YOU KNOW HE VOLUNTEERS ET CETERA AND THAT'S ALL GREAT I MEAN VOLUNTEERING FOR GOOD CAUSES I'M ALLIN SUPPORT OF THAT BUT THEN WHAT THEY'RE OVERLOOKING OFTEN IT SEEMS IS WHETHER NOT THAT'S COR VALUE FOR THEM OR WHETHER NOT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT THEY ADMIRE I HEARE A LOT OF ADMIRATION IN THE EARLY DAYS OF RELATIONSHIPS THAT LATER I HEAR ABOUT FAILING I AM WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS SOMETHING DEEPER MORE AA LINED WITH ONE'S OWN SENSE OF SELF AND IT'S ALMOST E LEADS ME TO USE THE WORD OU N A SORT OF WERE ABOUT AND YOUR JEDDAC SIT'S LIKE MERGING OF PEOPLE'S ENERGIES WHICH SOUNDS VERY NEW AGY AND AM THAT'S NOT MY INTENTION BUT BUT I THINK IT RELATES TO SOMETHING THAT WE DO HEAR A LOT ABOUT AND I THINK IT'S VALID WHICH IS HOW IT FEELS TO BE AROUND SOMEBODY IN DIFFERENT CONTECTS LIKE DO WE FEEL AT EASE DO WE FEEL LIKENESS AND ABILITY TO EXPRESS OURSELVES AND TO AND DO WE ENJOY AND ADMIRE THEM IN THEIR EXPRESSION I SUPPOSE TO JUST ADMIRING WHAT THEY DO THEY'VE ACCOMPLISHED BLANK BLANK AND BLANK I SAY RIGHT THEY A MANIFEST THESE QUALITIES THAT I WISH I HAD RIGHT YOU HEAR THAT AND AN ASPIRE TO HAVE WHICH IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN A MASHING OF OF ENERGIES ALSO OTHER COUPLE OTHER THINGS YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR CHARACTER AS WELL AND PEOPLE CAN BE VERY DECEPTIVE AND VERY SLIPPERY AND CAN WEAR MASKS ONE TELLING SIGN THAT I'VE NOTICED IN MY OWN RELATIONSHIPS IN THE PAST IS THAT THE WOMAN WOULD BE A CERTAIN WAY WITH ME THAT I THOUGHT WAS VERY GOOD AND I LIKED AND THEN THE MOMENT WE WERE WITH OTHER PEOPLE SHE ACTED IN A WAY THAT WAS VERY IRRITATING I'S LIKE A DIFFERENT CHARACTER AND I REALLY KIND OF FELL OUT OF LOVE WITH HER WHEN I SAW HER IN SOCIAL INTERACTIONS SHE REVEALED SO WITH ME SHE WAS ALMOST WEARING A MASK AN PLAYING GAME BUT THE MOMENT SHE ENTERED A DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCE I SAW OTHER ASPECT TO HER CHARACTER SO YOU ALSO HAVE TO BE VERY ATTENTIVE TO THEIR CHARACTER WHAT LIES UNDERNEATH THAT THEY HAVE SOME OF THESE VALUES THAT THEY 'RE NOT JUST TRYING TO WHEN YOU OVER FOR WHATEVER N ERE PLAYING ALONG WITH YOU THE OTHER THING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT IS A SENSE OF MYSTERY SO A PARTNER CAN BECOME BORING VERY VERY QUICKLY RIGHT AFTER A YEAR YOU KNOW EVERY SINGLE THING ABOUT THEM RIGHT THERE CAN SAY THE SAME THINGS THI CONVERSATIONS GO ROUND IN CIRCLES IT JUST YOU'VE REACHED AN END THERE'S NO SURPRISES THERE'S NO MYSTERY YOU WANT SOMEBODY WHERE THEY HAVE C NDERS THAT YOU DON'T REALLY SEE AT FIRST THAT THEY SURPRISE YOU SOMETIMES SUDDENLY THERE'S A QUALIT THAT YOU HADNT SUSPECTED BEFORE SO PEOPLE WHO ARE TOO OBVIOUS WHO ERE TOO FAMILIAR WHO SHOW EVERYTHING INSTANTLY THERE CAN END O BORING YOU RIGHT BUT PEOPLE WHO HAVE A BIT OF RESERVE I'M AN I NLES IS MAY BE  I'M PROJECTING MY OWN VALUES ON THE WORLD BUT PEOPLE WHO WHO KIND OF ENTREAT YOU THAT YOU DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT MAKE YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE AND IF THEY CAN BE LIKE THAT AFTER TWO YEARS OR THREE YEARS OR FIVE YEARS WHILE THAT'S FANTASTIC BUT THE SENSE OF I KNOW EVERY SINGLE THING ABOUT THIS PERSON THEY NEVER SURPRISE ME ANY MORE IS WHAT KIND OF BREAKS THE THE THE ENCHANTMENT AND LEAVS TO THE END OF THE RELATIONSHIP FOR THE IDEA OF MORE TO LEARN ABOUT SOMEBODY AM PERHAPS ALSO SUGGESTS THAT THEY ARE CONTINUING TO EVOLVE INTO FORAGE IN THE LANDSCAPE OF LIFE YE OTHER THEY'RE NOT FULLY BAKED THE EYE THAT WHICH I THINK IS A AN INTERESTING IDEA IN DURING THE  FOR EPISODE SERIES THAT WE DID ON MENTAL HEALTH PALCONTIAS ECHITRA SAID THAT A A MATCHING OF GENERATIVE DRIVES WHICH HE DEFINED AS THE DESIRE TO CREATE SOMETHING IN THE WORLD OF ONE'S OWN EXPRESSION IS REALLY CRITICAL IN RELATIONSHIP AND HE SAID YOU KNOW IT MATTERS LAST WEATHER NOT ONE PERSON LIKES CLASSICAL MUSIC IN THE OTHER PERSON ROCK AND ROLL PROVIDED THAT THEIR RELATIONSHIP TOO MUSIC IS SIMILAR OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT LIKE THAT IT'S ABOUT A DRIVE TO OF A CERTAIN SORT TO ENGAGE IN THE WORLD SO ONE PERSON COULD LOVE MUSIC THE OTHER PERSONS NOT INTO MUSIC BUT THE WAY THAT THEY APPROACH LIFE IS ONE OF PERHAPS MUTUAL CURIOSITY DESIRE TO FIND OUT ET CETERA AND THAT THAT IS EXISTS ON A CONTINUUM I CURIOUS IF  SEEMS TO GIVE WITH WHAT YOU'RE WITH RSAYS BUT THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD IS IF YOU LOVE CLASSICAL MUSIC AND THEY LOVE LIKE HEAVY METAL MUSIC YOU'RE GING TO BE DRIVEN CRAZY PRETTY QUICKLY ITS CONN YOU KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO MESH WITH YOU AND I KNOW I WOULD HAVE THAT P YOU'LL BOTH BE IN HEADPHONES A LITSO THE FACT THAT YOU BOTH HAVE CAUSE MUSIC IS LIKE ANIMALS IN A WAY SO I AGREE COMPLETELY WITH WHAT YOU SAYG BUT I WOULD SAY MAY BE MUSIC IS IN THE BEST EXAMPLE BECAUSE MUSICS IS SOMETHING VERY DEEP ABOUT A PERSON RIGHT THERE'S A YOU KNOW I'M NOT SAY ONE IS SUPERIOR TO THE OTHER BUT IT REVEALS SOMETHING THAT'S NON VERBAL THAT THAT KIND GIVES YOU A WINDOW INTO WHO THEY ARE SO IF THEY LIKE PUNK ROC LIKE YOU DO AND I GREW UP ON PONK ROCK THERE'S A REBELLIOUS THING THIS TO THIS AN ANTI AUTHORITARIAN QUALIT IT'S VERY STRONG YOU GET YOU GET TO SEE THAT THROUGH THEM IF THEY LIKE MOD SARD AND SOFT STREIN QUARTETS THERE'S SOMEBODY THE KIND OF VALUE SOFTNESS AND TRANQUILLITY IN PEACE AND YOU'RE NOT LIKE THAT SO THE MUSIC KIND OF SHOWS YOU SOMETHING EQUALITY ABOUT THEIR CHARACTER THAT CAN BE VERY TELLING ME BE VERY ELOQUENT AND SO IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU BOTH HAVE TO LOVE THE CLASH OR THE DEAD KENNEDIES OR WHATEVER SHOWING MY OWN GENERATION I BUT THAT YOU BOTH HAVE THAT REBELLIOUS STREEK AND THAT REBELLIOUS STREET COULD BE YOU LIKE THERE'S CLASSICAL MUSIC COMPOSERS WHO CAN BE PRETTY DAMN REBELLIOUS AND ANGRY YOU KNON'T I ACT KIND OF LIKE THEM SO THAT CONVERGENCS I THINK I'S A POSITIVE ONE I THIN BUT IN GENERAL I AGREE WITH THAT CURIOUS ABOUT THE NON VERBAL COMMUNICATION COMPONENT OF ALL TYPES OF RELATIONSHIPS BUT WHAT STAY IN THE LANDSCAPE OF ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS FOR THE MOMENT MAYBE INCLUE PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIPS TOO BECAUSE WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED IS REALLY ABOUT A RESIDENCE AROUND THE NON VERBAL STUFF AMEN IT CAN BE ARTICULATED WITH WORDS YE I LOVE ANIMALS I LOVE THIS MUSIC THAT'S THE BEST SONG LIKE DID YOU SEE THAT LIKE OTTERS ARE AMAZING RIGHT THIS KIND OF THING BUT LANGUAGE IS JUST AN ATTEMPT TO PLACE YOU KNOW WORDS ON A FEELING IN THOSE INSTANCES SO IT IT CAN BE CLASSIFIED AS TAT NONVERBAL M WITH RESPECT ANON VERBAL COMMUNICATION O WI YOU'VE WRITTEN VERILY EXTENSIVELY ABOUT THE FACT THAT PEOPLE OFTEN COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR BODY AND FACIAL EXPRESSIONS UM I'M CERTAINLY FAMILIAR WITH THE SOMEWHAT IF NOT VERY ERY SENSACION OF SOMEBODY UM SMILING LIKE AN TOUTHY SMILE AND THEN IT AS THEY PIVOT AWAY THAT SMILE GIST DISSOLVING VERY QUICKLY AND U YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A NOROL SCIENTIST OR PSYCHOLOGIST OR REALIZE AT LIKES THERE WERE SOMETHING QUITE FALSE ABOUT THAT EXPERIENCE OR THAT THIS PERSON EXPERIENCES UM EMOTIONS LIKE STEP FUNCTIONS ON OFF ON OFF WHICH IS NOT HOW MOST OF US EXPERIENCED OF MOCIONS MOST OF US EXPERIENCED MOTIONS WITH SOME PERVASIVENESS LIKE I WAS HAPPY WALKING IN THE DOOR BECAUSE OF SOMETHING HAPPENED BEFORE AND SOME ONE O SMILE WHILE I'M WALKING IN THE DOOR I SEE SOMETHING SHOCKING AND DISMAYING OF COURSE I'MIN A FROWN I'MAN A WIPE AWAY THAT SMILE BUT THOSE ARE RARE INSTANCES SO UM U'S TALK ABOUT THE MOUTH THE EYES THE FACE THE BODY IN THE CONTEXT OF COMMUNICATION WHAT IT WHATAR SOME IMPORTANT THINGS OF H THANN THO D I HAVE GONE TO GO BACK ON AS FAR AS CONVERGENCE IS SENPLY F HUMOR AS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT RIGHT SO SOMD LIKE YOU BOTH LIKE THE SAME COMMEDIENTS BUT IF ONE PERSON LIKES RONCHA HUMOR IND THE OTHER PERSON DOESN'T THAT'S THAT'S A PROBLEM AND ALSO THE FACT THAT THE PRERSON DOESN'T HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR OR DOES IT MAKE YOU LAUGH IS A VERY VERY BAD SCIENCE I WANTED TO ADD THAT ONE COMPONED IN THERE I'M SO GLAD YOU DID A SOMEONE WHO CAN MAKE ME LAUGH HAS A YOU KNOW NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT BUT BOY IT'S A APPROACHING SUFFICIENT YAI  O UM YOU KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO THE ART OF SEDUCTION THE ART OF SEDUCTION IS A NONVERBAL LANGUAGE THAT YOU MUST MASTER IT'S HA LANGUAGE OF THE GIFTS THAT YOU GIVE IT'S A MAT IT'S A LANGUAGE OF OF HOW YOU SMELL IT'S HA LANGUAGE THAT YOU TRANT THAT YOU COMMUNICATE THROUGH THE EYES ET CETERA ET CETERA AND THE THING YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE HUMAN BEING IS THAT WE EVOLVED FOR MUCH LONGER PERIOD OF TIME WITHOUT WORDS THEN THE SMALL FORTY THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND YEARS THAT WE HAVE SYMBOLIC LANGUAGE SO DURING THAT VAST PERIOD OF DARKNESS FOR WE DID NOT HAVE WORDS WE WERE NON COMMUNICATING NON VERBILY W WERE PICKING UP SIGNALS FROM PEOPLE WE WERE WATCHING EVERY LITTLE DETAIL OF THEIR BEHAVIOUR BCAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE WORDS TO DECIPHER IT SO IT'S WIRED INTO OUR BRAINS TO HAVE AN AMAZING SENSITIVITY TO PEOPLE'S NON VERBAL COMMUNICATIONS WE CAN ALMOST BE TELAPATHIC THAT WAY IF WE LEARN THAT LANGUAGE THE PROBLEM IS WE HAVE THE CAPACITY BUT WE DON'T DEVELOP IT AT ALL BECAUSE WE ARE SO WORD ORIENTED YOU'RE JUST LISTENING TO PEOPLE IF YOU'RE EVEN LISTENING TO THEM AT ALL YOU JUST HEARING THE WORDS AND YOU'RE SO THINKING THAT THE WORDS MEANS OF THE WORDS ARE SINCERE WHICH THEYARE OFTEN NOT AT THE SAME TIME THAT YOU'RE LISTENING SO MUCH TO WORDS PEOPLE ARE SHUFFLING IN THEIR CHAIR THEI'R KIND OF LOOKING AWAY THEIR LOOKING AT OTHER WOMEN OR OTHER MEN THEIR VOICE IS KIND OF TREMBLING WHEN THEY SAY SOMETHING THAT WHER IT SHOULDN'T TREMBLE THEIR EYES ARE DEAD THE SMILE IS KIND OF IC YOU'RE NOT WATCHING ANY OF IT SO THE MOST PORTANT THING INNONVERBL COMMUNICATION LAW NUMBER ONE I'S PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT CONTINUALLY DEVELOP THE PRACTICE OF SHUTTING OFF THE WORDS AND WATCHING PEOPLE ALMOST AS IF YOU TOOK THE TEL OF ISN AND MUTED IT RIGHT AND JUST WATCH THEIR BEHAVIOUR IT'S NOT EASY IN IT'S NOT NATURAL BECAUSE IT'S THE WORDS THE WORDS WERE WORDS WE WANTE WANT A FOCUS ON THEM RIGHT BUT YOU'RE ABILITY TO TURN THAT TEL OFISH NOT TO MUTE IT WE'LL SUDDENLY OPEN UP SO MANY THINGS ABOUT PEOPLE THEY REVEAL SO MUCH THINGS SIGMAN FOR IT THAID PEOPLE ARE CONTINUALLY OOZING OUT ALL THEIR SECRETS THROUGH EUR NONFORBEHAVIOR YOU CAN READ THEM LIKE AN OPEN BOOK IF YOU MASTER THIS LANGUAGE AND I HAVE THE LAWS OF HUMAN NATURE I DESCRIBE THE STORY OF MILTON ERICSON I DEARN'T IF YOU FAMILIA WITH MILTON ERIGON PERHAPS THE GREATEST MODERN MASTER OF NONVERBLE  COMMUNICATION HE WAS A AN AMAZING PSYCHOLOGIST HE SORT OF AM I'S THE INSPIRATION BEHIND AM AN WHAT'S THE CALLED ENHELP ME OUT HERE NARRO LINGUIDSTIC OH THE AN ANLPE A MAN TIK A'S CUT UP A BASTORIZATION OF HIS IDEAS BUT HE'S HE CRITTED HYPNOTHERAPE HE'S THE PERSON OF CREAT HYPNOTHERELY I I HYPNOTHERAPE AS AS A VALID PSYCHIATRIC PRACTICE EN ITS EXCELLENT CLENICAL DATAS WELL MILTON ERICSOND HAD POLEO WHEN HE WAS NINETEEN AND HE WAS PARALYZED HIS ENTIRE BODY WAS PARALYZED HE COULDN'T EVEN MOVE HIS EYEBALLS RIGHT AND HE SAT IN BED AND HE HAD A VERY ACTIVE MIND AND HE WAS GOING TO DIE FROM SHEER BORED HIM AND WHAT HE DID DURING THE TWO YEARS OF BEING PARALYZED LIKE THAT WAS JUST WATCHING PEOPLE'S ANONVERBLE COMMUNICATION AND MAKING NOTES IN HIS BRAIN AND LEARNING EVERY SINGLE HE LEARNED THE TWENTY DIFFERENT FORMS OF YES THE HUNDRED DIFFERENT FORMS OF NO RIGHT EVERY INTONATION HOW SERENBODY ENTERED THE ROOM HOW THEY LEFT THE ROOM YOU KNOW HOW THEY LOOKED AT HIM WITH THE PITY OR AMPHITHEOR TAI HE MASTERED IT AND THEN WHEN HE BECAME A PSYCHIATRIST AND HE TREATED PEOPLE THEY THOUGHT HE WAS PSYCHIC HE COULD SEE EVERYTHING INTO THEM IT'S BECAUSE FOR TWO YEARS THAT'S ALL HE COULD DO WAS OBSERVED THEM HE COULDN'T SPEAK HE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING COULDN'T READ A BOOK SO YOU HAVE THAT SAME POWER BUT YOU DON'T HAVE POLO OBVIOUSLY BUT YOU HAVE TO FIRST PAY ATTENTION TO IT RIGHT ITS AN AMAZING THING WANCE YOU DO IT'S A LOT OF FUN ACTUALLY AND I TELL PEOPLE GO TO A CAFE W ONE DAY IN YOUR CITY WHEREVER YOU LIVE AND JUST WATCH PEOPLE CAUSE YOU CAN'T HEAR THEM THEIR REFUSE TABLES WAY WATCH THEIR NOBERBLE BEHAVIOUR AS THEY INTERACT AND SEE IF IF YOU PICK UP FUSED FROM THEM AND THERE THINKS THAT ARE SIGNS OF GENUINE EMOTIONS SO FOR INSTANCE AN EXERCISE YOU CAN DO IS YOU GO UP TO SOMEBODY FROM AN ANGLE WHERE THEY CAN'T SEE YOU COMING UP TO THEM AND YOU SURPRISEIN ME GO HEY HEY MIKE WHATEVER THEY TURN TFOR THAT SECOND THEIR EXPRESSION REVEALS HOW THEY REALLY THINK ABOUT YOU YOU'LL DETECT IF YOU CAN PICK UP MICRO EXPRESSIONS AND AND YOU CAN THEY'RE ONLY LIKE ONE ONE FIFTIETH OF A SECOND BUT THEY'RE THERE YOU EXPRESS A KIND AND THEY SMILE YOU CAN SEE THE LITTLE DISDAIN IN THEIR EYES RIGHT THEN THE MASS COMES ON RIGHT OR YOUR TALKING TO THEM THEY'RE LOOKING AT YOU BUT THEIR FEET ARE FACING IN AN OPPOSITE DIRECTION THAT MEANS THAT THEY'RE DYING TO GET AWAY FROM YOU KINNOTHY THESE ARE SIGNALS THAT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY PAY ATTENTION TO THEIR POSTURE WILL TELL YOU EVERYTHING ABOUT THEIR LEVELS OF CONFIDENCE RIGHT ON AND ON AND ON THE FAKE SMILE IF YOU CAN JUST MASTER THE ABILITY TO DETECT THE FAKE SMILE IT WILL GO WONDERS FOR YOU BECAUSE YOU ABLE TO SEE WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO DO IS TO SEE THE PERSON WITH A GENUINE SMILE PARTICULARLY IN ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS SOME ONE WHOSE FACE LIGHTS UP A REAL SMILE LIGHTS YOUR WHOLE FACE UP IT DOES DOESN'T LIGHT YOUR MOUTH THESE PARTS OF YOUR FACE GO UP YOUR EYES GET ALIVE THERE'S LIKE THERE'S LIKE A A NARROW THING GOING ON IN YOUR BRAIN THAT'S CHANGING YOUR WHOLE FACIAL EXPRESSION AND IT MEANS THAT SOME ONE GENUINELY LIKES YOU THEIR GENUINELY INTEREST IN YOU THEIR GENUINELY LAUGHING OR CONNECTING TO YOU MAN IF YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'LL HELP YOU SO MUCH IN THEIR ROMANTIC REALM AND THET IT'LL HELP YOU GET AWAY FROM THOSE TALKSITE PEOPLE THAT ARE CONTINUALLY FAKING INTEREST IN YOU BECAUSE A NARSISIS ATOXIC PERSON THRIVES BY DECEIVING YOU WITH A CHARMING ALLURING FRONT THEY MAKES YOU COME INTO THEIR WORLD THEN THEY CAN HURT YOU THAN THEY CAN DO SOMETHING TO YOU RED THAN THEY HAVE YOU IN THERE IN THERE YOU KNOW IN THEIR TRAP RIGHT SO BEING ABLE TO SEE THAT THEY'D NOT GENUINELY INTERESTED IN YOU THAT THEY'RE FAKING IT WILL HELP YOU AVOID VERY TOIC RELATIONSHIPS AND AS THEY SAID TO YOU I DON'T IF WE WERE HONOR OR NOT BUT DEEP NARSESES HAVE DEAD EYES THEY THEY ALMOST CAN'T HELP IT THEY CAN FACE THE SMILE THEY CAN FAKE EVERYTHING ELSE BUT THE EYES YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO READ IT BECAUSE YOU SAY WHAT ARE DEAD EYES YOU'LL KNOW IT WHEN YOU SEE IT THERE'S NO LIFE IN THEM THEY'RE LIKE LOOKING THROUGH YOU THEY'RE NOT LOOKING AT YOU THEY'RE LOOKING THROUGH YOU WHAT CAN I GET OF YOU YOU'RE WHAT THEY CALL A SELF OBJECT THEY'RE AN OBJECT FOR YOU TO USE AND THAT'S HOW THEY'RE LOOKING AT YOU LIKE THEY WOULD LOOK AT A HAMMER OR SOMETHING YET THEY CONCEPT OF DEAD EYES AND ALSO ALIVE EYES IS SO FASCINATING BECAUSE AM AS AUDIENCE OF THIS PODCAST WILL KNOW THAT CAUSE IE SAID IT TOO MUCH BUT I'LL SAY IT AGAIN THAT THE EYES ARE THE ONLY TWO PIECES OF YOUR BRAIN THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE CRANIAL VAULT IMA AN THEY'RE LITERALLY TWO PIECES OF BRAIN LINING THE BACK YOUR EYE AN THE DYNAMICS OF THE PUPILS THOSE CHANGES OF COURSE REFLECT HOW BRIGHT OR DIM IT IS IN THE ROOM BUT THEY ALSO REFLECT LEVELS OF A ROWSAL THAT SHAT ON THE MILLA SECOND TIMESCALE SO AS ONE EXPRESSES YOU KNOW WORDS OF A OF GLEE THAT THE PUPILS CONSTRICT A LITTLE BIT BELIEVE YOU'RE NOT I EXCUES ME DILATE A LITTLE BIT I GOT IT BACKWARDS THERE FOR A MOMENT UM AND VICE VERSA YOU KNOW AS ONE FEELS U LESS LESS EXCITED UM  SORT OF MOMENTS OF DESPAIR EXPRESSIONS OF DESPAIR THE PUPIL SHOU GET A LI BUT SMALLER BECAUSE AROUSAL IS GOING DOWN AND SO I THINK YOU KNOW WE PICK UP ON THESE THINGS THAT A UNCONSCIOUS LEVEL WE DO UM THE DEADNESS OF THE EYES AS IS KIND OF THE THE UM THE THE CONCLUSION THAT HAT POPS OUT AT US IF WE'RE PAYING ATTENTION BUT THE PROBLEM IS IT LEVEREGISTERS UNCONSCIOUSLY BUT WE DON'T GIVE IT ANY VALUE TO IT WE TRUST OUR WORDS WE TRUST T OUR RATIONALITY IS SUPPOSED TO OUR INTUITIONS ABOUT PEOPLE SOMETIMES WHEN YOU MEET A PERSON FOR THE FIRST TIME SIGNALS GO UP IN YOUR MONTBRIN SOMETHING'S WRONG ABOUT THEM THEN YOU FORGET IT BECAUSE YOU DON'T TRUST THOSE INITIAL UNCONSCIOUS SIGNALS THAT YOUR BRAIN IS GIVING YOU RIGHT SO YOU HAVE TO WE HAVE THE FIRST KIND OF TRUST THAT TA THAT THESE INTUITIONS ARE VERY VALUABLE THE OTHER THING IS PAY DEEP ATTENTION TO THE TONE OF VOICE THE VOICE AS ACTORS WILL TELL YOU IS LIKE THE HARDEST THING TO FAKE RIGHT IT'S VERY HARD TO FAKE EXCITEMENT YOUR VOICE EITHER HAS IT OR A DOZEN IT'S VERY HARD TO FAKE CONFIDENCE AND YOU CAN I MEAN BOOKS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT THE RNACAN GO INTO ALL THAT THE DETAILS ABOUT IT BUT THE PERSON WILL REVEAL SO MUCH OF THEIR EMOTIONAL OF THE EMOTIONS AT THEIR EXPERIENCING PARTICULARLY LEVELS OF CONFIDENCE AND YOU KNOW LIKE A TREMBLING VOICE OR SOMETHING OR A BOOMING CONFIDENT VOICE WHICH SOME PEOPLE CAN FAKE BUT OFTEN IS VERY DIFFICULT YOU CAN STILL SEE THROUGH IT AND ON THE LEVEL OF SEDUCTION WOMEN MEN ARE VERY VERY ATUNE TO THE VOICE OF WONE BUT WERE NOT AWARE OF IT BECAUSE THE VOICE OF OUR MOTHER HAD AN INCREDIBLE IMPACT ON US IN EARLY EARLY EARLY CHILDHOOD HER SINGING HER THE TONE OF HER VOICE THAT WAS PROBLY THE FIRST SEDUCTION THAT WE EVER WENT THROUGH AND A WOMAN'S VOICE HAS TREMENDOUS POWER OVER US RIGHT AND SO HEARING A VOICE THAT KIND OF GRATSER IRRITATES YOU IS IS SOMETHING THATS AT'S A BAD SILEN ECHOS DEEPER THAN ALL THE CHARACTERSS THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT BUT A WOMAN'S VOICE THAT KIND OF REMINDS YOU OF THAT MOTHER THAT SING SONG YE WHATEVER FEELING WAS THAT'S THAT'S SOMEBODY  THAT CAN VERY UASILY SEDUCE YOU THERE'S A AM THERE'S A PLACE FOR A NAMING THIS OF IT'S LIKE SUBCORTICAL COURTSHIP H NO YOU DON'T BELOW THE QARTAC AS I HAE THE GUNERAL SCIENTISTS LIKE MYSELF SAY YOU KNOW Y UGETTING DOWN BELOW THE QUARTICS WITH ALL OF THIS STUFF YOU KNOW CONVERGENCE OF OF REAL A LOVES AND DESIRES I MEAN T WE EXPRESS WITH WORDS WE SENSE THE WORLD USING A COURSE AR CARTECS BUT REALLY TELL YOU NO GETTING INTO THE THE SUBCORTICAL STUFF THAT IS THE STUFF OF OUR HISTORY THE STUFF OF OUR A HARD WIRING AND OUR UNIQUE OUR UNIQUENESS I COULDN'T HELP BUT THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT EARLIER WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THAN NOW YOU INFINATELY VAST NUMBER OF CHOICES OF THINGS TO ENGAGE IN PEOPLE TO ENGAGE WITH ET CETERA BUT AT THE SAME TIME AS YOU WERE NOW TALKING ABOUT A THES MICHROINFLECTIONS AND THE SUBTLETIES OF VOICE AND BODILY COMMUNICATION THAT WHETHER OR NOT IT'S EMOGIS OR PEOPLE SENDING FILTERED IMAGES OR THE DEFAULT TO TEXT MESSAGE COMMUNICATION THAT IS SO PROMINENT NOW IT SEEMS LIKE WE NOW HAVE MORE CHOICES SO A MORE INPUT BUT THE SORT OF QUALITATIVE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE IMPUTS HAVE BEEN BEND INTO A COUPLE OF SIMPLE BINS AS IF IT'S AS IF WE'VE A REGRESS TO PRIMARY COLORS ONLY A BUT THE CANVASES HUGE OR MAY I DO'T NOFF THAT ANALOGY WORKS BUT YET YOU YOU GET THE IDEA BECAUSE ULTIMATELY IN ORDER TO DEVELOP GOOD CHOICES ABOUT PROFESSION ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS FRIENDSHIPS YOU NEED A LOT OF EXAMPLES AND A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT ALLOWS YOU TO GLEAN THE SUBTLETY ABUT AS LONG AS IT'S AMOGIES AND FILTER PICTURES TAKEN AT A PARTICULAR ANGLE YOU KNOW USUALLY FROM ABOVE ASK FOR THE PICTURE HEAD ON AND BELOW SEND ME A PICTURE OF YOUR WORST YOUR WORST EXPRESSION OF ALL OF THAT A IT SEEMS THAT THERE'S NOW INCREASED OPPORTUNITY FOR DECEPTION AND I DON'T JUST MEAN PEOPLE MISLEADING OTHERS I ALSN'T MEAN US MISLEADING OURSELVES I OH MY GOODNESS HOW COULD I BE SO DISAPPOINTED YET AGAIN ABOUT PARTICULAR LANDSCAPE OF LIFE ATD DOESN'T JUST HAVE TO BE ROMANTIC INTERACTIONS IT CAN BE OTHER LANDSCAPES LIKE HOW COULD I BE FOOLED WELL YOURE FOOL BECAUSE F IT THE A THE INPUTS WERE DEFICIENT NOT GOOD DATA AS WE SAY WELL THE THING IS IF THINGS ARE ER YOURE IMERSED IN THE VIRTUAL REALM IT'S VERY VERY HARD TO MASTER THE NONVERBAL COMMUNICATION ASPECT WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT SO IF YOU'RE DATING FROM AN AP AND YOUR FLIPPING THROUGH AND THEN YOU FIND THAT PERSON YOU'VE MISSED OUT ON THE GREATEST EXPERIENCE OF LIFE WHICH IS ACTUALLY HAVING TO GO OUT TO A BAR OR GO TO A RESTAURANT OR GO TO A SOCIAL EVENT AND HAVE TO LITERALLY ENCOUNTER ANOTHER PERSON AND DEAL WITH LOOKING AT THEIR THAT THEIR BEHAVIOR AND KIND OF ASCESSING WHO THEY ARE IT'S A MUSCLE THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO NONVERBLE COMMUNICATION AND IF YOU'RE JUST YOU KNOW GOING THROUGH THE IMOGIES OR GOING THROUGH THE TINDER APS THAT MUSCLE COMPLETELY ATRIPES YOU HAVE NO POWER YOUE NOT ABLE TO DECIPHER ANYTHING AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE USING THESE APS A SOCIAL SKILLS ARE LIKE ANY SKILL AT ALL THEY YOU HAVE TO DEVELOP THEM IT'S A MUSCLE YOU HAVE TO DEVELOP AND YOU'VE ALL NOTICED THIS PROBALY IN YOUR OWN LIFE IF YOU'VE GONE THROUGH A PERIOD WHERE YOUR KIND OF RETREAT YOU DON'T WANT TO BE AROUND PEOPLE AND YOU SPEND A MONTH LIKE THAT AND THEN YOU GO OUT YOU FEEL AWKWARD IT TAKES YOU LIKE COUPLE DAYS TO GET USED TO BEING AROUND OTHER PEOPLE YOU SAY STUPID THINGS YOUR BODY LANGUAGES AWKWARD BUT IF YOU'RE IN A SITUATION FOR MONTHS WHERE YOU'R CONSTANTLY INTERACTING PEOPLE YARE OND A FILMSET IN DAY AND DAY OUT DEAP THAT SKILL STARTS DEVELOPING BUT YOU HAVE TO BE OUT THERE IN THE WORLD YOU HAVE TO BE INTERACTING YOU HAVE TO BE LO OKING AT PEOPLE'S EMOTIONS YOU HAVE TO BE GAGING THEM IN REAL TIME WE'RE NOT BUILT FOR VIRTUAL IN COUNTERS WERE CREATURES OF HUMAN OF FLESH AND BLOOD AND WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT EACH OTHER IN THE EYE AND PAYING ATTENTION TO ALL THESE LITTLE DETAILS THESE NEW ANCES THAT YOU CAN ONLY GET IN PERSON ALONL THOSE LINES O WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT A EYE AND HOW THAT'S GOING TO SHAPE OUR I'M SENSE OF SELF SENSE OF OTHERS AND RELATIONSHIPS AS IF THAT'S A TOPIC THAT COULD BE A COVERED IN A A SERIES OF MINUTES BUT WHAT AT WHAT ER AM WHAT YOUR TOP CONTOR MAY BE EVEN DEEPER THOUGHTS ABOUT A I WELL I'M GOING TO A WUL EPISTOLOT OF PEOPLE OFF BUT I'M I'M KINDVERY CONCERNED ABOUT IT I'M I MENTIOND BEFORE ABOUT ANXIETY THE RULE THAT ANXIETY PLAYS IN THINKING YOU COME UPON AN IDEA AND YOU GO YET THAT'S A GOOD THEN YOU GO TO THE NEXT LEVEL AND BECOMES BETTER THAN YOU GO ON WAY BE THAT'S NOT SO GOOD THEN YOU GO TO THE NEXT LEVEL YOU AE TO LEVEL THREE AND IT GETS BETTER AND BETTER YOU HAVE ANXIETY ANOTHER ASPECT OF INTELLIGENCE IS SELF AWARENESS RIGHT THE BE TO LOOK AT YOURSELF GO I HAVE BIACES I HAVE CONFIRMATION BYUS I HAVE CONVICTION BY US I HAVE RECENCY BIUS I HAVE TO COUNTERACT THESE THINGS I ALSO HAVE A DARK SIDE I HAVE AGGRESSION I AVE TO BE AWARE OF HOW THEY COLOR MY THINKING MY EMOTIONS THE THIRD QUALITY THAT GOES INTO A TELL I'M GOING ABOUT NOW INTELLIGENCE NOT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THE BEAL TO DEAL ANXIETY AND GO TO THIRD LEVEL INTELLIGENCE S THE BUALL TO LOOK AT SIDT OF YOURSELF AND SEE YOUR OWN BIACES AND THE THIRD THING IS THE ABILITY TO SEE A WHOLE ISTIC PICTURE THE KIND OF A HAW MOMENT THAT SCIENTIS HAVE WERE YOU ACCUMULATE ALL KIND OF DATA POINTS AND THE OUT OF NOWHERE AN IMAGE COMES TO YOUR MIND OF YET THERE'S THE ANSWER YOU SEE THE WHOLE THING YOU SEE THE WHOLE GISTALL RIGHT SEMON VILE COMPARED IT TO I A A A SQUARE CUBE YOU CAN ONLY SEE A CUBE FROM ONE SIDE OR YOU CA NEVER SEE US A A SQUARE CUBE YOU CAN ONLY SEE A SIDE OF IT IF IT'S ROTATING YOU STILL ONLY SEEING SIDES OF IT ONLY IN YOUR MIND CAN YOU PICTURE THE WHOLE THING SO THE MIND HAS TO GO THROUGH A PROCESS TO HAVE WHOLIS STIC THINKING IF THEY CAN INVENT A MACHINE THAT CAN DEAL WITH ANXIETY AND HAS ANXIETY AND CAN GO TO LEVEL THREE IF THEY CAN MAKE A MACHINE THAT CAN BE SELF AWARE THEY CAN GO THE PEOPLE WHO PROGRAMM ME HAVE BIACES THEREFORE I HAVE BIACES I ALSO HAVE A DARK SIDE BECAUSE PEOPLE HAFE PROGRAMM YOU HAVE A DARK SIDE IF THIS MACHINE CAN ALSO THINK WHOLEISTICALLY BEYOND ALL THE DATA POINTS IND ALL THE MASS OF INFORMATION THAT'S COMBINE ING CAN HAVE THAT A HAW MOMENT ALL RIGHT I CAN SEE A HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS I CAN SEE CREATIVITY THERE THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS WHEN I WAS THE STUDENT AT BERKELEY GOING AWAY BACK I WAS NINETEEN YEARS OLD I DECIDED ONE SUMMER WIS IS A BIG PARADIME SHIP FOR ME I MAY TAKE THIS CLASS AN ANCIENT GREEK IN SIX WEEKS THEY TEACH YOU A YEAR OF ANCIENT GREEK THAT MEANS EVERY DAY YOU HAVE AN EXAM EVERY FRIDAY YOU HAVE A FINAL EXAM EIGHT HOURS EVERY DAY OF A DEAD LANGUAGE I THOUGHT THIS TO BE THE BEST DISCIPLINE FOR ME AFTER SOME ONE WHO BEEN DON'T BEEN DOING TOO MANY DRUGS TO BE ONCS WITH YOU OHEAND SO FINELY AT ONE POINT THEY GIVE US THIS PARAGRAPH OF THE HARDEST ANCIENT GREEK RIDER OF ALL TO REED THIS WAS NEAR THE END FUCIDITIES OR THRUG KIDITIES AS THEY SAY I STARE ASO I HADT I HAD LIKE THE WHOLE NIGHT TO TRYING TRANSLATE ONE PARAGRAPH I COULDN'T FIGURE IT OUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE WEIRDNESS OF ANCIENT CREEK ALL THE ENDINGS THE WEIRDWAYST OF THINKING THE WHOLE PICTURE THAT A HAWMOMENT WAS ELUDING ME AT ONE POINT I THOUGHT I GOT IT AND I TRANSLATED IT AND I GAVE IT TO THE TEACHER NEXT DAY I REMEMBER HOS THIS KIND OF HIPPY THAT YOUD HAVE A BERKELEY DENIS CLASSICS PROFESSOR BUT ALSO A HIPPY IF AT THE AN NEW IS FIRST NAME IS VERAY I ONT ONLY REMEMBER HIS FIRST THAMG DEN H'S YE SAID ROBERT I CAN SEE YOU'R THINKING BUT YOU NEEDN'T GO TO ANOTHER LEVEL YOU MISSED YIT DIDN'T HAVE THAT A HOMMOMET YOU DIDN'T PUT THE WHOLE THING TOGETHER YOU WERE CLOSE BUT YOU DIDN' YOU HAVE TO TRY HARDER AND THAT STRUCK IN MY MIND FOR EVER LIHT WHENEVER I HAVE A PROBLEM I HAVE TO THINK HARDER I HAVE TO GO TO THAT NEXT LEVEL NOW WHAT WOULD HAPPENED IF I HAD PULLED OUT MI TRANSLATION OF THU CITIES AND JUST COPY THAT OUT RIGHT O WHAT HAVE HAPPENED IF I' PUT IT THROUGH CHAT G P T AND IT GAVE ME THE TRANSLATION THAT MUSCLE IN MY BRAIN THAT I HAVE DEVELOPED FOR FORTY YEARS THAT ALLOWS ME TO WRITE BOOKS WOULD NEVER HAVE DEVELOPED AND THAT MUSCLE IS I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER HERE I HAVE TO GO TO ANOTHER LEVEL I HAVE TO TRY HARDER I HAVE TO THINK I HAVE TO THINK IAVE AV THAT ENGINE WHIRRING AROUND RIHT BUT IF I JUST GRAT FOR CHATG B T IT'S DEADENED AND THEY YOU CAN HAVE A WHOLE GENERATION IF PEOPLE WHO STOPPED THINKING WHO DON'T GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS YOU KNOW YOU'VE HEARD DOUGLAS HOSHDETTER I THING HE SAID PEOPLE TRAIN TO GO TO MOUNT EVEREST IT TAKES MONTHS PHYSICAL EXERTIONS PAINFUL THEN THEY CLIMB OUT EVERS THEY SEE THE TOP WHO WHAT A GREAT MOMENT YOU SAID CHATCH B T BE THEQUILLING OF TAKING A HELLECOPTOR TO THE TOP OF MOUNT EVERAS WITHOUT ANY OF THAT TRAINING AND HAVING THE SAME MOMENT IT'S NOT THE SAME RIGHT YOU NEEDN'T GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS YOU YOU O GO THROUGH THAT PAIN AND IF YOU JUST AND THE THING OF IS CHATCHE BE TE ME THINK WE'RE SO MODERN AND SO SOPHISTICATED BUT REALLY WERE JUST SEDUCED BY MAGIC YOU PUT IT IN THERE YOU SEE SCRRO WO IT'S LIKE MAGICS LIKE A MAGICIAN BUT IT'S EMPTY IT'S LIKE NOT YOUR BRAIN FUNCTIONING RIGHT IT'S PAY IT'S THE PAGAN PART OF US WE LIKE THAT KIND OF MAGIC I SUPPOSED TO ACTUALLY HAVING TO GO TO THE THOUGHT PROCESS ITSELF SO I'M ONFIT AGAINST HAVING TOOLS I USE TOOLS I USED THE INNERNAT I U SCHOOL I SEARCHING FOR LIKE SOME FACT TOYED FROM MY BOOK I FIND IT I USE THAT I I LIKE IT BUT I'VE ALSO LEARNED TO DEVELOP MY BRAIN TO THINK TO GET THAT ENGINE CONSTANTLY MOVING AND I'M DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT  PEOPLE WHO CAN'T LEARN TO FOREIGN LANGUAGE WHO CAN'T MASTER ANYTHING WHO JUST IMMEDIATELY GRAB THE FIRST ANSWER THAT IT GENERATES ET CETER ET CETERA I HAVE CONCERNCE I AM TOO AND I WAS THINKING A MOMENT AGO THAT YOU KNOW LIKE SOME PEOPLE MIGHT HEAR WHAT YOU JUST SAID AND SAY OH WELL THE SAME THING WAS PROUADLY SAID ABOUT THE AUTOMOBILE LIKE HOW MANY AMAZING A EXPERIENCES OF WALKING FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER ARE GOING TO BE LOST WHEN PEOPLE START DRIVING FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER BUT I THINK A KEY DIFFERENCE AND THIS CERTAINLY LINES WITH EVERYTHING YOU JUST SAID IS THAT WHAT YOURE TALKING ABOUT IS NOT JUST ARRIVING AT THE SAME DESTINATION YOURE SAYING THE DESTINATION ITSELF IS DIFFERENT WHEN ONE EXERT SOME EFFORT AND EXPERIENCES SOME ANXIETY TO GET THERE SO IT'S NOT THE SAME AS AUTOMOBILE VERSES HORSE VRSES WALKING VIRS AS AEROPLANE IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT BECAUSE THE THE JOURNEY TRANSFORMS THE OUTCOME YYEI I'VE BEEN AGREEMENT WITH YOU ABOUT MANY ASPECTS OF A EYE AM ALSO EXCITED ABOUT IT IN THE CONTEXTS OF CERTAIN THINGS ANDE AGREE WITH YOU IT COULD BE A TOOL BUT ARE WE OPERATING THE TOOL ORS THE TOOL OPERATING US IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT I AM  CONCERNED A BIT TO ESPECILLYING THE CONTEXT OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR MOST OF TODAY'S DISCUSSION ABOUT A AVATARS REPLACING OUR ONLINE PERSONAS TOO MUCH AM YOU KNOW THET AVATARIZATION OF OURSELVES HAS ALREADY TAKING PLACE THROUGH THROUGH FILTERS THROUGH A REDUCTION OF EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION TO EMOGIES THROUGH REDUCTION OF OF LANGUAGE TO A DIMINISH NUMBER OF WORDS TO EXPLAIN ONE'S FEELINGS YO A PRIOR GUEST ON THIS PODCAST A LEAST A FHELDMAN BERRET WHO'S AN EXPERT IN EMOTIONS TALKED ABOUT HOW THE MOMENT THAT A CULTURE HAS A WORD FOR PARTICULAR SUBSET OF ANXIOUS FEELINGS SO FOR INSTANCE SHE TAUGHT ME THAT IN JAPANESE THERE'S A WORD FOR THE SADNESS ONE EXPERIENCES WHEN THEY GET A BAD HAIRCOT I NO NOAND SO THAT NORMALIZES THE FEELING AND LEADS TO FEELINGS OF LESS DESPAIR AS SOPPOSED TO WHAT NOW MANY KIDS ESPECIALLY GREW UP LEARNING WHATS I'M ANXIOUS I'M SAD I'M DEPRESSED THAT YOU KNOW IN SIENCE WE SAY THERE ARE LUMPERS IN THEIR R SPLITTERS AND THEY'VE BEEN ARGUING FOR YEARS ABOUT LIKE AS THAT ONE BRAIN STRUCTURE WILL FIN NAME THOSE TWO THINGS NEXT TO EACH OTHER TO DIFFERENT THINGS NOT ONLY CAN I NAME ONE AFTER MYSELF WHICH IS WHAT TENDS TO HAPPEN SO TO SPEAK BUT WHEN YOU HAVE TOO MANY LUMPERS OR TOO MANY SPLITTERS THINGS ARE EITHER OVERLY SIMPLE OR OVERLY COMPLEX THAT OF COURSE THE RIGHT ANSWER THAT THE THE BEST USE OF NAMING THINGS ARRIVE SOME PLACE IN THE MIDDLE THAT'S HOW A FEELD PROGRESSES CAUSE IF YOU IF YOU LUMP THINGS TOGETHER TOO MUCH A FEELD CAN'T PROGRESS IU YOU GIVE THE YOURSELF THE ILLUSION THAT IT'S PROGRESSING BUT IT'S NOT PROGRESSING BUT IF YOU SPLIT THINGS UP INTO A MILLION DIFFERENT SUBCATEGARS LIKE JUST EVEN THE WORD A DRANOLIN IS ALSO CALLED APINEFERON AND THAT'S THAS TO DO WITH BASILY PEOPLE ARGUING OVER WHO GOT CREDIT CRAZY AND IT'S CONFUSED PEOPLE FOR FIR DECADES YE AND THERE'S THERE'S ANOTHER STORY THERE THAT I NOT KNOW FAR TOO MUCH ABOUT THE SCIENTISTS INVOLVED AND THAT THERE WAS A LOVE TRIANGLE ABOUT NAMING OF CERTAIN PARTS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OH YAT PEOPLE SLEEPING WITH OTHER PEOPLES PARTNERS AND LOVE TRIANGLES HAVE HAVE CREATED MORE DRAMA AF NOMING CLATER IN SCIENCE I COULD DO A HO HOUR ON THIS A IN ANY CASE I WHAT I'M HEARING FROM YOU IS THAT WE CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE OUR SENSE OF NEW AUNTS AND ALSO BECAUSE THAT SENSE OF NEW AUNTS TAPS INTO WHAT WERE REALLY EXPERIENCING AND E I THREATENS THAT THAT WE CAN BECOME AVATARS OF OURSELF LOOK IT IT THIS WAY WE WE WORSHIP TACNOLOGY IT'S OUR NEW RELIGION OUQE AND WE WORSHIP CAGIPITS IF IT'S A GOD SERIOUSLY THERE'S RELIGIOUS ELEMENTS GOING ON HERE WELL WE REALLYSHIP WORSHIP IS THE HUMAN BRAIN WHICH IS THE GREATEST CREATION IN THE KNOWN UNIVERSE I AM AFRAID IT IS THE MOST COMPLEX PIECE OF MATTER IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE THE NUMBER OF NURANCS THE NUMBER OF SENAPS AS THE NUMBER OF POSSIBLE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN NURANS IS INFINITE PRACTICALLY INFINITE IT IS A WONDROUS INSTRUMENT IT IS SO POWERFUL WE WEVE FAIRLY SCRATCHED THE SURFACE OF WHAT WE CAN USE FOR IT LET US WORSHIP THAT BRAIN THAT'S IN YOUR HEAD YOU ONLY HAVE SO MANY YEARS TO USE IT YOU HAVE AL SO MANY USED TO DEVELOP IT IT IS SO WONDERFUL AND POWERFUL THAT CAN BRING YOU SUCH PLEASURE SO MUCH POWER IN LIFE SO TOOLS ARE FINE WE ALL NEED TOOLS WE ALL NHE ME HAMMERS WE NEED NAILS WE NEED SAWS ET CETERA BUT THE REAL THING IS THE HAND THAT USES IT THE BRAIN THAT CONNECTS THE HAND TO THE HAMMER THAT KNOWS HOW TO HIT THINGS YOU KNOW I THINK OF THE OF THE A THE GREAT PAINTER RENOIR THE NINETEENTH CENTURY HE HAD LIKE A A STROKE OR SOMETHING THAN THE LAST YEARS HE COULDN'T MOVE HIS RIGHT ARM WHICH W SHE PAINTED WITH IT WAS DISASTROUS SO WHAT HE DID IS HE PUT THE BRUSH IN HIS MOUTH AND HE PAINTED AND HE PAINTED SOME BEAUTIFUL PAINTINGS THAT WAY BECAUSE HIS BRAIN HAD MASTERED THE ART OF PAINTING NOT HIS HAND BUT HIS BRAIN AND MASTERED SO WELL THAT HE COULD ACTUALLY PAINT WELL WIT THE BRUSH IN HIS MOUTH BECAUSE HE COULD DIRECT IT HE HAD THE KNOWLEDGE OF HOW TO MAKE SOMETHING PERFECT THE BRAIN IS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE THE PLASTICITY OF THE BRAIN WHICH I AM DISCOVERING AFTER MY STROKE IS ABSOLUTELY A MIRACLE YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW IS PROFESSOR SCHWARTZ YOU SE A LA WHO IS STUDYING O C D AND HOW HE WAS ABLE TIS KIND OF CURE PEOPLE OF O C D THROUGH CERTAIN PLASTICITY EXERCISES THAT HE HAD MAKING THEM AWARE OF THEIR KIND OF BRAIN LOCK ET CETERA AND GETTING THEM OUT OF IT THE THAT PLASTICITY OF THE BRAIN IS FAR FAR THE GREATEST MIRACLE OF ALL AND HEAD GOES ON INTO YOUR S IXTIES IN SEVENTIES AN ON ONWARD LET'S ALL GET DOWN OUR HANDS AN KNEES AND WORSHIP THE BRAIN AND IF WE DID IT WOULD CREATE A COMPLETE SHIFT IN OUR VALUES AND WE WOULDN'T BE SO INSTANTLY SUDUCED AND ENAMORED AND WORSHIPPING THE TECHNOLOGY WE WOULD WORSHIP THE BRAINS THAT CREATE THE TECHNOLOGY INSTEAD OF YOU KNOW THE OTHER WAY AROUND ICERTAINLY GOT A FAN OF BRAINS AND THEIR A POTENTIAL FOR PLASTICITY SITTING OVER HERE A I HAVE THE BENEFIT OF HAVI MY G SCIENTIFIC GREAT GRANDPARENTS ARE HE WON VEASAL WHO WON THE NOBLE PRIZE FOR NER PLASTOSEE DURING THE CRITICAL PERIS  THIT GAN SO MY SCIENTIFIC GREAT GRANDPARENTS ARE DAVID HUBLL AND TORN SOME VEASAL DAVID'S DEAD TORNSTANC SO LIVE HES NINETY SIX AND THEY WON THE NOBLE PRIZE FOR ESSENTIALLY DISCOVERING THE CRITICAL WINDOW EARLY N DEVELOPMENT WHERE PLASTICITY IS ESPECIALLY ROBOST THEY DID OTHER THINGS TO THEY SHOULD HAVE WON TWO NOBELLS FRANKLY A FOR THEIR OTHER WORK ON VISION BUT AM ONE THING THAT THEY MISSED HOWEVER WAS SOMETHING THAT YOU MENTIONED AND IS WORTH A HIGHLIGHTING AGAIN WHICH IS THAT THE BRAIN MAINTAINS THE CAPACITY FOR IMMENSE PLASTICITY THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE LIFE SPEND PLEAYS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THE CONDITIONS CHANGE FROM EARLY TO LATER IN LIFE BUT YOUR SPECIFIC SITUATION REALLY HIGH LIGHTS THAT AND IT'S SOMETHING I REALLY LIKE TO A TALK ABOUT FOR A FEW MINUTES IF IF YOU'RE WILLING AM AS YOU MENTION YOU EXPERIENCED A STROKE AM AND PERHAPS A IT WAS AWARE TO SOME BUT PERHAPS NOT TO ALL ESPECIALLY THE PEOPLE JUST LISTENING TO THIS PODCAST AND WHO ARE NOT WATCHING ON VIDIO THAT OM YOUR SHIRT WHILE VERY NICELY DESINED  IN IN ITS ORIGINAL STATE ALSO INCLUDES SOME UNIQUE STITCHING SO MAYBE YOU COULD SHARE WITH US A WHAT AND FOR THOSE LISTENING THERE'S A THERE'S A JAGGED A LINE OF STITCHING THAT A EXTENDS FROM A ROBERTS A LEFT SHORT SLEEVE TO HIS MIDLINE TO WHERE THE BUTTONS ON A SHIRT ARE AND FROM THE FROM HIS RIGHT SHORT SLEEVE ALSO TO THE MIDLINE OFFSET FROM ONE ANOTHER THESE AM THIS IS THE SORT F STITCHING THAT LOOKS LIKE PERHAPS I HAD BEEN AT THE SOWING MACHINE OM AND NOT SOMEBODY WIT A SKILLBODY THEY DID A GAD JOB BASICALLY PUTTING BACK TOGETHER WHY ARE THOSE DITCHES IN YOUR SHIRT TELL US ABOUT THE STROKE AND LET'S LET'S TALK ABOUT NEROW PLASTICITY IT COULD ALSO SEEMD LIKE A FASHION STATEMENT YOU KNOW BUT IT REALLY IT ISN'T AM WELL IT WAS MADY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY AND MY WIFE GAVE ME THIS SHIRT I HAVE A LOVE OF PLATS IT'S LIKE I DON'T KNOW WHY I JUST LOVE PATTERNS AND PLATSI MUST BE LIKE SOME SCOTCH PART OF ME SOME ANCESTR THING BUT I LOVE PLATS CAN I INTERRUPT YOU JUST BRIEFLY FORGIVE ME EVER ONCE WHN TO GET UPSET THA INTERRUPT DO YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS A FUNDAMENTAL CIRCUIT IN YOUR VISUAL QARTAX DESIGING TO DETECT PLAD T PATTERNS NO I DID NOT YES AND WE YON TALK ABOUT WHA THAT IS IT I'S TIGHTLY TIGHTLY LINKED TO YOUR ABILITY TO PERCEIVE MOTION REALL AGAIN WE CAN GO OVER IT SOME OTHER TIME BUT AH YE SO WELL TO ME MI JUST AS A CU SO O CA  GES BAD TO YOUR BIRTHDAY SO SHE GAVE ME A PLATCHER KNOWING HOW MUCH I LOVED IT AND I LOVED THIS SHIRT I LEFT THE COLOURS IN IT ET CETER ET CETERA AND THEN TWO MONTHS THREE MUSTHSLETTER AUGUST SEVENTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN I WAS DRIVING MY CAR SHE WAS WITH ME I WAS PULLING OUT INTO TRAFFIC AST ORT OF DRIVING AND SUDDENLY SHE SAY PULL OVER OVER PULL OVER WHY WHY I CAN DRIVE I'M FINE AND THEN SUDDENLY EVERYTHING STARTED GETTING REALLY STRANGE EVERYTHING LOOKED STRANGE MY VOICE DIDN'T SOUND THE SAME AND SHE WAS LIKE FREEKING OUT BUT SHE WAS ACTUALLY FAIRLY COM WHICH WAS AMAZING I WAS UNDERGOING A STROKE I HAD A BLOOD CLOT THAT WAS BLOCKING THE BRANT THE BLOOD FLOAT IN MY BRAN I ACTUALLY ONE PONE GOT OUT OF THE CARD LIKE I WAS I DON'TKNOW WHAT THE HELL I WAS THINKING AND THEN SHE PULLED ME BACK IN THAN THE REST GOES BLANK AND I HAD SOME WEIRD SENSATIONS THAT STILL REMAIN WITH ME BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY I WAS ON THE VERGE OF DYING BECAUSE BLOOD NOT FLOWING TO YOUR BRAIN IS BASE ILY THE END OF YOU RIGHT UNLESS SOMETHING HAPPENS VERY QUICKLY AND SHE ATHER THAT OR YOU CAN GET SEVERE BRAIN DAMAGE SO SHE CALLED MINE WHEN ONE RIGHT AWAY SHE RECOGNIZED SOMETHING MY WHOLE FACE WAS LOOKING FUNNY AND THEY GOT THERE I WAS UNCONSCIOUS AND ESSENTIALLY THEY TOOK THIS SHIRT AND JUST SIZERED THE THING IN HALF AND TOOK IT OFF MY HEAD AND THEN THEY INTIBATED ME I BELIEVE IN MY HIPBARIA TO GET SOMETHING THE BLOOD CLOD WAS IN MY NECK AND THEY WERE ABLE TO FREE IT UP AND THEY RUSHD ME THE HOSPITAL AND I'M UNCONSCIOUS AND THEN IM I WAKE UP AND I'M IN A GURNIY IN THE HOSPITAL AND I DON'T FOR A MOMENT I THINKI MAY BE I'M DEAD BECAUSE I'M LYING IN A GURNIN AND ALMOSTY LIE I'M IN A COFFIN I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON ND I HAVE ALL OF THESE WEIRD SENSATIONS AND I I TELL PEOPLE WE'RE SO CURIOUS ABOUT DEATH WE THINK ABOUT DEATH TO LOT AND YOU KNOW IS IT FINAL WHAT DOES IT MEAN WE REALLY SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO DYING DYING IS ACTUALLY MUCH MORE INTERESTING IN SOME WAYS THAN DEATH AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIED GO THROUGH A PROCESS IF IF IT'S LONG ENOUGH AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCES LIKE I DO HAVE GONE THROUGH THAT PROCESS OF DYING AND HAVE COME BACK TO LIFE AND IN THE PROCESS OF DYING STRANGE THINGS HAPPENED TO THE BRAIN RIGHT SO PARTICULARLY WITH A STROKE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHERE BLOOD STOPS FLOWING TO YOUR OXTION STOPS FLOWING TO YOUR BRAIN YOU HAVE KIND OF VISIONS AND THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT THINK OUR HALLUCINATIONS BUT THAT LATER SEEM LIKE ACTUALLY YOU ARE ACTUALLY GLIMPSING THE REALITY AS SUPPOSED TO THE ILLUSION TOT THE BRAIN CREATES SO I'VE WRITTEN ABOUT THIS IN MY NEW BOOK BUT IM MY IDEA OF THE BRAINS THAT IT CREATES ENDLESS SERIES OF ILLUSIONS FOR YOU IT CRE ATES THIS SEEMLESS VERSION OF REALITY THE SENSE OF A SELF THE SENSE OF A CONTINUOUSSELF THROUGH TIME RIGHT IT CREATES A LINEAR SENSE OF TIME PROGRESSIONS IT CREATES COLSECRATES A WORLD THAT VISUALLY YOU CAN SEEMS FAMILIAR AND ET CETERA CETERA BUT IT'S ALL ILLUSION IT'S ALL A CONSTRUCTION RIGHT IMAGES COME INTO YOUR BRAIN AND THEY'RE NOT ORGANIZED IN ANY WAY AND THE BRAIN ORGANIZES IN A WAY THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND IT WELL WHEN YOU'RE DYING ALL OF THAT SCRAMBLES UP AND YOUR ACTUALLY OR SEEING SOMETHING ELF SO I SAW FOR INSTANCE THAT I REALLY DON'T HAVE A SELF THAT IT DOESN'T REALLY ACTUALLY EXIST THAT I AND THE IMAGE THAT CAME TO MY MIND CAUSE IT WAS IN SITTING IN THAT GERNE WAS THE WEIRD FEELING OF LIKE I CAN ALMOST NOT EXPLAIN IT BUT IT'S AS IF YOU TOOK AN IMAGE OF SOMETHING REAL IN THE WORLD AND YOU COMPLETELY SCRAMBLED IT UP AND IT WAS ALL WAVY AND YOU COULDN'T SEE WHAT EXACTLY IT WAS THELL ME THAT WAS THE IMAGE I HAD OF THE SELF THEY ARE LIKE FIFTY DIFFERENT SELVES INSIDE OF YOU THAT ARE ALL COMPETING AND YOU THINK THERE'S JUST ONE AND YOU THINK IT'S CONSISTENT BUT THERE'S NOT IT'S AN ILLUSION THE SELF IS LITERALLY INUSION THAT YOUR BRAIN CONSTRUCTS WHEN YOU'RE DYING YOU SEE THESE THINGS WHEN YOU'RE DYING YOU SEE OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT YOU SEE THAT TIME IS SOMETHING VERY WEIRD SO I HAD EXPERIENCE OF WHEN I GOT OUT OF THE CAR NAGA PULLED IN I THOUGHT LIKE TEN SECONDS AN PAST MY WIFE TOLD ME NO THOSE JUST THAT WAS LIKE TEN MINUTES I HAD NO SENSE OF TIME EVERYTHING WAS SCRAMBLED AND SO IT WAS VERY VERY ELOGUUT TAUGHT ME SO MUCH THINGS THAT I CAN I CAN BARELY EVEN EXPRESS NOW I'M ALWAYS NOW THINKING OF STRANGE THINGS THAT COME TO ME BECAUSE MY BRAIN WAS DAMAGED IT MADE ME REALIZE THAT THE BRAIN CREATES EVERYTHING SO I CAN'T COMMUNICATE WITH MY HAND MY FINGERS I CAN'T COMMUNICATE MY BRAIN CAN'T COMMUNICATE WITH MY LEG RIGHT SO YOU THINK THAT WALKING AND WRITING AND HANDLING THINGS IS JUST YOUR YOUR BODY OPERATING CERTAINWAY IT'S YOUR BRAIN TELLING YOU HOW TO MOVE THESE DIFFERENT THINGS WHEN THAT BRAIN STOPS FUNCTIONING YOU REALIZE HOW MUCH YOUR BRAIN DETERMINES EVERYTHING IT ALL STARTS THERE AND WHEN THERE'S DAMAGE TO YOUR BRAIN YOUR WHOLE THINKING ALTERS ET CETERA NOT TO MENTION HOW YOU LOOK AT LIFE ITSELF AFTER SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO IT WAS A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE IT'S RUIND SO MANY THINGS THAT I LOVED IN LIFE BUT IT'S GIVEN ME AN AWFUL LOT AS WELL IN RETURN THAT I COULD GO ON FOR HOURS AND TALK ABOUT BECAUSE IT WAS THE MOST POWERFUL EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE WHEN YOU WERE GOING THROUGH YOUR REEMERGENCE TO CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE HOSPITAL DID YOU FEEL AS IF YOU WERE OBSERVING THESE MULTIBLE VERSIONS OF YOURSELF  MAYBE DIFFERENT WAY TO PHRASE IT IS DID YOU FEEL YOU WERE SOR BEHIND THE CIRCUIT BOARD THAT IS YOUR BRAIN OBSERVING HOW YOU NORMALLY FUNCTION AND YOU COULD SEE MULTIBLE VERSIONS OF SELF OR WAS IT SOMETHING ELSE WHERE YOU SERVE OUTSIDE OF YOUR BODY AND BRAIN I THINK IT WAS MORE OUTSIDE OF MY BODY AND BRAIN I ALSO HAD THIS OTHER THING THAT HAPPENED WERE I DON'T YOU KNOW SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T REMET YOUR MEMORY MIGHT BE PLAYING TRICKS ON YOU SO I'VE ALSO HAVE TO REALIZE THAT MAYBE I'M NOT REMEMBERING EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED OR THAT I'VE SINCE TRANSLATED IN A DIFFERENT WAY SO THAT'S A CAVIOT HERE AND I'M AWARE OF IT BUT I HAD THIS VISION THAT I WAS DEAD ENAT FIRST WHEN I FIRST BECAME CONSCIOUS AND THAT I WAS UP IN THE SKY AND I WAS LOOKING DOWN AND MY MOTHER AND MY WIFE WERE TALKING AND SLIKE OVER MY GRAVE I SUPPOSE AND HAD THIS FEELING AH EVERYTHING'S O KAY I'M GONE BUT LIFE GOES ON THEYRE THEY'RE DOING FINE IT'S SO KAY RIGHT SO I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT SENSE OF SELF WHETHER IT WAS LIKE I'M AWARE OF IT HAPPENING BUT I HAVE A FEELING IT WAS SOMETHING FROM THE OUTSIDE I DON'T REALLY KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT BECAUSE IT'S VERY CONFUSED THE OTHER FEELING I HAD WAS LIFE WHEN I AV HAVING THE STROKE WAS LIFE DRAINING OUT OF ME AND MY BONES GETTING SOFTER AND SOFTER AND SOFTER AND I CAN'T REALLY LOGICALLY EXPLAIN THAT THE FEELING OF BONES SOFTENING UP AND DISSOLVING BUT FOR WEEKS AND MONTHS AFTERWARDS I COULD ACCESS THAT FEELING OF MY BONES DISSOLVING AT CEDERAE T WAS A FEELING OF ALL YOUR ENERGY DRAINING OUT OF YUIN YOUR DYING LITERALLY SO UM READING BOOKS ABOUT NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCES AS A LOT OF WHAT I'M BE PART OF MY NEXT BOOK GODDESS IS FASCINING IR SO MANY INTERESTING THINGS TO GO INCAUSE IT TEACHES US SO MUCH I'M SO GLAD EH YOU SURVIVED YOUR STROKE BE THAT YOUR MENTAL FACULTIES NOT MORE GRATEFUL THAN I IA PROBABLY NOT BUT STILL VERY GRATEFUL SO THERE JUST AM ILLUSTRATES HOW GRATEFUL YOU MUST BE AM BE THAT YOU'VE MAINTAINED IF NOT GROWN YOUR MENTAL FACULTIES O MANY SEEM EXTREMELY SHARP I PROMISE YOU YOU'RE NOT MISSING A BE A YOU KNOW ONE ALWAYS WONDERS RIGHT I THALD ONE OF THE MOST COMMON FEARS PEOPLE HAVE AS THAT SOMEHOW THEY'RE LOSING THEIR MIND OR THEIR MEMORY AND PEOPLE ARE AND THEY AREN'T AWARE OF IT I YOU KNOW HEARE I FAMILY MEMBERS WHO HAVE ASKED THAT IF THEY EVER STARTE TO EXHIBIT SIGNS OF SEVERE TO MEN SHA THAT I UM WELL PUT AN END TO THEM WHICH I WON'T AM THAT'S NOT MY PLACE IN THIS WORLD A BUT I THINK IT'S A COMMON FEAR AMONG AMONG PEOPLE BUT YOUR STILL EXTREMELY SHARP AND THANK GOODNESS FOR IT AND AND YOU MENTION THAT UM WHELE YOU'VE LOST CERTAIN ABILITIES THAT NOW APPRECIATION AND NEW ABILITIES HAVE SURFACE UM CYOU PERHAPS SHARE WHAT SOME OF THOSE ARE AND AND WHAT TH MEAN TO YOU U BECAUSE I THINK THAT WHEN ONE HEARS ABOUT SOMEBODY HAVING A STROK WE TEND A FOCUSS ON WHAT'S WHAT'S LACKING BUT CLEARLY THIS HAS BEEN A TRANSFORMITIVE EXPERIENCE ALSO IN POSITIVE WAYS WELL I HAD TO CONFRONT SOME OF MY OWN DEMONS I HAD TO CONFRONT THE SENSE THAT  I EXPECTED THINGS OUT OF LIVE AND HERE I'M THE'RE TAKEN AWAY AND IM I'MI'M KIND OF UNGRATEFUL FOR BEING ALIVE AND HERE I'M PISTOFF THAT IT TAKES ME TEN MINUTES TO TIME MY SHOES AND I CAN'T REALLY BUTT IN MY SHIRT I HAD TO LEARN BUT REALLY MATTERS AND TO HAVE PATIENCE AND STUFF THE OTHER THING WAS I USED TO LOVE HIGHKING AMS VERY PHYSICALLY ACTIVE AND I'M SITTING AT MY WINDOW IN MY OFFICE AND SEE PEOPLE RUNNING UP AND DOWN ICICLING WALKING THEIR DOG GOD I'M SO ENVIOUS IF I HAD IF I COULD WALK A DOG RIGHT NOW I' BE THE HAPPIEST PERSON ALIVE BUT THEN I GO THROUGH A THOUGHT PROCESS WHICH MAYBE ISN'T COMPLETELY HEALTHY WHICH IS THEY'RE NOT AWARE OF HOW WONDERFUL IT IS JUST TO WALK A DOG BUT I'M AWARE OF IT SO WHEN I GO OUT IN MY BACK YARD AND I CAN'T WALK AND I'M SEEING LIKE I KNOWS IT'S GOING TO SOUND REALLY TREACLY AND SET TO MENTAL BUT I SEE YOU KNOW BUTTERFLIES OR THINGS IN MY GARDEN I'M LIKE WAL THAT'S INCREDIBLE YOU KNOW THINKS LIKE THAT THAT I I COULDN'T APPRECIATE BEFORE BECAUSE I'M I'M SEDETARY AND I CAN'T MOVE I HAVE TO SUDDENLY PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT'S AROUND ME NOT TAKE IT FOR GRANTED AND FINE AND SUCK ALL THE PLEASURE OUT OF IT THAT I CAN SO NOW WHEN I SIT AT MY DESK TO WRITE MY NEW BOOK IT'S FOUR HOURS AS IT'S ALL I CAN STAND MAYBE THREE SOMETIMES THOSE FOUR HOURS ARE LIKE SUCH BLISS FOR ME I TRULY APPRECIATE IT NOW BECAUSE I KNOW THAT MY BRAIN WAS ALMOST GONE RIGHT SO IT MEANS SO MUCH FOR ME AND IT JUST BE ALIVE YOU KNOW IS IS IS IS THIS S A WONDROUS EXPERIENCE I HAVE A CHAPTER MY NEW BOOK CALLED AWAKENE TO THE STRANGENESS OF BEING ALIVE AND IT'S ABOUT THE FACT THAT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT AND HOW UNLIKELY IT IS THAT WE HUMANS EVOLVED AT ALL EVEN THAT WE EVEN EXIST ALL THE BOTTLE NEXT ANEVOLUTION THAT WE HAD TO PASS THROUGH INCLUDING THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE DYNA SORS IN THE EMERGENCE OF MAMALS BUT THEREARE TWENTY OTHER HUGE BOTTLE NEXT THROUGHOUT THE HISTORY OF EVOLUTION WE HAD TO PASS THROUGH ALL OF THOSE WE NEARLY WENT EXTINCT EIGHTY THOUSAND YEARS AGO FROM SOME VIRIS THAT INFECTED THERE ONLY EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE HUMANS ON THE PLANET ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS AND HERE WE ARE WITH ZUME MEETINGS ET CETER ET CETERA IT'S LIKE THE STRANGEST STORY YOU CAN EVER IT'S BEYOND SCIENCE FICTION BUT NOBODY THINKS ABOUT NOODY SITS DOWN I GOES GOD I'M ALIVE IF YOU WENT BACK TO THE CHAIN OF PEOPLE THAT HAD TO CONNECT AND HAVE CHILDREN LEADING UP TO YOUR PARENTS THE UNLIKELINESS OF YOU EVER BEING BORN IS ASTRONOMICAL AN UNLESS MY SCIENCE IS ALL WRONG YOU KNOW SEVENTY THOUSAND GENERATIONS OF PEOPLE MEETING ET CETER ET CETERA FINALLY YO ENDING AT YOUR DIONE I MEAN OT UNLESS IM MISSING SOMETHING IT'S IT'S PRETTY UNLIKELY BUT NOBODY THINKS ABOUT IT WILE I CERTAINLY THINK ABOUT IT NOW BECAUSE I ALMOST DINET I HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO THINK ABOUT UTS I HAVE TO ENTERTAIN MY BRAIN THE WAY MILTON ERICSON HAD TO ENTERTAIN HIMSELF BY OBSERVING PEOPLE SO IT'S TAKEN A LOT AWAY FROM ME I CAN'T SWIM I'M WRITING MY MY RECUMBENT BIKE WHICH I LOVE AND EIGHT YEAR OLD GRANDMOTHERS ARE ZIPPING BY ME AND GOT HOW AWFUL I SO ENVIOUS I'M SO MY INSECURITIES ALL WELL UP BUT THEN I RIS HEY I IM LIKE I  LIKE ON A BOAT I'M SAILING IT'S WONDERFUL I'M OUTSIDE U KNOW I HAVE TO GO THROUGH THESE PROCESSES BUT I THINK IT'S DEVELOP ME IN SOME WAY THAT'S TES IN THE END VERY POSITIVE TI'LL THINK YOU'VE HAD TO ADJUST TO A NEW FRAME RATE ON LIFE LIKE THAT THE THE OLD MOVY HAD A CERTAIN FRAME RATE THIS MOVY HAS A CERTAIN FRAME RATE BUT THAT WITHIN THAT FRAME RATE THEREARE GIFTS TO BE HAD THAT YOU CERTAINLY MISSED IN YOUR PRIOR VERSION OF SELF THAT THAT AYAV BUT ALSO LIKE I TELL PEOPLE THIS I TOTALLY TOOK MY LIFE FOR GRANTED I I WAS SWIMMING ALL THIS TIME I WAS FANTASTIC I WAS PISYCLLING I WAS TRAVELLING BUT I NEVER SET BACK AN THOUGHT WHILE THIS IS WONDERFUL HOW GRATEFUL IT IS COULD BE TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU I TELL PEOPLE DON'T DO THAT TO YOURSELF I TRY TO TEACH THEM IT CAN BE TAKEN AWAY FROM TO MORROW WHEN YOU ARE OUT WALKING THE DOG THINK OF ME THINK OF ME THAT CAN'T WALK A DOG AND APPRECIATE THOSE THINGS WHICH I DIDN'T APPRECIATE SO I TRY AND HELP PEOPLE IN THAT WAY WHEN I CAN YOU KNOW I I THINK A CRITICAL MESSAGES ALSO TO INSPIRE A SENSE OF URGENCY IN PEOPLE YOU KNOW I THINK PEOPLE HERE SENSE OF URGENCY AND THE H I 'M ALREADY UNDER SO MUCH PRESSURE LIFE SO HARD BUT WE'RE NOT TALKING BOUT A SENSE OF URGENCY TO TAKE ON MORE OF WHAT LIFE HAS TO OFFER A I THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A SENSE OF URGENCY TO FINE ONE'S PURPOS WHICH TAKES WORK AND IS AN ON GOING PROCESS BUT TO REALLY GET OUT OF MODES OF APATHY LAZINESS A LANGUISHING AND TO START AS YOU'VE DESCRIBED IT PAYING DEEPER ATTENTION I MAYI THIS IS A A CONCEPT THAT WAS SUPERIMPORTANT FOR ME TO HEAR ABOUT AND I LEARNED ABOUT IT FROM YOU WAS HOW DO YOU GET YOURSELF OUT OF A RUT YOU START PAYING DEEPER ATTENTION TO THE THINGS AROUND YOU AND INSIDE YOU AND UM PEREHAPS NOT COINCIDENTALLY YOU REFERRED TO THAT AS QUOTE DEATH GROUND YE SO UM IT'S WHAT IT'S THE STRATEGY FROM MY BOOK IA ROTER BOOK ON STRATEGY MY VERSION OF THE ART OF WAR CALLED THIRTY THREE STRATEGIES OF WARWARDS REALLY ABOUT STRATEGY THE STRATEGIC THINKING IT'S INSPIRED FROM SUN SOO TA GREAT CHINESE STRATEGIST BUT IT HAS VAST PHILOSOPHICAL IMPLICATIONS THE IDEA IS YOU CAN ALMOST THINK OF IT LIKE BARAMETRIC PRESSURE WHEN NECESSITY IS PRESSING IN ON YOU LIKE YOUR BACK IS AGAINST THE WALL LIKE YOU HAVE TO GET SOMETHING DONE AND THERE'S LIKE THIS PRESSURE AROUND YOU YOU FIND ENERGY IN TH THAT YOU NEVER BELIEVED BEFORE WILLIAM JAMES TALKS ABOUT THIS AND EN HE TALKS ABOUT GETTING A SECOND WIND I EXPLAINS IT VERY ELOQUENTLY WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR LIFE'S IN DANGER SUDDENLY YOU CAN YOU CAN LEAP OVER THINGS THAT YOU NEVER COULD LEAP OVER BEFORE SO SONSU SAYS PUT AN ARMY ON DEATH GROUND AND IT WILL FIGHT AND TILL IT'S IN WINDS MEANING PUT AN ARMY WITH ITS BACK TO THE OCEAN OR A BACK TO THE MOUNTAIN AND IT'S EITHER WIN OR DIE THERE CAN A FIGHT TEN TIMES HARDER YOURE GIN TO FIND THE ENERGY IN YOU THAT YOU NORMALLY LACK WHEN DEATH IS FACING YOU IN THE FACE OR URGENCY OR DEAD LINES OR PEOPLE PRESSING IN ON YOU WHEN THAT BARRAMETRIC PRESSURE LOOSENS UP AND THERE'S NONE OF IT YOU THINK YOU HAVE ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD YOU GET NOTHING DONE WELL MAN I'M TWENTY THREE I'VE GOT ALL THESE YEARS AHEAD OF ME ELL GON A FIGURATE OUT RIGHT I'M NOT GOING TO DIE I'VE GOT FIFTY SEVENTY EIGHTY YEARS AHEAD OF ME NO YOU DON'T THAT PRESSURE NOW IS GONE AND YOUR WASTING TIME YOU YOU'RE YOUR DOING ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT AREN'T LEADING TO ANY KIND SKILL YOUR NOT LEARNING OR ANYTHING YOU NEED TO PUT YOURSELF ON DEATH GRINTING YOU TO FEEL THAT BARAMETRIC PRESSURE WHICH IS THE ACTUAL REALITY THE ACTUAL REALITIES YOU COULD DIE TO MORROW YOU CAL HAVE A STROKE TO MORROW YOUR YOU COAL BE FIRED TO MORROW EVERYTHING COULD FALL APART YOU NEED TO HAVE THAT SENSE OF URGENCY NOW BECAUSE THAT'S THE REALITY YOU'RE FOOLING YOURSELF BY THINKING YOU HAVE ALL THIS TIME AND SO WHEN YOU FEEL THAT PRESSURE SUDDENLY YOU CAN MOVE MOUNTANS YOU YOU HAVE ENERGY YOUR LIFE YOU KNOW THAT HOU JUST HAVE FOCUS ET CETERA NEUROLOGICALLY EVERYTHING CLICKS IN YOU KNOW AND PEOPLE WHO'VE HAD THAT EXPERIENCE WHERE THEYE WHERE THEY FELT LIKE THAT THE SHIP WAS GOING ON DER AND THEY BETTER GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER AND SURVIVE THEY TALK ABOUT ALL THESE PHYSICAL PROCESSES I HAVE A STORY IN MY NEW BOOK I NOT BORING HIM O L B THET QUITE THE OPPOSITE ABOUT A MOUNTAIN CLIMBER WHO O HE E HE WAS CLIMBING THIS MOUNTAIN BY HIMSELF AND HE WAS HAVINT A GREAT TIMAT OS A STORM COMING AND HE HAD TO GET DOWN AND HE SUDDENLY FELL AND HE CUT HIS LEG OPEN MASSIVELY AND IT WAS LIKE A BRANCH STICKING IN IT AND HE BROKE ALL THESE BONES AND HE WAS USE  ADIE HEE'S ON A LEDGE HE COULD SEE THAT IT WAS GETTING DARK AND AND STORM CLOUDS WERE WERE MASSING THEMS CAN BE WAS IN THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS HE WAS ALONE AND SUDDENLY HE MANAGED TO GET UP ON HIS TWO FEET AND HE CAN'T EXPLAIN HOW BUT ALL OF THIS ENERGY ALL THIS ENDRENANT STARTED FLOWING IN THEM ANDHE SAID HE WAS LIKE A MOUNTAIN GOAT HE WAS LIKE GOING DOWN THE LEDGE HE JUMPED HE WAS ABLE TO KIND OF GET DOWN TO ANOTHER LEDGE HEIS HE GOT IT HE GOT OUT OF IT AND FOR FOR THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS IT WAS HAUNTED BY HOW DID THAT HAPPEND I WANT THAT FEELING AGAIN BECAUSE IT WAS ACTUALLY THE MOST ECSTATIC FEELING I HAD ENERGY THAT I NEVER SUSPECTED IN MYSELF AND SO HE TRIES EVERYTHING TO GET THAT FEELING BACK HE TRIES CLIMBING OTHER MUNTH HE TRIES GOING TO TO MOUNT EVER IF HE TRY THAT AND IT DOESN'T COME BACK AND FINALLY HE THOUGHT KIND OF FIGURES OUT FORMULA FORT AND WHY IT HAPPENED HE STUDIES A LOT OF NEURO SIDES IT'S A GREAT BOOK I' MUSIC IN MY NUWBOOKITS CALLED BONE BONE GAMES 'S VERY INTERESTING BOOK A LOT OF SIDES IN IT I AND HE GOT THE FEELING BACK IN IS SMALLER SENSE BUT IT WAS THE FEELING OF YOUR LIFE IS IN DANGER I BETTER GET MY ACT TOGETHER OR IT'S THE END AND SUDDENLY A DRANOLEN DOPAMIN ALL THE OTHER THINGS WERE CURRING IN HIM AND HE GOT ND HE FOUND THAT ENERGY SO I THAT'S THAT'S THE ULTIMATE KIND OF DEATH GROUNDRIGHT THERE THE HUMAN WILL TO LIVE IS TRULY INCREDIBLE AND SEN I HAVE TO SAY AS I SAID BEFORE I'M SO GRATEFUL THAT YOUR STROKE DIDN TAKE YOU OUT BECAUSE CLEARLY THERE'S STILL SO MUCH IN THERE

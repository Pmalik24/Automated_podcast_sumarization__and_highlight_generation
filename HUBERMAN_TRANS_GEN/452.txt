WELCOME TO THE HUBERMANO A SCIENCE SCIENCE PACE TO  FOR  I MAENDURHUBERMEN AND ON A PROFESSOR OF NERBIOLOGY AND OPTHOMOLOGY AT STAMFORD SCHOOL OF MEDISIN TO DAY MY GUEST IS DOCTOR DAVID ANDERSON DOCTOR ANDERSON IS A PROFESSOR OF BIOLOGY AT THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY OFTEN COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS CALTEC UNIVERSITY DOCTOR ANDERSON'S RESEARCH FOCUSES ON EMOTIONS AND STATES OF MIND AND BODY AND INDEED HE EMPHASIZES HOW EMOTIONS LIKE HAPPINESS SADNESS ANGER AND SO ON ARE ACTUALLY SUBCATEGORIES OF WHAT ARE GENERALLY GOVERNED BY STATES THAT IS THINGS THAT ARE OCCURRING IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM IN OUR BRAIN END IN THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN BRAIN AND BODY THAT DICTATE WHETHER NOT WE FEEL GOOD ABOUT HOW WE ARE FEELING AND THAT DRIVE OUR BEHAVIORS THAT IS BY US US TO BE IN ACTION OR INACTION AND STRONGLY INFLUENCE THE WAY WE INTERPRET ARE EXPERIENCE AND OUR SURROUNDINGS TODAY DOCTOR ANDERSON TEACHES US FOR INSTANCE WHY PEOPLE BECOME AGGRESSIVE AND WHY THAT AGGRESSION CAN SOMETIMES TAKE THE FORM OF RAGE ALSO TALK ABOUT SECUAL BEHAVIOR AND THE BOUNDARIES AND OVERLAP BETWEEN AGGRESSION AND SECUAL BEHAVIOR AND THAT DISCUSSION ABOUT AGGRESSION AND SECUAL BEHAVIOR ALSO STARCH TO FOCUS ON PARTICULAR ASPECTS OF NERAL CIRCUITS AND STATES OF MIND AND BODY THEY GOVERN THINGS LIKE FOR INSTANCE MALE MALE AGGRESSION VERSES MALE FEMALE AGGRESSION VERSES FEMALE FEMALE AGGRESSION SO TODAY YOU WILL LEARN A LOT ABOUT THE BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS THAT GOVERN WHY WE FEEL THE WAY WE FEEL INDEED DOCTOR ANDERSON IS AN AUTHOR OF A TERRIFIC NEW POPULAR BOOK ENTITLED THE NATURE OF THE BEAST HOW EMOTIONS GUIDE US I'VE READ THIS BOOK SEVERAL TIMES NOW UNTELL YOU IT CONTAIN SO MANY GEMS THAT ARE FIRMLY GROUNDED IN THE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IN FACT A LOT OF WHAT'S IN THE BOOK CONTRASTS WITH MANY OF THE COMMON MYTHS ABOUT EMOTIONS AND BIOLOGY SO WHETHER NOT YOUR AUTHERAPIST OR EUROP BIOLOGIST OR EA SIMPLY JUST SOMEBODY INTERESTED IN WHY WE FEEL THE WAY WE FEEL AND WHY WE ACT THE WAY WE ACT I CANNOT RECOMMEND THE BOOK HIGHLY ENOUGH AGAIN THE TITLE IS THE NATURE OF THE BEAST HOW EMOTIONS GUIDE US TO DAY'S DISCUSSION ALSO VENTURES INTO TOPICS SUCH AS MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESS AND SOME OF THE EXCITING DISCOVERIES THAVE BEEN MADE BY DOCTOR ANDERSON'S LABORATORY AND OTHER LABORATORIES IDENTIFYING SPECIFIC PEPTIDES THAT IS SMALL PROTENES THAT CAN GOVERN WHETHER NOT PEOPLE FEEL ANXIOUS OR LESS ANXIOUS AGGRESSIVE OR LESS AGGRESSIVE SINCE AN IMPORTANTAREA OF RESEARCH THAT HAS DIRECT IMPLICATIONS FOR MUCH OF WHAT WE READ ABOUT IN THE NEWS BOTH UNFORTUNATE AND FORTUNATE EVENTS AND THAT WILL NO DOUBT DRIVE THE FUTURE OF MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENTS DOCTOR ANDERSON IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THEMOST PIONEERING AND IMPORTANT RESEARCHERS IN NERBIOLOGY OF OUR TIME INDEED HE IS A MEMBER THE NATIONAL CADEMYA SCIENCES AND A HOWARD HUGE'S MEDICAL INSTITUTE INVESTIGATOR I'VE MENTION THE  CH  OMY ONCE OR TWICE BEFORE WHEN WE'VE HAD OTHER  CH TO MY GUESTS ON THIS PODCAST BUT FOR THOSE WHO ETHER NOT FAMILIAR THE HOWARDS USE MEDICAL INSTITUTE FUNDS A SMALL NUMBER OF INVESTIGATORS DOING PARTIC URELY HIGH RISK HIGH BENEFIT WORK AND IT IS AN EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE PROCESS TO IDENTIFY THOSE HOWARD HUGH'S INVESTIGATORS THEY ARE SENTIALLY APPOINTED THEN EVERY FIVE YEARS THEY HAVE TO COMPETE IGAINST ONE ANOTHER AND AGAINST A NEW IN COMING FLOCK OF WOULD BE ATATIO MY INVESTIGATORS TO GET ANOTHER FIVE YEARS OF FUNDING THEY ARE LITERALLY GIVEN A GRADE EVERY FIVE YEARS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN CONTINUE NOT CONTINUE OR WHETHER NOT THEY SHOULD WORRY ABOUT BEING FUNDED FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME DOCTOR ANDERSON HAS BEEN AN INVESTIGATOR WITH THE HOWARD HUGE'S MEDICAL INSTITUTE SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE BEFORE WE BEGIN ID LIKE TO EMPHASIZED THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROM MY TEACHING AND RESEARCH ROLLS AT STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE AND EFFORTS TO BRING ZERO COSTIC CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELAIED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSOR IS ELEMENT ELEMENT IS AN ELECTOROLITE DRINK WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS PLENTY OF SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM THE SO CALED ELECTROLYTES AND NO SUGAR NOW SALT MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM ARE CRITICAL TO THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS IN YOUR BODY IN PARTICULAR TO THE FUNCTION OF YOUR NERVE CELLS ALSO CALLED NURONS IN FACT IN ORDER FOR YOUR NURONS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY ALL THREE ELECTROLITES NEED TO BE PRESENT IN THE PROPER RATIOS AND WE NOW KNOW THAT EVEN SLIGHT REDUCTIONS IN ELECTROLIKE CONCENTRATIONS OR DEHYDRATION OF THE BODY CAN LEAD TO DEPHISITS IN COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE ELEMENT CONTAINS A SCIENCE BACK TELECTOROLITE RATIO OF ONE THOUSAND MILIGRAMS THAT ONE GRAM OF SODIUM TWO UNDER MILEGRAMS OF POTASSIUM AND SIXTY MILIGRAMS OF MAGNESIUM I TYPICALLY DRINK ELEMENT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAKE UP IN ORDER TO HYDRATE MY BODY AND MAKE SURE I HAVE ENOUGH ELECTROLYTES AND WHILE I DO ANY KIND OF PHYSICAL TRAINING AND AFTER PHYSICAL TRAINING AS WELL ESPECIALLY IF I'VE BEEN SWEATING LOT IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO DRINK ELEMENT THAT'S ELEMENTE DOCOM SLASH HUBERMEN TO CLAIM A FREE ELEMENT SAMPLE PACK WITH YOUR PURCHASE AGAIN THAT'S DRINK ELEMENT ELEEMENT DOCCOM SLASH HUBERMEN AND NOW FOR MY DISCUSSION WITH DOCTOR DAVID ANDERSON DAVID GREAT TO BE HERE AND GREAT TO FINALLY SIT DOWN AND CHAT WITH YOU GREAT TO BE HERE TO THANK YOU SO MUCH I HAVE A TON OF QUESSIONS BUT I WANT TO START WITH SOME THING FAIRLY BASIC BUT THAT I'M AWARE IS A PRETTY VAST LANDSCAPE AND THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EMOTIONS AND STATES IF INDEED THERE IS A DIFFERENCE AND HOW WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT EMOTIONS WHAT ARE THEY THEY HAVE ALL THESE NAMES HAPPINESS SADNESS DEPRESSION A ANGER RAGE HOW SHA WE THINK ABOUT THEM AND WHY MIGHT STATES BE AT LEAST AS USEFUL A THING TO THINK ABOUT IF NOT MORE USEFUL THAT'S GREAT AM FIRST THE SHORT ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS THAT I SEE EMOTIONS AS A TIPE OF INTERNAL STATE IN THE SENSE THAT AROUSALS ALSO A TYPE OF INTERNAL STATE OTIVATIONS OF TYPE OF INTERNAL STATE SLEEP IS A TYPE OF INTERNAL STAPE AND THE  SIMPLEST WAY I THINK OF INTERNAL STATES IS THAT AS YOU'VE SHOWN IN YOUR OWN WORK THEY CHANGE THE IN PUT TO OUTPUT TRANSFORMATION OF THE BRAIN WHEN YOURE ASLEEP YOU DON'T HEAR SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD HEAR IF YOU WERE AWAKE UNLESS IT'S A REALLY REALLY LOUD NOISE SO FROM THAT BROAD PERSPECTIVE I SEE EMOTION AS A CLASS OF STATE THAT CONTROLS BEHAVIOUR THE REASON I THINK ITS USEFUL TO THINK ABOUT IT AS A STATE IS IT PUTS THE FOCUS ON IT AS A NUROBIOLOGICAL PROCESS RATHER THAN AS A PSYCHOLOGICAL PROCESS AND THIS GETS AROUND ALL OF THE DEFINITIONAL PROBLEMS THAT PEOPLE HAVE WITH THE WORD EMOTION WHERE MANY PEOPLE IT QUITE EMOTION WITH FEELING WHICH IS A SUBJECTIVE SENSE THAT WE CAN ONLY STUDY IN HUMANS BECAUSE TO FIND OUT WHAT SOME OF T FEELING YOU HAVE TO ASK THEM AND PEOPLE ARE THE ONLY ANIMALS THAT CAN TALK THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND SO THAT'S HOW I THINK ABOUT EMOTION ITS THE YOU THINK IF YOU THINK OF AN ICEBERG ITS THE PART OF THE ICEBERG THATS BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE WATER THE FEELING PART IS THE TIP THAT SORT OF FLOATING ABOVE THE SURFACE OF YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS NOT THAT THAT ISN'T IMPORTANT IT IS BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND CONSCIOUSNESS IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND FEELINGS AND WERE NOT READY TO STUDY THAT AN ANIMALS YET AND SO THAT'S HOW I THINK ABOUT IT WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF A STATE  YOU KNOW YOU MENTIONED A ROUSAL AS A KEY COMPONENT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER FEATURES OF STATES THAT REPRESENT THIS AS YOU M SO BEAUTIFULLY PUT IN YOUR BOOK THAT REPRESENT BELOW THE TIP OF THE ICE BRIGHT RIGHT SO A YOU CAN BREAK STATES UP A INTO DIFFERENT FASCITS OR PEOPLE WOULD CALL THEM DIMENTIONS AND SO A THERE HAVEBEEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE THOUGHT OF EMOTIONS AS HAVING JUST REALLY TOO DIMENSIONS A AN AROUSAL DIMENSION AAHOW INTENSE IS IT A AND ALSO AVAILANT DIMENSION A WHICH IS IS IT POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE GOOD OR BAD A RALPHADOLFS AND I HAVE TRIED TO EXPAND THAT A LITTLE BIT TO THINK ABOUT COMPONENTS OF EMOTION PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT DISTINGUISH EMOTION STATES FROM MOTIVATIONAL STATES BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY CLOSELY RELATED A ONE OF THOSE IMPORTANT PROPERTIES IS PERSISTENCE A AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT DISTINGUISHES STATE DRIVEN BEHAVIOURS FROM SIMPLE REFLECTS ITS REFLECTES TEND TO TERMINATE WHEN THE STIMULUS TURNS OFF LIKE THE DOCTOR HITTING YOUR KNEE WITH A HAMMER IT INITIATES WITH THE STIMULUS ONSET AND IT TERMINATES WITH THE STIMULUS OFFSET EMOTIONS TEN TO OUTLAST OFFEN THE STIMULUS THAT EVOKE THEM IT YOURE WALKING ALONG A TRAIL HERE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA YOU HEAR A RATTLE SNAKE RATTLING YU CAN A JUMP IN THE AIR BUT YOUR HEART IS GOIN TO CONTINUE TO BEAT AND YOUR PALM SWEAT AND YOUR MOUTH IS GOING TO BE DRY FOR A WHILE AFTER IT SLITHERED OFF IN THE BUSH AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE HYPER VIGILANT IF YOU SEE SOMETHING THAT EVEN REMOTELY LOOKS SNAKE LIKE A STICK YOU'RE GAN A STOP AND JUMP SO PERSISTENCE IS AN IMPORTANT FEATURE AOF OF EMOTION STATES NOT ALL STATES HAVE PERSISTENCE SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU THINK ABOUT HUNGER ONCE YOU'VE EATEN THE STATE IS GONE YOU'RE NOT HUNGRY ANY MORE BUT IF YOU'RE REALLY ANGRY AND YOU GET INTO A FIGHT WITH SOMEBODY EVEN AFTER THE FIGHT IS OVER YOU MAY REMAIN RILED UP FOR A LONG TIME AND IT TAKES YOU A WHILE TO COME DOWN AND THAT MAY HAVE TO DO WITH THE AROUSAL DIMENSION OR SOME OTHER PART OF IT A AND THEN A GENERALIZATION IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF EMOTION STATES A THAT A MAKE THEM IF THEY HAVE BEEN A TRIGGERETE IN ONE SITUATION THEY CAN APPLY TO ANOTHER SITUATION AND MY FAVOURITE EXAMPLE OF THAT IS YOU COME HOME FROM WORK AND YOUR KIT IS SCREAMING IF YOU HAD A GOOD DAY AT WORK YOU MIGHT PICK IT UP AND AND SOOTHE IT IF YOU HAT A BAD DAY AT WORK YOU MIGHT REACT VERY DIFFERENTLY TO IT AND SCREAM AT IT AND SO THAT'S GENERALIZATION OF THE STATE THAT WAS TRIGGERED AT WORK BY SOMETHING YOUR BAW SAID TO YOU TO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT INTERACTION AND AGAIN THAT' SOMETHING THAT DISTINGUISHES EMOTION STATES FOR MOTIVATION STATES MOTIVATION SATES ARE REALLY SPECIFIC FIND AND EAT FOOD OBTAIN AND CONSUME WATER AAND THERE THE'RE INVOLVED IN HOMEOSTATIC MAINTENANCE SO STATES ARE VERY MULTI FASCINED AND JUST ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THESE COMPONENTS OF STATES ARE INCODED LIKE WHAT MAKES A STATE PERSIST WHAT GIVES A STATE A POSITIVE OR INEGATIVE VEILANCE HOW DO YOU CRANK UP OR CRANK DOWN THE INTENSY THE STATE IT JUST OPENS UP A WHOLE BUNCH OF QUESTIONS THAT YOU CAN ASK IN THE BRAIN WITH THE KINDS OF TOOLS WE HAVE NOW YOU MENTIONED AROUSAL A FEW TIMES AND YOU MENTION VEILANCE REALIZING THAT THERE ARE THESE OTHER ASPECTS OF STATES ILIKE TO JUST TALK ABOUT AROUS ALL A BIT MORE AND VEILANCE BECAUSE AT A VERY BASIC LEVEL IT SEEMS TO ME THAT AROUSE ALL WE CAN BE VERY ALERTS AND AN PIST OFF ASTREST WORRIED YOU'VE BINSOM NE A WE CAN ALSO BE VERY ALERT AND BE QUITE HAPPIES OF O THEVEILANCE FLIPS I WE CAN BE VERY YOU PEOPLE CON BE SECTUALLY AROUSED BE WE MBE AROUSED IN ALL SORTS OF WAYS IS THERE ANY SIMPLE OR SIMPLE ISH NEURO CHEMICAL SIGNATURE THAT CAN FLIP VEILANT SOFER INCITS IS THERE ANYWAY THAT WE CAN SAFELY SAY THAT AROUSAL WITH SOME ADDITIONAL DOPAMINE RELEASE IS GOING TO BE OF POSITIVE VEILANCE AN AROUSAL WITH A VERY LOW DOPAMINE IS GOING TO BE OF NEGATIVE VEILANE AH I I WOULD BE RELUCTANT TO SAY THAT IT'S A CHEMICAL FLIP I WOULD SAY ITS MORE LIGKELY TO BE A CIRCUIT FLIP DIFFERENT CIRCUITS BEING ENGAGED IN IT MIGHT BE THAT A GIVEN NEURO CHEMICAL EVEN DOPAMINE IS INVOLVED IN BOTH POSITIVELY VEILANCE TOROUSAL AND NEGATIVELY VEILANCE TO ROUSAL THAT'S WHY PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THESE AS DIFFERENT AXES SO I THINK THE INTERESTING QUESTION THAT THAT YOU TOUCH ON IS IS AROUSAL SOMETHING THAT IS JUST COMPLETELY GENERIC IN THE BRAIN OR ARE THERE ACTUALLY DIFFERENT INDS OF AROUSAL THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO DIFFERENT BEHAVIORS YOU RAISE A QUESTION OF SEXUAL ROUSAL FEELS DIFFERENT FROM AGGRESSIVE AROUSAL FOR EXAMPLE AND WE ACTUALLY PUBLISHED A PAPER ON THIS BACK IN TWO THOUSAND NINE IN FRUITFLIES WHERE WE FOUND SOME EVIDENCE FER TWO TYPES OF AROUSAL STATES ONE OF WHICH IS SLEEP WAKE AROUSAL YOUR MORE AROUSED WHEN YOU WAKE UP THAN WHEN YOURE SLEEP AND FLY SHOW THAT AND THE OTHER IS A A STARTLE RESPONSE AND AROUSAL RESPONSE TO A MECHANICAL STIMULUS A NOXIOUS MECHANICAL STIMULUS IF YOU PUFF AIR ON FLIES KIND LIKE TRYIN TO SWAT THE WASP AWAY FROM YOUR BURGER A PICNIC TABLE THEY COME BACK MORE AND MORE AND MORE VIGOROUSLY AND WE WERE ABLE TO DICECT THIS AND SHOW THAT ALTHOUGH BOTH OF THOSE FORMS OF AROUSAL REQUIRE DOPAMNE THEY WERE THEY WERE EXERTED THROUGH COMPLETELY SEPAERABLE NERL CIRCUITS IN THE FLY AND SO THAT REALLY PUT NUMBER ONE THE EMPHASIS ON ITS THE CIRCUIT THA DETERMINES THE TYPE OF AROUSAL BUT ALSO THAT AROUSAL ISN'T UNITARY THAT THERE ARE BEHAVIOUR SPECIFIC FORMS OF AROUSAL AND I THINK THE JURY IUS STILL OUT AS TO WHETHER THERE IS SUCH A THING AS COMPLETELY GENERALIZE AROUSAL OR NOT I THINK SOME PEOPLE WOULD ARGUE THERE IS BUT I THINK MORE ATTENTION NEEDS TO BE PAID TO THIS QUESTION OF DOMAIN SPECIFIC OR BEHAVIOR SPECIFIC FORMS OF AROUSAL IT'S A SUPER INTERESTING IDEA CAS I WAYS THOUGHT OF AROUSAS ALONG A CONTINUANLY UNIN BEIN A PANIC ATTACK AT THE ONE END OF THE EXTREME ORCAN BE IN A COMA AND THAT SOMEWHERE IN THE MID YOUR ALERTIN CALM BUT THEN THIS ISSUE OVEILANCE REALLY AS YOU AS YOU SAY A PRESENTS THIS OPPORTUNITY THAT REALLY THERE MIGHT BE MULTIPLE CIRCUITS FOR AROUSAL OR MULTIPLE NECHANISMS THAT WOULD INCLUDE NOR CHEM CLES AS WELL AS DIFFERENT NORAL PATHWAYS SO LIKE TO TALK A BIT ABOUT A STATE A IF IF IT IS INDEED A STATE A WHICH IS AGGRESSION YOUR LAPS WORKED EXTENSIVELY ON THIS AND IF YOU WOULD COULD YOU HIGHLIGHT SOME OF IT THE KEY FINDINGS THERE A WHICH BRAIN AIRA IS ARE INVOLVED A THE BEAUTIFUL WORK OF DAU LIN AND OTHERS IN YOUR LAB AM THAT POINT TO THE IDEA THAT INDEED THERE ARE AND OF SWITCHES IN THE BRAIN BUT THAT THINKING OF SWITCHES FOR AGGRESSION MIGHT BE TOO SIMPLE A HOW SHALL WE THINK ABOUT AGGRESSION AND I'LL JUST YUSORT OF OBSCUE THE QUESSION A BIT MORE BY SAYING WE SEE LOTS OFDIFFERENT KINDS OF AGGRESSION A THIS TERRIBLE SHO SCHOOLSHOOTING DOWN IN TEXAS RECENTLY CLEARLY AN ACT THAT INCLUDED AGGRESSION AND YET UYOU COUL IMAGINE THAT'S A VERY DIFFERENT TYPE OF AGGRESSION THAN AT YOU KNOW IT IN ALL OUTRAGE OR CONTROL AGGRESSION WHEN INOTHER'S THERE'S A LOT OF VARIATION THERE SO A WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON AGGRESSION HOW ITS GENERATED THE NERAL CIRCUIT MECHANISMS AND SOME OF THE VARIATION IN WHAT WE CALL AGGRESSION YEL THIS IS A GREAT QUESTION AND ITS A ITS A LARGE AREA I WOULD SAY THAT THE FIRST OF ALL A THE WORD AGGRESSION IN MY MIND REFERS MORE TO A DESCRIPTION OF BEHAVIOR THAN IT DOES TO AN INTERNAL STATE A AGGRESSION COULD REFLECT AN INTERNAL STATE THAT WE WOULD CALL ANGER IN HUMANS OR COULD REFLECT FEAR OR IT COULD REFLECT HUNGER IF ITS PREDATORY AGGRESSION AND SO THIS GETS AT THE ISSUE THAT YOU RAISED OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF AGGRESSION THAT EXIST A THE WORK THAT DIU DED WHEN SHE WAS IN MY LAB A THAT REALLY BROKE OPEN THE FIELD TO THE APPLICATION OF MODERN GENETIC TOOLS FOR STUDYING CIRCUITS AND MICE IS THAT SHE FOUND AWAY TO EVOKE AGGRESSION IN MICE USING OP THE GENETICS TO ACTIVATE SPECIFIC NURONS IN REGION OF THE HYPOTHALYMIS THE VENTRIMEDIAL HYPOTHAMUS V M H WHICH PEOPLE HAD BEEN STUDYING AND AND LOOKING AT FOR DECATES FOLLOWING FIRST THE WORK OF A A IN IN HATS THE FAMOUS NO WELL PRIZE WINNING WORK AOF WALTER HES AND AND THEN FOLLOWED BY WORK DON BY MENOCROOK IN THE NETHERLANDS IN RATS WHERE THEY WOULD STICK ELECTRICAL WIRS INTO THE BRAIN AND SEND ELECTRIC CURRENTS INTO THE BRAIN AND THEY COULD TRIGGER A PLACID AT TO SUDDENLY SPARE ITS TEETH HISS AND ALMOST STRIKE OUT AT THE EXPERIMENTOR A AND THEY COULD TRIGGER A A RATS TO FIGHT WITH EACH OTHER AND EVEN IN HESSES ORIGINAL EXPERIMENTS HE DESCRIBES TWO TYPES OF AGGRESSION THAT HE EVOKES FROM CATS DEPENDING ON WEAR IN THE HYPOTHALYMIS HE PUTS HIS ELECTRODE ONE OF WHICH HE CALLS DEFENSIVE RAGE THAT'S THE EARS LAID BACK TEETH BARED AND HISSING AND THE OTHER ONE IS PREDATORY AGGRESSION WHERE THE THE CAT HAS ITS EARS FORWARD AND ITS LIKE BATTING WITH ITS PAW AT A MOUSE LIKE OBJECT LIKE IT WANTS TO CATCHET AND EATIT SO HE ALREADY HAD AT THAT STAGE SOME INFORMATION ABOUT SEGREGATION AN THE BRAIN OF DIFFERENT FORMS OF AGGRESSION SO FAST FORWARD TO A A TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TWO THOUSAND NINE A WHEN DAUE CAME TO THE LAB AND WE HAD STARTED WORKING ON AGGRESSION AND FRUITFULIES AND I WANTED TO BRING IT INTO MICE SO THAT WE COULD APPLY GENETIC TOOLS AND WE STARTED BY HAVING DIUE WHO WAS AN ELECTROPHYSIOLOGIST JUST REPEAT THE ELECTRICAL STIMULATION OF THE VENTRIMDIAL HYPOTHALYMIS IN THE MOUSE JUST LIKE PEOPLE ADON IN RATS IN CATS IN CAMPSTERS EVEN IN MONKEYS AND SHE COULD NOT GET THAT EXPERIMENT TO WORK OVER FORTY DIFFERENT TRIALS IT JUST DIDN'T WORK WHAT SHE GOT INSTEAD WAS FEAR BEHAVIOURS SHE GOT FREEZING CORNERING AND CROUCHING AND FINALLY IN DESPERATION AND WE GOT A LOT OF IN PUT FROM MENO CROOK ON THIS HE REALLY WAS MYSTIFIED WHY DOESN'T IT WORK IN MICE WE REALIZED WHY THERE HAD BEEN NO PAPER ON BRAIN STIMULATED AGGRESSION IN MICE IN FIFTY YEARS COS THE EXPERIMENT DOESN'T WORK AND  THE THE ONE BIT OF CREDIT I CAN CLAIM THERE AS I CONVINCED DAUE TO TRY OPTHE GENETICS BECAUSE I IT JUST HAD SORT OF OM IN TO USE DEEP IN THE BRAIN FROM CRAWLDICE ROTH IN OTHERS WORK A AND I THOUGHT MAY BE BECAUSE IT COULD BE DIRECTED MORE SPECIFICALLY TO A REGION OF THE BRAIN AND TYPES OF CELLS AND OP THE GENETIC STIMULATE THEN ELECTRICAL STIMULATION IT MIGHT WORK AND DIVUSAID NEVER NEVER GE A WORK IF IT DOESN'T WORK WITH ELECTRICITY WHY SHOULD IT WORK WITH AOP THE GENETICS AND THE FACT IS THAT IT DID WORK AND WE WERE ABLE TO AA TRIGGER AGGRESSION IN THIS REGION USING OP THE GENETIC STIMULATION OF VENTRIMEDEAL HYPOTHALYMIS AND IN RETROSPECT I THINK THE REASON THAT WE WERE SEEING ALL THESE FEAR BEHAVIOURS IS BECAUSE RIGHT AT THE UPPER PART IF YOU THINK OF VENTR OF VENTRIMEDIAL HYPOTHALYMIS LIKE A PHAIR SITTING ON THE GROUND THE FAT PART OF THE PAIR O NEAR THE GROUND IS WHERE THE AGGRESSION ERONS ARE BUT THE UPPER PART OF THE PAIR HAS FEAR NURONS AND IT COULD BE E AUSE IT SO SMALL IN A MOUSE WHEN YOU INJECT ELECTRICAL CURRENTS ANYWHERE IN THE PAIR IT FLOWS UP THROUGH THE ENTIRE PAIR AND IT ACTIVATES THE FIER CIRCUITS AND THOSE TOTALLY DOMINATE AGGRESSION AND SO THAT'S WHY WE WERE NEVER ABLE TO SEE ANY FIGHTING WITH ELECTRICAL STIMULATION WERS WHEN YOU USE OP THE GENETICS YOU CONFINE THE STIMULATION JUST TO THE REGION WHERE YOU IN PLANTED THAT CHANNEL REDOPSIN GEN INTO THOSE NURANTS O AND SO IN FAST FORD FROM THAT FROM A LOT OF WORK FROM DIUE NOW ON HER OWN AND WHY YOU AND WITH HER POSTOCK AND AGGRET FALKNER A THEREIS AS WELL AS WORK OF OTHER PEOPLE THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT THE TYPE OF FIGHTING THAT WE WERE THAT WE ELICIT WHEN WE STIMULATE V M H IS OFFENSIVE AGGRESSION THAT IS ACTUALLY REWARDING TO MALE MY SHEY LIKE IT THEY LIKE IT MALE MICE WILL PRESS LEARN TO POKE THEIR NOSE OR PRESS A BAR TO GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO BEAT UP A SUBORDINATE MALE MOUSE AND IN MORE RECENT EXPERIMENTS IF YOU ACTIVATE THOSE NURONS AND THE MOUSE HAS A CHANCE TO BE IN ONE OF TO COMPARTMENTS IN A BOX THEY WILL GRAVITATE TOWARDS THE COMPARTMENT WHERE THOSE NURONS ARE ACTIVATED IT HAS A POSITIVE VAILANCE AND WHEN I WENT INTO THIS FIELD WHEN I WAS THINKING WELL WHAT GOES ON IN MY BRAIN AND MY BODY WHEN I'M FURIOUS IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T FEEL LIKE A REWARDING EXPERIENCE ITS NOT SOMETHING THAT I WOULD WANT A REPEAT BECAUSE IT FEELS GOOD WHEN I'M IN THAT STATE IT DOESN'T FEEL GOOD AT ALL WHEN I'M IN THAT STATE AND IT IS STILL I THINK A MYSTERY AS TO WHERE THAT TYPE OF AGGRESSION WHICH IS MORE DEFENSEIVE AGGRESSION THET KIND OF AGGRESSION YOU FEEL IF YOU'RE BEING ATTACKED OR IF YOU BEEN CHEATED MY SOMEBODY WHERE THAT IS INCODED IN THE BRAIN AND HOW THAT WORKS STILL I THINK IS A A VERY IMPORTANT MYSTERY THAT WE HAVEN'T SOLVED AND PREDATORY AGGRESSION THERE HAS BEEN SOME PROGRESS ON SO MY SHOW PREDATORY AGGRESSION THEY USE THAT TO CATCH CRICKETS THAT THEY EAT AND THAT INVOLVES DIFFERENT CIRCUITS THAN THE VENTRIMEDEAL HYPOTHOLAMIC CIRCUITS SO IT'S BECOME CLEAR THAT IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT THE STATE OF AGGRESSIVE NESTS IS MULTIFACITED IT DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF AGGRESSION AND IT INVOLVES DIFFERENT SORTS OF CIRCUITS THERE IS THERE'S A PAPER SUGGESTING THAT THERE MIGHT BE A FINAL COMMEN PATHWAY FOR ALL AGGRESSION IN A REGION WHICH IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITES ITS CALLED THE SUBSTANTIA IN NOMINADA THE SUBSTANCE WITH NO NAME  I LIKE ANATERISAR SO ETIS WOR THE NUCLIOUS AMBIGUOUS YIU KNOW OR THE ZONA INSERT OF THESE ARE PLACES THAT NO ONE CAN THINK OF WHAT THEY ARE ANYHOW THAT MIGHT BE A FINAL COMMON PATHWAY FOR PREDATORY AGGRESSION AN OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE AGGRESSION BUT IT CAN BE REALLY HARD TO TELL JUST FROM LOOKING AT A MOUSE FIGHT WHETHER IT'S ENGAGED IN OFFENSIVE OR DEFENSIVE AGGRESSION WE'VE TRIED TO TAKE THAT A PART USING MACHINE LEARNING ANALYSIS OF BEHAVIOR BUT IN RATS FOR EXAMPLE IT'S MUCH CLEARER WHEN THE ANIMALS ENGAGED IN OFFENSIVE VERSES DEFENSIVE AGGRESSION THEY DIRECT DHEIR BIGHTS AT DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE OPPONENT'S BODY IN PUNACULARSS AOFFENSE IVE AGGRESSION IS FLANK DIRECTED DEFENSE IVE AGGRESSION GOES FOR THE NECK GOES FOR THE THROAT I'VE SEEN SOME NATURE SPECIALS WHERE IN A VERY AM BARBARIC WAY AT LEAST TO ME IT SEEMS A LIKE HYENAS WILL TRY AND GO AFTER THE THE REPRODUCTIVE A AXIS THEY'LL GO AFTER TESTACLES AND PENES AND THEY BUSY ANE O IT SEEMS THEY WANT A LIMIT A FUTURE BREEDING POTENTIAL BUTREA PAIN THAT OR CREA OR CREAPIN OR BOTH YA I MEAN IN TERMS OF A OFFENSIVE AGGRESSION AND AND THE YOURE A REFLECTION THAT IT DOESN'T FEEL GOOD  I MEAN I CAN SAY I KNOW SOME PEOPLE WHO REALLY ENJOY FIGHTING AM OFA RELATIVE WHOS A LAWYER HE LOVES TO ARGUE AND FIGHT IAM I DON'T THINK OF A MIN AS PHYSICALLY AGGRESSIVE FACT HE'S NOT BE LOVES TO FIGHT AND LOVES TO PROSECUTE AND GO AFTER PEOPLE ANTS AND HE'S PRETTY EFFECTIVE OUT IT OF A FRIEND FORMER A MILITARY SPECIAL OPERATIONS AND VERY CALM GUY HAD A GREAT CAREERING IN THE A IN MILITARY SPECIAL OPERATIONS AND HED HE'LL QUITE YOU'NL PLAINLY SAY I LOVE TO FIGHT IT'S ONE OF T ONE OF MY GREAT JOYS HE REALLY ENJOYED HIS WORK YE A AND AND ALSO RESPECT TO THE OTHER SIDE BECAUSE THEY OFFERD THE OPPORTUNITY TO TEST THAT THAT AND TO EXPERIENCE THAT JOY SO IN A KIND OF BAZAAR WAY TO SOMEBODY LIKE ME WHO I'LL CERTAINLY A DEFEND MY STANDE IF I NEED TO BUT I CERTAINLY M DON'T CONCERN MYSELF SOMEBODY WHO OFFENSIVELY GOES AFTER PEUL JUST TO GO AFTER THEM THERE'S NO A QUOTEN QUOTE DOPAMEAN HIT HERE 'RE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT DOBEMEN DOES MANY THINGS OF COURSE I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESSIONS ABOUT THE WAY YOU DESCRIBE THIS THE CIRCUITRY I SHOULD SAY THE WAY THE CIRCUITRY IS ARRANGED AND OF COURSE WE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE A WE WEREN'T CONSULTED THAT THE DESIGN FASE BUT WHY DO YOU THINK THERE WOULD BE SUCH A CLOSE POSITIONING OF NURONS THAT CAN ELICIT SUCH DIVERGIN STATES AND BEHAVIORS MERE TALKING ABOUT THIS PAIR SHAPED STRUCTURE WHERE THE NURONS THAT GENERATE FEAR ARE CHEEK TO JOWL WITH THENURONS THAT GENERATE OFFENSIVE AGGRESSION OF ALL THINGS IT'S LIKE A PUTTING THE NURONS THAT CONTROL A SWALLOWING NEXT TO THE NRONS THE CONTROL VOMITING IT SEEMS TO ME THAT A ON THE ONE HAND THIS IS THE WAY THAT NARL CIRCUITS ARE OFTEN ARRANGED AND YET TO ME IT'S ALWAYS BEEN PERPLEXING AS TO WHY THIS WOULD BE THE CASE YI THINK THAT THAT IS A VERY PRO FOUND QUESTION AND A I I'VE WONDERED ABOUT THAT ALLOT A IF YOU THINK FROM AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE A IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE CASE THAT DEFENSIVE BEHAVIOURS AND FEAR AROSE BEFORE OFFENSIVE AGGRESSION A BECAUSE ANIMALS FIRST INFOREMOST HAVE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES FROM PREDATION BY OTHER ANIMALS AND MAY BE ITS ONLY WHEN THER COMFORTABLE WITH HAVING WARDED OFF PREDATION AND MADE THEMSELVES SAFE THAT THEY CAN START ABOUT START TO THINK ABOUT WHOSE N TO BE THE ALPHIMAL IN IN MY GROUP HERE AND SO IT COULD BE THAT IF YOU THINK THAT BRAIN REGIONS AND SELL POPULATIONS EVOLVED BY DUPLICATION AND MODIFICATION OF PREEXISTIN SELL POPULATIONS THAT MIGHT BE THE WAY THAT THOSE REGIONS WOUND UP NEXT TO EACH OTHER A AND DEVELOPMENTALLY THEY START OUT FROM A COMMON POOL OF PRECURSORS THAT EXPRESSES THE SAME GENE THE FEAR NURONS AND THE AGGRESSION NURNS AND THEN WITH DEVELOPMENT IT GET SHUT OFF IN THE AGGRESSION NURONS AND MAINTAINED IN THE FEAR NURONS NOW THAT THAT VEW SAYS OETS JUST IN IT'S AN ACCIDENT OF EVOLUTION AND DEVELOPMENT BUT I THINK THERE MUST BE A FUNCTIONAL PART AS WELL SO ONE THING WE KNOW ABOUT OFFENSE OF AGGRESSION IS THAT STRONG FEAR SHUTS IT DOWN WHEREAS DEFENSIVE AGGRESSION AT LEAST IN RATS IS ACTUALLE ENHANCED BY FEAR IT'S ONE OF THE BIG DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DEFENSIVE AGGRESSION AND OFFENSIV AGGRESSION AND YOU THINK ABOUT IT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IF OFFENSE OF AGGRESSION IS REWARDING AND PLEASURABLE IF YOU START TO GET REALLY SCARED THAT TENDS TO TAKE THE FUN OUT OF IT AND MAY BE THESE TWO REGIONS ARE CLOSE TO EACH OTHER TO FACILITATE INHIBITION OF AGGRESSION BY FEET THE FEAR NURONS WE KNOW FOR A FACT THAT IF WE DELIBERATELY STIMULATE THOSE FEAR NURONS AT THE TOP OF THE HARE WHEN TWO ANIMALS ARE INVOLVED IN A FIGHT IT JUST STOPS THE FIGHT DEAD IN ITS TRACTS AND THEY GO OFF INTO THE CORNER AND FREEZE SO AT LEAST HIERARCHICALLY IT SEEMS LIKE FEAR IS THE DOMINANT BEHAVIOUR OVER OFFENSEIV AGGRESSION AND HOW THAT INHIBITION WOULD WORK IS NOT CLEAR CAUSE ALL THESE NURONS ARE PRETTY MUCH EXCITATORY THERE ALMOST ALL GLUDIMATURGION AND SO ONE OF THE INTERESTING QUESTIONS FOR THE FUTURE IS HOW EXACTLY DOES FEAR DOMINATE OVER AND SHUT DOWN OFFENSIVE AGGRESSION THE BRAIN HOW DOES THAT WORK IS AT ALL CIRCUITORY OF THEIR CHEMICALS INVOLVED WHAT'S THE MECHANISM AND WHEN IS IT CALLED INTO PLAY A BUT I THINK THATS THE WAY I TEND TO THINK ABOUT WHY THESE NURANS ARE ARE ALL MIXED UP TOGETHER AND IT'S NOT JUST FIGHT AND FREEZING OR FIGHT AND FLIGHT THERE ARE ALSO METABOLIC NURONS THAT ARE MIXED TOGETHER IN VI MH IS WELL CONTROLLING THE BODY WHIDE METABOLIS YA THEY ARE ZURANS THERE THAT RESPOND TO GLUCOES WHEN GLUCOES GOES UP IN IN YOUR BLOOD STREAM THEYRE ACTIVATED AND TE MH HAS A WHOLE HISTORY IN THE FIELD OF OBESITY BECAUSE IF YOU DESTROY IT IN A RAT YOU GET A FAT RAT SO THE WAY MOST OF THE WORLD THINKS ABOUT VE M H AS THEY THINK ABOUT OH THAT'S THE THING THAT KEEPS YOU FROM GETTING FAT AS THE ANTIOBESITY AREA BUT IN THE AREA OF SOCIAL BEHAVIOR  WE SEE IT AS A CENTRE FOR CONTROL OF AGGRESSION AND FOUR BEHAVIORS AND AGAIN WHY THESE THESE NURANS IN THESE FUNCTIONS I I LIKE TO CALL THEM THE FOR FS FEEDING FREEZING FIGHTING AND MATING THAT THEY ALL SEEM TO BE CLOSELY INTERMINGLED WITH EACH OTHER MAYBE BECAUSE CROSS TALK BETWEEN THEM IS VERY IMPORTANT TO HELP THE ANIMALS BRAIN DECIDE WHAT BEHAVIOR TO PRIARATIES AND WHAT BEHAVIOR TO SHUT DOWN AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WILL DO IS LINKED TO THE INCREDIBLE VIDIOS OF THESE MICE THAT HAVE A SELECTIVE STIMULATION OF NURONS IN THE VIAMH DIUSE AND THE OTHER STUDIES THAT YOU'VE DONE ONE OF WHENEVER I TEACH I SHOW THOSE VIDIOS AT SOME POINT A WITH THE CAVIATS AND WARNINGS THAT ARE REQUIRED WHEN ONE IS ABOUT TO SEE A VIDIO OF A MOUSE TRYING TO MATE WITH ANOTHER MOUSE WERE MATING WITH ANOTHER MOUSE AND THEY SEEM BOTH TO BE QUITE HAPPY ABOUT THE MATING EXPERIENCE ILYS AS FAR AS WE KNOW AS OBSERVERS OF MICE AND THEN UPON STIMULATION OF THOSE VE EMH NERONS ONE OF THE MICE SOSHE TRIES TO KILL THE OTHER MOUSE AND THEN WHEN THAT STIMULATION IS STOPPED THEY BASILY GO BACK TO HANGING OUT THEY DON'T GO RIGHT BACK TO MATN I SOME RECONCILIATION CLEARLY THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN FIR YES WE ASSUME BUT IT'S JUST SO STRIKING I THINK EQUALLY STRIKING AS THE VIDIO WHERE THE MOUSE IS ALONE IN THERE WITH THE GLOVE THE VEEMAHINARONS ARE STIMULATED AND THE MOUSE GOES INTO A RAGE AT LOKS HIK OIT WANCE TO KILL THE GLOVE YEBASICALLY A SO STRIKING I ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GO WATCH THOSE BECAUSE IT REALLY PUTS A UT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF COLOR ON WHAT WE'RE DESCRIBING AND IT'S JUST THE IDEA THAT THERE ARE SWITCHES IN THE BRAIN A TO ME REALLY BECAME CLEAR UPON SEEING THAT O ONE OF THE CONCEPTS SCUSE ME ONE OF THE CONCEPTS THAT A YOU'VE RAISED IN YOUR LECTURES BEFORE AND AND THAT I THINK WAS HES'S IDEA IS THIS IDEA OF A SORT OF HYDRAULIC PRESSURE MAYBE  AS CALL TAT CONLAD CONRADI CANT SPEAK DOW S GUSE ME CONRAD LORENS ERN WHO TALKED ABOUT A KIND OF HYDRAULIC PRESSURE TOWARDS BEHAVIOR I'MFASCINATED BY THIS IDEA OF HYDRAULIC PRESSURE A BECAUSE I DON'T CONSIDER MYSELF A HOT TEMPERED PERSON BUT I AM FAMILIAR WITH THE FACT THAT WHEN I LOSE MY TEMPER IT TAKES QUITE A WHILE FOR ME TO SIMMER DOW I CAN'T THINK ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE I DON'T WANT A THINK ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE IN FACT THINK TRYING TO THINK ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE BECOMES AVERSIVE TO ME WHICH TO ME UNDER SCORES THIS NOTION OF PRIORDIZATION OF THE DIFFERENG OF STATES AND PETENTIAL CONFLICTING STATES WHAT DO YOU THINK FUNNELS IN TO THIS IDEA OF HYDRAULIC PRESSURE TOWARD A STATE AND WHY IS IT PERHAPS THAT SOMETIMES WE CAN BE VERY ANGRY AND IF WE SUCCEED IN WINNING AN ARGUMENT ALL A SUDDEN IT WILL SUBSIDE AM BECAUSE CLEAR THAT MEANS THAT THERE ARE EXTERNAL INFLUENCES IT'S A COMPLEX SPACE HERE THAT WE'RE RE CREATING I REALIZE THEM CREATING A BIT OF A CLOWD AND I'M DOING IT ON PURPOSE BECAUSE TO ME THE IDEA OF A HYDRAULIC PRESSURE TOWARDS A STATE LIKE SLEEP THERE'S A SLEEP PRESSURE THERE'S THERE'S A PRESSURE TOWARD A RT THAT ALL MAKE SENSE BUT WHAT'S INVOLVED IS IT TO MULTIFACTORIAL TO TO ACTUALLY IM SEPARATE OUT THE VARIABLES BUT WHAT WHAT'S WHAT'S REALLY DRIVING HYDRAULIC PRESSURE TOWARD A GIVEN STATE YE SO A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION AH I THINK ONE WAY THAT IS HELPFUL AT LEAST FOR ME TO BREAK THIS QUESTION OF PART AND THINK ABOUT IT IS TO DISTINGUISH HOME YOSTATIC BEHAVIORS THAT IS NEED BASE BEHAVIORS WHERE THE PRESSURE IS BUILT UP BECAUSE OF A NEED LIKE I'M HUNGRY I NEED TO EED I'M THIRSTY I NEED TO DRINK I'M HOT I NEED TO GET TO A COLD PLACE ASPASICALY THE THERMASTAT MODEL OF YOUR BRAIN YOU HAVE A SET POINT AND THEN IF THE TEMPERATURE GETS TO HOT YOU TURN ON THE A C AND IF THE TEMPERATURE GETS TO COLD YOU TURN ON THE HETERN YOU PUT YOURSELF BACK TO THE SET POINT I DON'T THINK THAT'S HOW A GRESSION WORKS THAT IS IT'S NOT THAT WE ALL GO AROUND AT LEAST SUBJECTIVELY I DON'T GO ROUND WITH AN ACCUMULATING NEED TO FIGHT WHICH I THEN LOOK FOR SOMETHING TO AN EXCUSE TO RELEASE IT NOW MAYBE THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT DO THAT THEY GO OUT AND LOOK FOR BOUR FIGHTS TO GET INTO TOR QUITTER YE TWIT WITER SENO TO YOUR ATMS OR HALF JOKE AND GETS TWITTER SEEMS TO DRAW A REASONABLY SIZED CROWD OF PEOPLE THAT ARE THERE FOR COMBAT OF SOME SORT I EVEN THOUGH THE TOTAL INTELLECTUAL POWER OF ANY OF THEIR COMMENTS IS ABOUT THAT OF A CAP GUN THET SEEM O REALLY LIKE TO FIRE I OFF THAT CATRON BUT IT IN BUT I AGREE I'D LIKE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND ACKNOWLEDGE ONE OF OUR SPONSORS ATHLETIC GREENS ATHLETIC GREENS NOW CALLED AG ONE IS A VITEMENT MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK THAT COVERS ALL OF YOUR FOUNDATION AL NUTRITIONAL NEEDS I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND AN TWELVE SO A'M DELIGHTED THAT THEIR SPONSORING THE PODCAST THEREASON I STARRTY TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS IN THE REASON I STILL TAKE ATHLETIC GREENS ONCE ARE USUALLY TWICE A DAY IS THAT IT GETS O ME IN THE PROBIOTICS THAT I NEED FOR GOT HEALTH I GOT IS VERY IMPORTANT ITS POPULATED BY GOT MYCROBIODA THAT COMMUNICATE WITH THE BRAIN THE MMUN SYSTEM AND BASICALLY ALL THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS OF OUR BODY TO STRONGLY IMPACT OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG TURN HEALTH AND THOSE PROBATICS AND ATHLETIC GREENS ARE OPTIMAL AND VITAL FOR MICROBIOTIC HEALTH IN ADDITION IT LETIC GREENS CONTAINS A NUMBER OF ADAPTIGENS VITEMENTS AND MINERALS THAT MAKE SURE THAT ALL MY FOUNDATIONAL NUTRICIONAL NEEDS ARE MET AND IT TASTES CRIPE IF YOU LIKE TO TRY ATH LETIC GREENS YOU CAN GO TO AT LETI GREENS DOT CALM SLASH HUBERMEN AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS THAT MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO MIX UP ATHLETIC GREENS WHILE YOU'RE ON THE ROAD IN THE CAR ON THE PLAIN ET CETERA AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU A YEAR SUPPLY OF VITEMIND THREE K TOO AGAIN THAT'S THAT LETI GRENS DOT CAMS SLASH HUBERMEN TO GET THE FIVE FREE TRAVEL PACKS AND THE YEAR SUPPLY A VITEMIND THREE K TO YE SO YOU CAN THINK YOU CAN THINK OF THIS ACCUMULATED HI DRAWLIC PRESSURE EITHER BEING BASED ON SOMETHING THAT YOU WERE DEPRIVED OF CREATING AN ACCUMULATING NEED OR SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO DO BUILDING UP A A ADRI OR A PRESSURE TO DO THAT AND THE NATURAL WAY TO THINK ABOUT THAT AT LEAST FOR ME IS AS GRADUAL INCREASES IN NURL ACTIVITY IN A PARTICULAR REGION OF THE BRAIN AND SO FOR EXAMPLE IN THE AREA OF THE BRINT OF TH HYPOTHALMIS THAT CONTROLS FEEDING SCOT STERNSON AND OTHERS HAVE SHOWN THAT THE HUNGRIER YOU GET THE HIGHER THE LEVEL OF ACTIVITY IN THAT REGION IN THE BRAIN AND THEN WHEN YOU EAT BOOM THE ACTIVITY GOES RIHT BAK DOWN AGAIN AND A THAT STATE IS ACTUALLY NEGATIVELY VEILANC SO IT'S LIKE THE ANIMAL KON  FEELS INCREASINGLY UNCOMFORTABLE JUST LIKE WE FEEL INCREASINGLY UNCOMFORTABLE THE HUNGRIER WE ARE AND THEN WHEN WE EAT IT TAMPS IT DOWN BUT THERE IS THIS INCREASED ACTIVITY AND I THINK IN THE CASE OF A GRESSION OUR DATA ANOTHERS SHOW THAT THE MORE STRONGLY YOU DRIVE THIS REGION OF THE BRAIN OPTOGENETICALLY THE MORE OF JUST TA HAIR TRIGGER YOU NEED TO SET THE ANIMAL OFF TO GET A TO FIGHT AND THE INTERESTING THING IS THAT IF THERE IS NOTHING FOR THE ANIMAL TO ATTACK IT DOESN'T REALLY DO MUCH WHEN YOUR STIMULATING THIS REGION IT SORT OF WANDERS AROUND THE CAGE A LITTLE BIT MORE BUT IT WILL NOT ACTUALLY SHOW OVER ATTACK IF UNLESS YOU PUT SOMETHING IN FRONT OF IT AND THE SAME THING IS TRUE FOR THE AREAS WE'VE DESCRIBED THE CONTROL MADING BEHAVIOR IS WHAT LINDSEY IS WORKING ON YOU CAN STIMULATE THOSE AREAS TILL YOU BLUE IN THE FACE AND THE MOSE JUST SORT OF WANDERS AROUND BUT IF YOU PUT ANOTHER MOUSE IN WAM YOU WILL TRY TO MOUNT THAT MOUSE IF YOU PUT A COMQUOT IN THE CASE HE'LL TRY TO MOUNT THE COMQUOT AND SO ITS IT BECOMES A SORT OF ANY PORT IN THE STORM SO THERE IS THIS IDEA THAT THE DRIVE IS BUILDING UP PRESSURE THAT SOMEHOW NEEDS TO BE RELEASED WHERE THAT PRESSURE IS ACTUALLY BEING EXERTED IF YOU ACCEPT THAT IT'S INCREASED ACTIVITY IN SOME CIRCUIT OR CIRCUITS SOME PLACE WHAT IS IT PUSHING UP AGAINST THAT NEEDS SOMETHING ELSE TO SORT OF UNPLUGG IT IN THE IN THE LORENT'S HYDRAULIC MODEL THAT IS YOU DON'T SEE THE BEHAVIOR UNTIL YOU RELEASE EVALVE ON THIS BUCKET AND LET THE ACCUMULATED PRESSURE FLOW OUT AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WERE TRYING TO STUDY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE MADING BEHAVIOR IS WELVE HOW DOES THE INFORMATION THAT THERE'S AN OBJECT IN FRONT OF YOU COME TOGETHER WITH THIS DRIVE STATE THAT IS GENERATED BY STIMULATING THESE NURONS ON THE HYPOTHALEMUS TO SAY O K PULL THE TRIGGER AND GO IT'S TIME TO MATE IT'S TIME TO ATTACK AND WERE JUST STARTING TO GET SOME INSIGHTS ITO THAT NOW FASCINATING I SHOUL MENTION PEOPLE A A DOCTOR ANIRSON MENTION LINDSEY LINDSEY HAS A FORMER GRADUATES TUNE OF MIND THAT'S NOW A POSTOCC IN DAVID'S LAB AND A I HAVEN'T CAUGHT UP WITH HER RECENTLY TO HEAR ABOUT THESE EXPERIMENTS WITH TAY SOUND FASCINATING I I'M WOULD LOVE TO SPEND SOME TIME ON THIS ISSUE OF WHY IS IT THAT A A MOUSE WON'T ATTACK NOTHING BUT IT'LL ATTACK EVEN A GLOVE A OR IN WHY A WEL ONLY TRYING MATE IF THERE'S ANOTHER A MOUSE TO MATE WITH SASHE A I THINK FORTUNATELY A FOR YOU YOU'RENOT SPENDING A LOT OF TIME ON TWITTER AN INSTURAMBUT OR YOUTU A BUT THERE'S THIS WHOLE ONLINE COMMUNITY THAT EXHISTS NOW AS FAR AS I KNOW IT'S A ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY YOUNG MALESE WHO ARE OBSESS WITH THIS IDEA A ALL TO SAY IT HAS A NAME IT'S CALLED NO FAP OF NO MASTERBATION AS A WAY TO MAINTAIN THEIR MOTIVATION TO GO OUT AND ACTUALLY SEEK MATES BECAUSE OF THE A READY AVAILABILITY OF ONLINE PORNOGRAPHY THERE'S ANY PROBABLY A MUCH LARGER POPULATION OF YOUNG MALES THAT ARE NEVER ASHALLY GOING OUT AND SEEKING MATES BECAUSE THER GETTING PORNEDICTED ET CETERA THES AS YE SERIOUS ISSUE THAT CAME UP IN OUR EPISODE WITH ON OLEMPKY WHO WROTE THE BOOKDOPEMI NATION O A BECAUSE THEY VAILABLE BUIL THE APORNOGRAPHY THERE'S A WHOLE SOCIAL CONTEXT THAT'S THAT'S BEEN CREATED ROUN THIS IN GENUINE ANDICTION A SO HUMANS A ARE NOT LIKE THE MICE R MICE OR NOT LIKE THE HUMANS A HUMANS I'M SEEM TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE ON THEIR OWN YON WAYS THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY IMPEDE AM SEEKING IN FINDING OF SEXTRAL PARTNERS ANY WERE LONG TERM MATES SO SERIOUS ISSUE THERE A I RAISE IT AS A SERIOUS ISSUE F THAT THAT I HEAR A LOT ABOUT S I CULD ASKED HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS IS THERE ANY PHYSIOLOGICAL BASIS FOR WHAT THEY CALL NO FAP AND I NEVER ACTUALLY REPLY CAUSE HERE'S NA DATA BUT A BUT WHAT YOUR RAISING HAIR IS A VERY INTERESTING A MECHANISTIC A SCYNARIO THAT A THAT CAN BECANNON AS YOU MENTION IS BEING EXPLORED SO WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE INTERNAL STATE OF A MOUSE WHOSE VEHEMATE IS BEING STIMULATED OR A MOUSE WHOSE A BREAK OTHER BRAIN REGION THAT CAN STIMULATE THE DESIRE TO MATE WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE INTERNAL STATE OF THAT A MOUSE IF IT'S JUST ALONE IN THE CAGE WANDERING AROUND AS IT WANDERING ROUND REALLY WANTING DIMATE AND REALLY WANTING TO FIGHT WE OF COURSE DON'T KNOW A BUT IS ITS HEART RATE UP IS ITS BLOOD PRESSURE UP AN IS IT WISHING THAT THERE WAS PONOGRAPHY AIS IT A A SOME THINGS GOING ON PRESUMABLY THAT'S DIFFERENT A THEN PRIOR TO THAT STIMULATION AND IS IT AROUSAL A AND WHAT YOU THINK IT IS ABOUT THE VISUALARAL FACTORY PERCEPTION OF THE CONSPECIFIC THAT UNGATES THIS TREMENDOUS REPERTOOUR BEHAVIORS RIGHT THAT THAT THAT IS THE CENTRAL QUESSION I CAN SAY AT LEAST WITH RESPECT TO THE FUR NURONS THAT SIT ON TOP OF THE AGGRESSION NURONS WE KNOW THAT WHEN THOSE NRONS ARE ACTIVATED UP THE GENETICALLY IN THE SAME WAY WE WOULD ACTIVATE THE AGGRESSION NURONS THAT THEIRE'S CLEARLY AN AROUSAL PROCESS THATS OCCURRING YOU CAN SEE THE PUPILS DILATE IN THE ANIMAL THERE IS AN INCREASE IN STRESS HORMONE RELEASE INTO THE BLOOD STREAM WE'VE SHOWN THAT A HEART RATE GOES UP SO IN ADDITION TO THE DRIVE TO ACTUALLY FREEZE WHICH IS WHAT THOSE ANIMALS DO THERE IS AUTONOMIC AROUSAL AND NEURO ANDICRINE ACTIVATION OF STRESS RESPONSES AND SOME OF THAT IS PROBABLY SHARED BY THE AGGRESSION NURONS AND THE MADYNURONTS ALTHOUGH WE HAVENAT INVESTIGATED IT IN AS MUCH DETAIL BUT I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISE BECAUSE THEY PROJECT TO MANY OF THE SAME REGIONS THAT THE A FURNERONTS PROJECT TO WHICH IS A INTERESTING ISSUE IN THE CONTECTS TO DISCUSS LATER MAY BE IN THE CONTEXT OF WHY WERE COMFORTABLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES THAT ARE BASED ON MALADAPTATIONS OF FEAR BUT NOT MENTAL ILLNESSES THAT ARE BASED ON MALADDAPTATIONS OF A GRESSION IF THEY HAVE PRETTY SIMILAR CIRCUITS IN THE BRAIN BUT A THAT'S THAT'S HOW I WOULD IMAGINE THERE IS AN AROUSAL DIMENSION AS YOU SAY THEIR STRESS HORMONS THAT ARE ACTIVATED THESE REGIONS VEEMATE PROJECTS TO ABOUT THIRTY DIFFERENT REGIONS IN THE BRAIN AND IT GETS INPOT FROM ABOUT THIRTY DIFFERENT REGIONS SO I KIND OF SEE IT AS BOTH AN ANTENA AND A BROADCASTING CENTR IS LIKE A SATELLITE DISH THAT TAKES IN INFORMATION FROM DIFFERENT SENSORY MODALITIES SMELL MAY BE VISION MECHANICAL A MECHANO SENSATION AND THEN IT SORT OF SYNTHESIZES AND INTEGRATES THAT INTO A FAIRLY LOW DIMENSIONAL AS THE COMPUTATIONAL PEOPLE CALL IT A REPRESENTATION OF THIS PRESSURE TO ATTACK AND AT BROADCAST THAT ALL OVER THE BRAIN TO TRIGGER ALL THESE SYSTEMS THAT HAVE TO BE BROUGHT INTO PLAY IF THE ANIMAL IS CAN ENGAGE IN AGGRESSION BECAUSE AGGRESSION IS A VERY RISKY THING FOR AN ANIMAL TO ENGAGI IT IT COULD WIND UP LOSING AND IT COULD WIND UP GETTING KILLED AND AND S O IT'S BRAIN CONSTANTLY HAS TO MAKE A COSS BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF WHETHER IT CONTINUE ON THAT PATH OR TO BACK OFF AS WELL AND I THINK THAT PART OF THIS BROADCASTING FUNCTION OF THIS REGION IS ENGAGING ALL THESE OTHER BRAIN DOMAINS THAT PLAY A ROLE IN THIS IND OF COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS ONE TALK MORE ABOUT MADING BEHAVIOR BUT AS A SEGWAY TO THAT AS WERE TALKING ABUT AGGRESSION AND MADING BEHAVIOR I THINK HORMONES AND WHENEVER THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY ON THIS PODCAST TO SHATTER A COMMON MYTH I I GRAB IT ONE OF THE COMMON MYTHS THAT'S OUT THERE I THINK THAT PERSISTS IS THAT TESTOSTERONE MAKES ANIMALS AND HUMAN'S AGGRESSIVE AND ESTROGEN MAKES ANIMALS PLACID AND KIND WERE EMOTIONAL AND AS WE BOTH KNOW NOTHING COD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH ALTHOUGH THERES SUMPTRUE TO THE IDEA THT THESE HORMONES ARE ALL INVOLVED A ROBERTSUPOLSKY A SUPPLIED SOME INFORMATION TO ME WHEN BECAME ON THIS PODCAST THAT  IF YOU GIVE PEOPLE EXOGENOUS TESTOSTRONE IT TENDS TO MAKE THE MORE OF THE WAY THEY WERE A BEFORE IF THEY WERE JERK BEFORE THAY BECOME MORE OF A JERK IF THEY WERE VERY ALTURISTIC THET BECOME MORE ALTURISTIC AND THEN EVENTUALLY I POINTED OUT YOU'LL ROMATIZE THAT TESTOSTRONE AND ESTROGEN IN YOUL ST ARE GETTING OPPOSITE VECT SO IT'S A IT'S A MERKY SPACE IT'S NOT STRAIGHTFORWARD BUT IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN TESTOSTRONE PLAYS A ROLL IN GENERATING AGGRESSION HOWEVER THE SPECIFIC HORMONS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN GENERATING AGGRESSION VIA V M H ARE THINGS OTHER THAN TESTOSTRONKS YOU TELLS O LA BIT MORE ABOUT THAT CAERS SOME INTERESTING SURPRISES IN THER YE THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION SO THE WHEN WE FINALLY IDENTIFIED THE NURON'S INV M H THAT CONTROL AGGRESSION WITH A MOLECULAR MARKER WE FOUND OUT THAT THAT MARKER WAS THE ESTROGEN RECEPTOR SO THAT MIGHT STRIKE YOU AS A LITTLE STRANGE WHY SHOULD A GRESSION PROMOTING NURONS IN MALE MICE BE LABELLED WITH THE ESTROGEN RECEPTOR A OTHER LABS HAVE SHOWN THAT THE ESTROGEN RECEPTOR IN ADULT MALE MICE IS NECESSARY FOR GRESSION IF YOU KNOCK OUT THE GENE IN V M H THEY DON'T FIGHT AND IT'S BEEN SHOWN AND A LOT OF IS'S WORK FROM YOUR COLLEAGUE NEAR OU SHAW AT STANFORD WHO IS ONE OF MY FORMER PH D STUDENTS THAT IF YOU CASTRATE A MOUSE AH AND IT LOSES THE ABIDDLE ABILITY TO FIGHT NOT ONLY CAN YOU RESCUE FIGHTING WITH A TESTOSTRONE IN PLANT BUT YOU CAN RESCUE IT WITH AN ESTROGEN IMPLANT SO YOU CAN BY PASS COMPLETELY THE REQUIREMENT FOR TESTOSTERON TO RESTORE AGGRESSIVENESS TO THE MICE AND AS YOU SAY IT'S BECAUSE MANY OF THE EFFECTS OF TESTOSTERONE ALTHOUGH NOT ALL MANY OF THEM ARE MEDIATED BY ITS CONVERSION TO ESTROGEN BY A PROCES CALLED A ROMATIZATION IT CARRIED OUT BY AN ENSIME CALLED AROMATAS IN FACT PEOPLE MAY AV MOST OF YOUR LISTENERS MAY HAVE HEARD OF AROMATASTECAUS AROMATAES IN HIBITERS ARE WIDELY USED IN FEMALE HUMANS AS ADUVENT KHEMOTHERAPE FOR BRESS CANCER THEY ARE AWAY OF REDUCING THE PRODUCTION OF ESTROGEN BY PREVENTING TESTOSTERONE FROM BEING CONVERTED INTO ESTROGEN AND A FACT THERE A LOT OF ANIMAL EXPERIMENTS SHOWING IF YOU GIVE MALES AROMATES AN HIBITERS THEY STOP FIGHTING AS WELL AS ALSO A STOP BEING SEXUALLY ACTIVE A AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE COUNTERUNTUITIVE IDEAS AND NERAL HAS SHOWN THE PROGESTERONE ALSO SEEMS TO PLAY A ROLE IN AGGRESSION BECAUSE THESE AGGRESSION DRONS ALSO EXEXPRESS THE PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR SO HERE ARE TWO HORMONES THAT HER CLASSICALLY THOUGHT OF AS FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE FORMOTHIS IS WHAT GOES UP AND GOES DOWN DURING THE ESTRA CYCLE ESTROGEN AND PROGESTERONE AND YET THEIR PLAYING  VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN CONTROLLING AGGRESSION IN MALE MICE AND PRESUMABLY IN MALE HUMANS AS WELL FASCINATING SO ESTERDN IS DOING MANY MORE THINGS THAN I THINK MOST PEOPLE BELIEVE AN TESTOSTRONE IS DOING MAYBE DIFFERENT AND FEWER THINGS IN SOME CASES IN MORE AN OTHERS I'VE KNOWN SOME AGGRESSIVE FEMALES SIME I'VE BEEN ALIVE WHAT'S INVOLVED IN FEMALE AGGRESSION THATS UNIQUE FROM THE PATHWAYS THAT GENERATE MALE AGGRESSION GREAT GREAT QUESTION SO A WE AND OTHER LABS HAVE STUDIED THIS IN BOTH MICE AND ALSO IN FRUITFULIES SO A ONE THING IN MICE THAT IS DISTINGUISHES AGGRESSION AN FEMALS FROM MALES IS THAT MALE MICE ARE PRETTY MUCH READY TO FIGHT AT THE DROP OF A HAT FEMALE MICE ONLY FIGHT WHEN THEY ARE NURTURING AND NURSING THEIR PUPS AFTER THEY'VE DELIVERED A LITTER AND THERE IS A WINDOW THERE WHERE THEY BECOME HIPER AGGRESSIVE AND THEN AFTER THEIR PUPS AR WEAND THAT AGGRESSIVENESS GOES AWAY SO THIS IS PRETTY REMARKABLE THAT YOU TAKE A VERGIN FEMALE MOUSE AND EXPOSE IT TO A MALE AND HER RESPONSE IS TO BECOME SEXUALLY RECEPTIVE AT TO MATE WITH HIM AND NOW YOU LETTER HAVE HER PUPS AND YOU PUT THE SAME MALE OR ANOTHER MALE MOUSE IN THE CAGE WITH HER AND INSTEAD OF TRYING TO MATE WITH HIM SHE ATTACKS HIM SO THERE IS SOME PRESUMABLY HORMONAL AND ALSO NERONAL SWITCH THAT'S OCCURRING IN THE BRAIN THAT SWITCHIS THE RESPONSE OF TE FEMALE FROM SEXS TO AGGRESSION A WHEN SHE GOES FROM VIRGINITY TO MATERNITY AND WE RECENTLY SHOWED IN A PAPER THIS IS WORK FROM ONE OF MY STUDENTS AMONG YOU LEW THAT WITH INVEHEMATION FEMALES THERE ARE TWO CLEARLY DIVISIBLE SUBSETS OF ESTROGEN RECEPTOR NURANS AND SHE SHOWED THAT ONE OF THOSE SUBSETS CONTROLS FIGHTING AND THE OTHER ONE CONTROLS MATING AND EFFACT IF YOU STIMULATE THE FIGHTING SPECIFIC SUB SUBSET IN A VERGIN YOU CAN GET THE VRGIN TO ATTACK WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE WERE NEVER NEVER ABLE TO DO BEFORE AH AND IF YOU STIMULATE THE MATING ONE YOU ENANSED MATING THE REASON WE COULD NEVER GET THESE RESULTS WHEN WE STIMULATED THE WHOLE POPULATION OF ESTROGEN RECEPTINURANS IS THAT THESE EFFECTS ARE OPPOCIT AND THE ANCEL OUT AND SO IT TURNS OUT THAT IF YOU MEASURE THE ACTIVITY OF THE FIGHTING AND THE MATING NURANS GOING FROM A VERGIN TO A MATERNAL FEMALE THE AGRESSION NURANS ARE VERY LOW IN THEIR ACTIVITY IN THE VERGIN BUT ONCE THE FEMALE HAS PUPS THE ACTIVATION ABILITY OF THOSE NURANDS GOES WAY UP AND THE MATING NURAN STAY THE SAME SO IF YOU THINK OF THE BALANCE BETWEEN THEM LIKE A SEA SAW IN THE VERGIN THERE IS MORE ACTIVITY IN THE MATING NURANS THAN IN THE FIGHTING NURANS WHEREAS IN H IN THE NURSING MOTHER THERE'S MORE ACTIVITY MORE ACTIVATION IN THE IN THE OTHER WAY AROUND THE FIGHTING NURANS IN THE MANE DID I SAY FIGHTING AND MING THE FIRST MATING NURADS DOMINATE FIGHTING IN THE VERGIN FIGHTING NURANS DOMINATE MATING IN IN THE MOTHER SO THAT'S A REALLY COOL A A OBSERVATION AND ITS NOT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS IN MALES AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT CAUSES THAT OR CONTROLS THAT A INTERESTINGLY THE THE THIS GETS INTO THE WHOLE ISSUE OF NURONS THAT ARE PRESENT IN FEMALES BUT NOT IN MALES SO WE'VE KNOWN FOR THE FIELD IS KNOW FOR LONG TIME THAT MALE AND FEMAL FRUIT FLIES HAVE SECSPECIFIC NURANS AND MOST OF THE NURANS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED IN FRUIT FLIES THAT CONTROL FIGHTING IN MALES ARE MALE SPECIFIC THEYARE NOT FOUND IN THE FEMALE BRAIN BUT RECENTLY WE DISCOVERED ASET OF FEMALE SPECIFIC FIGHTING NURANS IN THE FEMALE BRAIN A TOGETHER WITH A A COUPLE OF OTHER LABORATORIES NOW THEY DO SHARE ONE COMMON POPULATION OF NURANS IN BOTH MALE AND FEMALE FLIES THAT IN FEMALES ACTIVATES THE FEMALE SPECIFIC FIGHTING NURANS AND IN MALES ACTIVATES THE MALE SPECIFIC FIGHTING NURANS  AS KIND OF A HIERARCHY WITH THIS COMMON NURO ON TOP AND IN MICE WE DISCOVERED THAT THERE ARE MALE SPECIFIC NURANS IN VIHEMACH AND THOSE NURANS ARE ACTIVATED DURING MALE AGGRESSION NOW THET NURONS THAT ARE ACTIVE IN FEMALES WHEN FEMALES FIGHT IN VIEMACH ARE NOT SEC SPECIFIC SO THEY ARE ALSO FOUND IN MALES SO THIS IS ALREADY SHOWING YOU SOME COMPLEXITY THE MALE MA OUSVIMACH HAS BOTH MALE SPECIFIC AGGRESSION NURONS AND GENERIC AGGRESSION NURANTS AND THEN THE FEMALE VM H THE MADING CELLS ARE ONLY FOUND IN FEMALES THEY ARE FEMALE SPECIFIC AND NOT FOUND IN THE MALE BRAIN AND SO WERE TRING TO FIND OUT WHAT THESE SEX SPECIFIC POPULATIONS OF NURONS ARE DOING BUT THAT INDICATES THAT THAT IS SOME OF THE MECHANISM BY WHICH DIFFERENT SECES SHOW DIFFERENT BEHAVIOURS I'M FIXATED ON THIS A TRANSITION FROM THE VIRGIN FEMALE MALES TO THE MATERNAL FEMALE MALES I HAVE A COUPL OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT FOR INSTANCE THE TRANSITION IS GOVERNED BY THE PRESENCE OF POP SOFERANCE IF YOU TAKE A VIRGIN FEMALES SHE'LL MATE WITH A MALE A ONE SHE'S HAD PPS SHALL TRY AND FIGHT THAT MALE OR PRESUMBLY ANOTHER INTRUDER FEMALE I EQUALLY TOWARDS FEMALES AND MALE INTRUDERS DOES THAT REQUIRE THE PRESENCE OF HER POPS MEANING IF YOU  TO TAKE THOSE POPS AND GIVE THEM TO ANOTHER MOTHER IT DOES SHE REVERT TO THE MORE VIRGIN LIKE BEHAVIOR IS IT RELATED TO IS IT TRIGGER BY LACTATION OR COULD IT ACHALLY BE TRIGGERED BY THE MATING BEHAVIOUR ITSELF CAUSE ITS POSSIBLE FOR THE VIRGIN TO BECOME A NON VIRGIN BUT NOT ACTUALLY HAVE A LITTER OF POPS RIGHT THOSE ARE ALL GREAT QUESTIONS AND WE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER MOST OF THEM WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT A A NURSING MOTHER DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE HER POPS WITH HER IN THE CAGE IN ORDER TO ATTACK AN INTRUDER MALE OR AN INTRUDER FEMALE A A SHE IS JUST IN A STATE OF BRAIN THAT MAKES HER AGGRESSIVE TO ANY INTRUDER AND THOSE AGGRESSION NURONS IN THAT FEMALE'S BRAIN ARE ACTIVATED BY BOTH MALE AND FEMALE INTRUDERS EQUALLY WHEREAS IN MALE MICE THE AGGRESSION NRONS ARE ONLY EVER ACTIVATED BY MALES NOT BY FEMALES BECAUSE MALES ARE NEVER SUPPOSED TO ATTACK FEMALES THEIR ONLY SUPPOSED TO MATE WITH THEM SO THAT'S ANOTHER DIFFERENCE IN HOW THOSE NURONS ARE TUMED TO SIGNALS FROM DIFFERENT CONSPECIFICS DOES IT REQUIRE LACTATION I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT I THINK THERE ARE SOME EXPERIMENTS WERE PEOPLE HAVE TRIED TO CLASSICAL EXPERIMENTS PEOPLE HAVE TRIED TO REPRODUCE THE CHANGES AND HORMONS THAT OCCURD DURING PREGNANCY IN FEMALE RATS TO SEE IF IT CAN MAKE THEM AGGRESSIVE AND SOME OF THOSE MANIPULATIONS DO TO SOME EXTENT BUT THERE'S A WHOLE BIOLOGY THERE THAT REMAINS TO BE EXPLORED ABOUT HOW MUCH OF THIS IS HORMONED HOW MUCH OF THIS IS CIRCUITRY AND ELECTRICITY AND HOW MUCH OF IT IS OTHER FACTORS THAT WE HAVE AN IDENTIFIED YET I DON ANT A ANTHER PROMORIFIES BUT A WELL JUST ASKED THE QUESTION SAID THE OTHER DALE IS WATCHING A FERRETS MATE I  MUSTELIDS ER THEIR MUST LIDS AND HA THEIR MADING BEHAVIOR I GUESS I DIDN'T SAY WHI WAS WATCHING THIS DOESN'T MATTER A AI IT SIMPLY DOESN'T MATTER BUT IF ONE OBSERVES THE MATING BEHAVIORS OF DIFFERENT ANIMALS WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A TREMENDOUS RANGE OF MANY BEHAVIORS IN HUMANS AM THERE CAN BE NO AGGRESSIVE COMPONENT THAT COUN BE AGGRESSIVE COMPONENT HUMANS HAVE ALL SORTS OF KINGSAN FETTISHES AND BEHAVIORS AND MOST OF WHICH PROBABLY HAS NEVER BEEN DOCUMENT BECAUSE MOST OF THIS HAPPENS IN PRIVATE  HERE I ALWAYS SAY ON THIS POCK HAS ANY TIME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SECUAL BEHAVIOR IN HUMANS WERE ALWAYS MAKING THE PRESUMPTION THAT IT'S A CONSENTUAL AGE APPROPRIATE CONTECTS APPROPRIATE IN SPECIES APPROPRIATE LETS THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT A LOD DIFFERENT SPECIES WITH THAT SAID JUST TO SET CONTEXT AS WATCHING THIS VIDIO OF FERRETS MTING AND IT'S QUITE VIOLENT ACTUALLY THERE'S A LOT OF NECKBITING THERE'S A LOT OF SQUEALING IF I WERE GOING TO PROJECTAN AND APPROMORIFIES I'D SAY IT'S NOT REALLY CLEAR THEY BOTH WANT TO BE THERE IT YOU WOULD JUST ONE WOULD MAKE THAT ASSUMPTION AND COURSE WE DON'T KNOW WE HAVE NO IDEA THIS COULD BE THE RITUAL AM IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE IS SOME CROSS OVER OF AGGRESSION AND MATING BEHAVIOR CIRCUITRY JURING THE ACT OF THE MATING AND DO YOU THINK THAT REFLECTS THIS SORT OF AM A STEW OF COMPETING NURONS THAT ARE PRIORITIZING IN REAL TIME BECAUSE OF COURSE AS STATES THEY HAVE PERSISTENCE AS YOU POINT OUT INYOU CAN IMAGIN THAT STATES OVERLAPPING AFORE DIFFERENT STATES THAT THE MODIVATIONAL DRIVE TO MADE THE MOTIVATIONAL DRIVE TO GET AWAY FROM THIS EXPERIENCE THE MOTIVATIONAL DRIVE TO AM TO EAT AT SOME POINT A TO DEFICATE AT SOME POINT ALL O THE THNGS ARE COMPETING AND WHAT WERE REALLY SEEING IS A BIASIMPROBABILITIES BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT MATING BEHAVIOR OF VARIOUS ANIMALS YOU SEE AND AGGRESSIVE COMPONENT SOMETIMES BUT NOT ALWAYS IS IT SPECIES SPECIFIC IS AT CONTEXT SPECIFIC AND MORE GENERALLY DO YOU THINK THAT THERE A IS CROSSTALK BETWEEN THESE DIFFERENT URRONAL POPULATIONS AND THE ANIMAL ITSELF MIGHT BE KIND OF CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT GREAT GREAT QUESTIONS I CAN'T REALLY SPEAK TO THE ISSUE OF WHETHER THIS IS SPECIES SPECIFIC AUS I'M NOT A NATURALISTOR ZOOLOGIST I'VE SEEN LIKE YOU HAVE IN THE WILE FOR EXAMPLE LIONS WHEN THEY MATE I'VE SEEN THEM IN AFRICA THERS OFTEN ABITING COMPONENT OF THAT AS WELL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SURPRISED US WHEN WE IDENTIFIED NURONS IN VIMH VIELE THE CONTROL AGGRESSION IN MALES IS THAT WITH IN THAT POPULATION THERE IS A SUBSET OF NURONS THAT IS ACTIVATED BY FEMALES DURING MALE FEMALE MATING ENCOUNTERS NOW YOU DON'T GENERALLY THINK OF MOUSE SEXS AS ROUGH SEX BUT THERE THERE IS A LOT OF WHAT SUPERFICIALLY LOOKS LIKE VIOLENT BEHAVIOR SOMETIMES ESPECIALLY IF THE FEMALE REJECTS THE MALE AND RUNS AWAY AND THERE'S SOME EVIDENCE THAT THOSE FEMALE SELECTIVE NURONS IN VIEMACH ARE PART OF THE MATING A BEHAVIOR IF YOU SHUT M DOWN THE ANIMALS DON'T MATE AS EFFECTIVELY AS THEY OTHERWISE WOULD A WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU STIMULATE THEM WE DON'T YET KNOW BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A WAY TO SPECIFICALLY DO THAT WITHOUT ACTIVATING THE MALE AGGRESSION NURANS BUT I I THINK THEY MUST BE THERE FOR REASON BECAUSE THE EMACHEIS NOT TRADITIONALLY THE BRAIN REGION TO WHICH MALE SEXUAL BEHAVIOR HAS BEEN A SIGNE THAT'S ANOTHER AREA CALL THE MEDIAL PREOPTIC AREA AND THERE WE HAVE SHOWN THAT THERE ARE NURANTS THAT DEFINITELY STIMULATE MADING BEHAVIOR IN FACT IF WE ACTIVATE THOSE MADING NURANTS IN A MALE WHILE ITS IN THE MIDDLE OF ATTACKING ANOTHER MALE IT WILL STOP FIGHTING START SINGING TO THAT MALE AND START TO TRY TO MOUNT THAT MALE UNTIL WE SHUT THOSE NURANTS OFF SO THOSE ARE THE MAKE LOVE NOT WAR NURANTS AND VE EMATE ARE THE MATE WAR NOT LOVE NURNTS AND THERE ARE DENSE INTERCONNECTIONS BETWEEN THESE TWO NUCLII WHICH ARE VERY CLOSE TO EACH OTHER INTO THE IN THE BRAIN AND WE SHOWN THAT SOME OF THOSE CONNECTIONS ARE MUTUALLY INHIBITORY TO PREVENT THE ANIMAL FROM ATTACKING  EMATE THAT IT SUPPOSED TO BE MADING WITH OR TO PREVENT IT FROM MADING WITH SOME A ENANIMALAT SUPPOSED TO BE ATTACKING BUT IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THERE ARE SOME COOPERATIVE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THOSE STRUCTURES AS WELL AS A ANTAGONISTIC INTERACTIONS AND THE BALANCE OF WHETHER IT'S THE COOPERATIVE OR ANTAGONISTIC INTERACTIONS THAT ARE FIRING AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT IN A MADING ENCOUNTER AS YOU SUGGEST MAY DETERMINE WHETHER AT A MOMENT OF OF A OF A CUOITAL BLISS AMONG TO LIONS MAY SUDDENLY TERN INTO A SNAP OR A GROWL AND A BEARING OF FANGS WE DON'T KNOW THAT BUT CERTAINLY THE SUBSTRATE THE WIRING IS THERE FOR THAT TO HAPPEN I'MSURE PEOPLE'S I E MINDS AE RUNNING WILD WITH ALL THIS I'LL JUST USES AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESA SOMETHING I'VE WONDERED ABOUT FOR FAR TOO LONG WHICH IS A IAVE AFRENUSAE PSYCHIATRIST TO WORKS ON THE TREATMENT OF FETISHES IS IS NOT A PSYCHITRIS THAT I WAS TREATED BY ALTIS POINT THAT OUT BUT A THEY MENTION SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING TO ME LONG AGO WHICH IS THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT TRUE FETISHES AND WHAT MEANS THE CHRYTERIA FOR FETISH THAT THERE DOES SEEM TO BE SOME AWHAT ONE WOULD THINK WHAT BE COMPETING CIRCUITRY THAT SUDDENLY BECOMES A A LINE FOR INSTANCE A AVOIDANE OF A THESES DEAD BODIES FEET THINGS ARE VERY INFECTIES TYPICALLY THOSE STATES AND OF DISGUST AR ANTAGONISTIC TO STATES OF DESIRE AS ONE WOULD HOPE IS THAT PRESENT A DURING SEXUAL BEHAVIOR FETISHES OFTEN IN VOLVE EXACTLY THOSE THINGS THAT ARE AVERSIVE FEET A DEAD BODIES A DISGUSTING THINGS TO MOST PEOPLE AND TRUE FETISHES IN THE PATHOLOGIC SENSE A EXIST WHEN PEOPLE HAVE IT A BASICALLY REQUIREMENT FOR THINKING ABOUT OR EVEN THE PRESENCE OF THOSE A ORDINARILY DISGUSTING THINGS IN ORDER TO BECOME SEXUALLY AROUSED AS IF THE CIRCUITRY HAS CROSSED OVER AND THEIRE THE STATEMENT THAT WRONG MY MIND WAS PEOPLE DON'T DEVELOP FETISHES TO MAIL BOXES OR TO THE COLOR RED OR TO RANDOM OBJECTS IN THINGS THEY DEVELOP FETISHES TO THINGS THAT ARE HIGHLY INFECTIOUS AND COUNTER REPRODUCTIVE OPPETITIVE STATES SO I I FIND THAT INTERESTING I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY REFLECTIONS ON THAT AS TO WHY THAT MAGH BE A I'M TEMPT TOD TO ASK WITH AN I YOUVE EVER OBSERVED A FETISH LIKE BEHAVIOR IN MICE BUT A I FIND IT FASCINATING THAT YOU HAVE THIS AREA OF THE BRAIN THAT SO HIGHLY CAN SERVE THE HYPOTHALEMAS WHICH YOU HAVE THESE DENSE POPULATIONS INTERMIXED AND THAT THE ADDITION OF A FOREBRAIN IT ESPECIALY IN HUMANS THAT CAN THINK AN MAKE DECISIONS COULD IN SOME WAYS FACILITATE THESE THE EXPRESSION OF THESE PRIMITIVE BEHAVIORS BUT COULD ALSO COMPLICATE THE EXPRESSION OF PRIMITIVE BEHAVIORS RIGT I  I WOULD AGREE I THINK ONE WAY OF LOOKING AT FETISHES FROM A NERBIOLOGICAL STANDPOINT IS THAT THEY REPRESENT A KIND OF A HEADITIVE CONDITIONING WHERE SOMETHING THAT IS NATIVELY AVERSIVE OR DISGUSTING BI BEING REPEATEDLY HAIRED WITH A REWARDING EXPERIENCE CHANGES IT'S VAILANCE ITS SIN SO THAT NOW IT SOMEHOW PRODUCES THE ANTICIPATION OF REWARD THE NEXT TIME A PERSON SEASON I KNOW HOW  I DON'T KNOW THAT LITERATURE IN ANIMAL SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU COULD CONDITION A MOUSE TO EAT FESIES FOR EXAMPLE ALTHOUGH THERE ARE ANIMALS THAT ARE NATURALLY COPROFAG THAT IS IN MAYBE MICE DO THAT OCCASIONALLY I'M NOT SURE BUT A THAT IS ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT AND THAT COULD CERTAINLY INVOLVE IN HUMANS THE MORE RECENTLY OF ALL PARTS OF THE BRAIN THE QUARTEX THAT IS SOR OF ORCHISTRATING BOTH WHAT BEHAVIORS ARE HAPPENING AND WHETHER REWARD STATES ARE TURNING ON IN ASSOCIATION WITH THOSE BEHAVIORS THAT ARE HAPPENING AND THAT'S THE THAT'S THE PART THAT I THINK IS DIFFICULT IN CHALLENGING TO STUDY IN A MOUSE BUT A CERTAINLY CERTAINLY BEARS THINKING ABOUT BECAUSE IT'S A REALLY INTERESTING AGAIN SOR O COUNTER INTUITIVE ASPECT AGAIN LIKE ROUGH SECTS PEOPLE THAT WANT TO HAVE FIGHTING OR VIOLENCE OR AGRESSIVENESS IN ORDER TO BE SEXUALLY AROUSE AND A A FETTISHES IN FACT THAT WHEN WE MADE THAT DISCOVERY INISHALLY IT IT RAISE THE QUESTION M I MIND WHETHER A SOME PEOPLE THAT AOUR OR SEREAL RAPISTS FOR EXAMPLE A ENGAGEIN SECUAL VIOLENCE MIGHT IN SOME LEVEELL HAVE THEIR WIRES CROSSED IN SOME WAY THAT THAT THESE STATES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE PRETTY MUCH SEPARATED AND MUTUALLY ANTAGONISTIC ARE NOT IN OUR ACTUALLY MORE REWARDING AND REENFORCING A I THINK IT'S GAN TO BE A LONG TIME BEFORE WE HAVE FIGURED IT OUT BUT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT THERE IS KNOW TREATMENT THAT WE HAVE FOR A VIOLENT SECUAL OFFENDER THAT ELIMINATES THE VIOLENCE BUT NOT THE SEXUAL DESIRE AND SEXUAL URGE WHETHER IT'S PHYSICAL CASTERATION OR CHEMICAL CASTERATION IT ELIMINATES BOTH DEFILEANAREA THAT I THINK WI HUMAN NARO SCIENCE IN GENERAL NEEDS A LOT OF A TOOLS I A IN TERMS OF HAD O PROBE AND AMANIPULATE NERAL CIRCUIATURY I'D LOVE TO TURN TO THIS AREA THAT YOU MENTION THE MEDIAL PREOPTIC AREA A I'M FASCINATED BY IT BECAUSE JUST AS WITHIN THE VIAM ATES YOU HAVE THESE NURONS FOR MATING AND FIGHTING REGRESSION A MINOR STANDING IS MEDIAL PREOPTIC AREA A CONTAINE NURANS FOR MATING BUT ALSO FOR TEMPERATURE REGULATION AND PERHAPS I'M MAKING TOO MUCH OF A LEAP HERE BUT I'AVE ALWAYS WONDERED ABOUT THIS PHRASE IN HEAT A AS CERTAINLY THE A MENSTRAL AND A OR ESTRA CYCLE IN FEMALES IS RELATE TO CHANGE S EMBODY TEMPERATURE THAT MEASURING BODY TEMPEATURES ONE WAY THAT WOMINGCON VARILY RELIABLY PREDICTOPULATION ET CETERA ALTHOUGH ADDITIONAL THIS IS NOT A SHOW ABOUT CONTRACEPTION PLEASE RELY A MULTIBLE METHODS HAS NECESSARY DON'T USE THIS DISCUSSION AS YOURE A GUIDE FOR CONTRACUPSION BASED ON TEMPERATURE BUT IF YOU STIMULATE CERTAIN NURONS IN THE MEDIAL PREOPTIC AREA YOU CAN TRIGGER DRAMATIC CHANGES ENBODY TEMPERATURE AND OR MATING BEHAVIOR WHAT'S THE RELATIONSHIP IF ANY BETWEEN TEMPERATURE AND MATING REDUE SIMPLY NOT KNOW AH I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RELATIONSHIP IS BETWEEN TEMPERATURE AND MATING NURONS IN THE PREOPTIC AREA A I SUSPECT THAT THEY ARE DIFFEREN POPULATIONS OF NURONS BECAUSE IT'S BECOME PRETTY CLEAR THAT THE PREOPTIC AREA HAS MANY DIFFERENT SUBSETS OF NURANS THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY ACTIVE DURING DIFFERENT BEHAVIORS EVEN DIFFERENT PHASES OF MATING BEHAVE SO THERE ARE MOUNTING NURONS THERE INTERMISSION THRUSTING NURANS AND EJACULATION NURONS AND SNIFFING NURON WEWAT SO I I ID THINK I'VE HEARD THIS BEFORE BUT I JUST WONE TO MAKE SURE THAT YE WILL GET THIS I WONT MAKE SURE I GET THIS SO YOUR TELLING ME WITHIN ME TO MNT THIN MEDIAL PREOPTICARY THEIR SPECIFIC NURONS THAT IF YOU STIMULATE THEM WILL MAKE MALES THRUST AS IF THEIRE MADING NO SO SO THIS IS NOT BASED A ON ON STIMULATION EXPERIMENTS IS BASED ON IMAGING EXPERIMENTS RIGSTS NOW THAT WE SEE WHEN WE LOOK IN THE PREOPTIC AREA AT WHAT NURANS ARE ACTIVE DURING DIFFERENT PHASES OF AGGRESSION WE SEE THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT NURANS THAT ARE ACTIVE DURING SNIFFING MOUNTING THRUSTING AND EJACULATION THEY BECOME REPEATEDLY ACTIVATED EACH TIME THE ANIMAL GOES THROUGH THAT CITERING MATING DURING THE MATING CYCLE THERE ARE ALSO SOME NURONSZER THAT ARE ACTIVE DURING AGGRESSION WHICH ARE DITINCT AND WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THOSE NURANS ARE THERE TO PROMOTE AGGRESSION OR TO INHIBIT MATING WHEN ANIMALS ARE FIGHTING WE HAVE SOME EVIDENCE THAT SUGGESTIT MAY BE THE LATTER BUT WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE YET THE THE THERMOSENSITIVE NURANS ARE REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE YOU MENTION A THE PHRASE IN HEAT AND THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF AGGRESSION YOU TALK ABOUT HOT BLOODED PEOPLE OR HOT HEADS THERE IS JUST RECENTLY A PAPER SHOWING THERE ARE THERMO REGULATORY NURANS IN VEHEMACH AS WELL SO ALL OF THESE HOMEOSTATIC SYSTEMS FOR METABOLIC CONTROL AND TEMPERATURE CONTROL ARE INTERMINGLED IN THESE NUCLII THESE ZONES THAT CONTROL THESE BASIC SURVIVAL BEHAVIOURS LIKE MATING AND AGGRESSION AND PREDITOR DEFENCE AND I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THE THERMOREGULATION IS TIGHTLY CONNECTED TO ENERGY EXPENDITURE A AND AND THAT AGAIN THESE NURANS ARE MIXED TOGETHER TO FACILITATE INTO GRATION OF ALL THESE SIGNALS BY THE BRAIN IN SOME WAY THAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND TO MAINTAIN THE PROPER BALANCE BETWEEN ENERGY CONSERVATION AND ENERGY AN SUMPTION DURING THIS PARTICULAR BEHAVIOUR OR THAT BEHAVIOR MAY IAVE ALWAYS BEEN FASCINATED BY THE QUESTION WHY IS IT THAT A VIOLENCE GOES UP IN THE SUMMER TIME WHEN THE TEMPERATURES ARE HIGH DOES IT REALLY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE IDEA THAT INCREASE TEMPERATURE INCREASES VIOLENCE SEEMS HARD TO BELIEVE BECAUSE WHERE HOMEO THERMIC AND WE PRETTY MUCH STAY AROUND NINETY EIGHT POINT SIX FARENHITE A COULD BE OTHER SOCIAL REASONS WHY THAT HAPPENS PEOPLE ARE OUTSIDE OUT ON THE STREET BUMPING INTO EACH OTHER BUT I THINK THERE COULD WELL BE SOMETHING THAT IES THERMOREGULATION TO AGGRESSIVENESS AS WELL AS TO A MATING BEHAVIOR FASCINATING GA I AS A IN THE HOPES THAT IN MAY BE IN THE YEARS TO COME MERE LABO PART SOME OF THE TEMPERATURE RELATIONSHIPS IT AT I REALIZE IT COULD BE ALSO A REGULATED BY HORMONS IN GENERAL SO ITS TAPPING INTO TWO SYSTEMS FOR COMPLETELY DIFFERENT REASONS BUT A ANYWAY AT ANAREA THAT THAT ININTREATES ME BECAUSE OF THIS NOTION OF HOT HEADED IS I CHOOL COMMON COLLECTED AND ALSO A THE FACT THAT I PR BE SHOULD HAVE ASKED ABOUT THIS EARLIER THAT AROUSAL ITSELF IS TETHERED TO TH WHOLE MADING IM REPRODUCTIVE PROCESS  N WITHOUT A SORT OF SEA SAWING BACK BETWEEN THE SYMPATHETIC OMPARISYMPATHETIC A AROUSAL RELAXED STATES THERE IS NO MATING THAT WILL TAKE PLACE A SO IT'S FASCINATING THE WAY THESE DIFFERENT COMPETING FORCES IN SEASAW US OPERATE SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE DISCUSSION SO FAR WE'VE A HIT ON THIS IDEA THAT THE SAME BEHAVIOR CAN REFLECT DIFFERENT STATES AND DIFFERENT STATES CAN CONVERGE ON A MULTIBLE BEHAVIORS AS WELL YOU HAD A PAPER NOT LONG AGO ABOUT MOUNTING BEHAVIOR A WHICH I FOUND FASCINATING A MAYBE COULD TELL US ABOUT THAT RESULT BECAUSE TO ME IT REALLY SPEAKS TO THE FACT THAT MOUNTING BEHAVIOR CAN IN ONE CONTAXT BE SEXUAL AN ANOTHER CONTAXTS ACTUALLY BE RELATED TO WE PRESUME DOMINANCE AND I THINK THAT A MY FRIENDS A WHO PRACTISE JUGITZ A WILL SAY THEY WHEN I TALK ABOUT THAT RESULT THIY SAY OF COURSE YOU KNOW MOUNTING THE OTHERS IN   DOMINATING THEM IT'S THERE'S NOTHING SEXUAL ABOUT IT IT'S ABOUT OVERTAKING THEM PHYSICALLY LITERALLY BEING ON THEIR NEXT SIDE AS OPPOSED TO ON THEIR OWN LYING ON THEIR OWN BACK A AFASCINATING VERY PRIMITIVE AND YET A I THINK SPEAC THIS IDEA THAT MOUNTING BEHAVIOR MIGHT BE ONE OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL WAYS IN WHICH ANIMALS IN PERHAPS EVEN HUMANS EXPRESS DOMINANCE END OR SEXUAL INTERACTIONS YE AND THAS AFASCINATING QUESTION AND IT WAS HARDER TO FIGURE OUT THAN YOU MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT SO WE'VE THERE'S BEEN THIS DEBATE FOR A LONG TIME IN THE FIELD WHEN YOU SEE TO MALE MACE MET MICE MOUNTING EACH OTHER IS THIS HOMOSEXUALBEHAVIOR IS THIS A CASE OF MISTAKEN SEXUAL IDENTIFICATION OR IS THIS DOMINANCE BEHAVIOR AND IF YOU TRAIN AN A I ALGARYTHM TO TRY TO DISTINGUISH A MALE MALE MOUNTING FROM MALE FEMALE MOUNTING IT DOES NOT DO A VERY GOOD JOB BECAUSE MOTORICALLY THOSE BEHAVIORS LOOK SO SIMILAR AND SO A HOW DID WE WIND UP FIGURING OUTS THAT MOST MALE MALE MOUNTING IS DOMINANCE MOUNTING THER TWO IMPORTANT CLUES ONE IS THE CONTEXT AND SO MALE MALE MOUNTING TENDS TO BE MORE PROMINENT AMONG MICE WHEN THEY HAVEN'T HAD A LOT OF FIGHTING EXPERIENCE AND THEN AS THEY BECOME MORE EXPERIENCED AND FIGHTING THEY WILL SHOW RELATIVELY LESS MOUNTING TOWARDS THE OTHER MALE AND MORE ATTACK UNTIL TRANSITION QUICKLLY FROM MOUNTING TO ATTACK AND SO THE MOUNTING IS ALWAYS SEEN IN THIS ONTAXT OF AN OVERALL AGGRESSIVE INTERACTION AND THEN THE SECOND THING WHICH BELIEVE IT ARE NOT WIT SUGGESTED BY A COMPUTATIONAL THEORETICAL PERSON IN MY LAB AND KENNEDY  WHO NOW IS R OWN LABAT NORTH WESTERN SHE SAID WELL MALES ARE KNOWN TO SING WHEN THEY MOUNT FEMALES ULTROSONIC VOCALIZATIONS WHY DON'T YOU SEE WHAT KINDS OF SONGS THEIRE SINGING WHEN THEIR MOUNTING MALES MAY BE IT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF SONG WILL WE FOUND OUT AS THEY DON'T SING AT ALL WHEN THEI'R MOUNTING A MALE SO YOU CAN EASILY DISTINGUISH WHETHER MOUNTING BEHAVIOR BY A MALE MOUSE IS REPRODUCTIVE OR AGONISTIC AGGRESSIVE ACCORDING TO WHETHER IT'S ACCOMPANIED BY LTROSONIC VOCALIZATIONS OR NOT AND IT TURNS OUT THAT DIFFERENT BRAIN REGIONS ARE MAXIMALLY ACTIVE DURING THESE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MOUNTING SO V M AH THE AGGRESSION LOCUS IS ACTUALLY ACT IVE DURING DOMINANCE MOUNTING AND YOU CAN STIMULATE MOUNTING IF YOU DOMINOUS MOUNTING IF YOU WEAKLY ACTIVATE V M H WERE AS EMPIO A IS MOST STRONGLY ACTIVATED DURING SEXUAL MOUNTING AND THAT'S ALWAYS ACCOMPANIED BY THE ULTROSONIC VOCALIZATION SO THIS SHOWS HOW DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS IT CAN BE TO TRY TO INFER AND ANIMALS STATE OR INTENT OR EMOTION FROM THE BEHAVIOR THAT IT'S EXHIBITING BECAUSE THE SAME BEHAVIOUR CAN MEAN VERY DIFFERENT THINGS DEPENDING ON THE CONTEXT OF THE INTERACTION WITH THE ANIMAL NOWS A EVEN MORE SO WITH WHEN THAT ANIMAL IS A A HUMAN OR OR IS MULTIPLE HUMANS THAT'S RIGHT AND THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES YOU KNOW ANIMALS SHOW CHASING TO OBTAIN FOOD A PREY ANIMAL THAT THEY'RE GEN TO KILL AND EAT AND THEY SHOW CHASING TO OBTAIN A MATE THAT THERE CAN HAVE SEX WITH AND SO THE INTENT OF THE CHASING IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AND WE DON'T KNOW IN ALL THESE CASES WHETHER THERE ARE SEPARATE CIRCUITS OR COMMENT CIRCUITS THAT ARE BEING ACTIVATED I'M OBSESS WITH DOGS AND DOG BREEDS AND ET CETERA ET CETERA AND A ONE THING I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT FEMALE DOGS WILL MOUNT AND THRUST WE HAD A FEMALE PITBLL MIX VERY SWEET DOG A BUT IN OBSERVING HER IT CAN IT CONVINCED ME THAT ONE CAN NEVER ASSUME THAT MALE DOGS ARE MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN FEMALE DOGS IT THERE'S A IT TURNS OUT IN TALKING IF YE WORD IS QUITE SKILLED IT DOGINETICS AND DOG BREEDING THAT THERE IS A DOMINANTE IREKEY WITHIN A LITTER AND IT CROSSES OVER MALE FEMALE A DELINEATIONS SO YOUAN GET A FEMALE IN THE LETTER THAT'S VERY DOMINANT A MALE ET'S VERY SUBORDINATE AND IT NO ONE REALLY MALES WHAT WHAT RELATES TO THIS ALSO BY LITTLE DOGS SOMETIMES WILL WELL GET RIGHT UP IN THE FACE OF A BIG DOBERMEN PINTURE AND JUST OUR BARKING WHICH IS A IDIOTIC THING FOR IT TO DO BUT THEY CAN E THEY CAN BE DOMINANT OVER A MUCH LARGER DOG VERY STRANGE A TO ME ANYWAY FEMALE FEMALE MOUNTING DYOU OBSERVE IT IN MICE A ARE THERE KNOWN CIRCUITS AND O WHAT EVOKES FEMALE FEMALE MOUNTING OR FEMALE TO MALE MOUNTING IF IF IT OCCURS GOOD YES THERE IS FEMALE THERE ARE CLEAR EXAMPLES OF FEMALES DISPLAYING MALE TYPE MOUNTING BEHAVIOR TOWARDS OTHER FEMALES WE SEE THIS MOST COMMONLY IN THE LAB WHERE WE ARE HOUSING FEMALES WITH THEIR SISTERS SAY THREE OR FORENA CAGE WE TAKE ONE OUT AND WE HAVE HER MATE WITH E MALE WHERE THE MALES DOING THE MOUNTING NOW WE TAKE THAT FEMALE AND WE PUT HER BACK IN THE CAGE WITH HER LITER MATES AND SHE STARTS MOUNTING THEM ANWHAT THE FUNCTION OF THAT IS IF IT HAS ANY FUNCTION OR WHAT IT MEANS WHAT'S DRIVING IT WE DON'T KNOW BUT WE DO MOWE THAT IF WE STIMULATE THE MOUNT THE NURANTO CONTROL MOUNTING IN MALES IN THE MEDIAL PREOPTIC AREA IF WE STIMULATE THAT SAME POPULATION IN FEMALES IT EVOKES MALE TYPE MOUNTING TOWARDS EITHER A MALE OR A FEMALE TARGET IN FACT WE HAVE A MOVI WHERE WE HAVE A FEMALE THAT HAS JUST BEEN MOUNTED BY A MALE SO THE MALES ON TOP AND SHE'S UNDERNEATH AND WE STIMULATE THOSE THAT RESION OF EMPEAWA IN THE FEMALE AND SHE ROWLS OUT FROM UNDERNEATH THE MALE WHO IS JUST MOUNTED HER CIRCLES AROUND BEHIND HIM AND CLIMBS UP ON TOP OF HIM AND STARTS TO TRY TO MOUNT HIM AND THRUST AT HIM THAT HAS A NAME ON LINE IT'S CALLED A SWITCH TE DON'T ASK ME HOW I KNOW THAT O GA BUT IT'S A PRETTY YAIT'S A IT'S A TERM LET THAT YE HEAR A YOU'LSO HEAR THAT THE THE TERM TOPPING FROM THE BOTTOM WHICH IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT IS A LITERAL TOPPING FOR I OBTY THAT'S A MORD OF A PSYCHOLOGICAL PHRASE FROM WHAT I HEAR IV FRIENDS THAT ARE ARE EDUCATING ME IN THIS A LANGUAGE MOSTLY BECAUSE I FIND THIS KIND OF NORBIOLOGICAL DISCUSSION FASCINATING AT SOME POINT RIGHT IT WE I ATTEMPT IN MY MIND TO SUPERIMPOSE OBSERVATIONS FROM THE THE ONLINE COMMUNITYS THAT I'M TOLD ABOUT AND ASKED ABOUT I'M TO THIS BUT I WISH SHOE POINT OUT IT'S ALWAYS DANGEROUS AND AND IN IN FACT IN A PARBY TO MAKE A ONE TO ONE LEA LINK YOU KDONT A HUMANS ARE THEY MAINTAIN ALL THE SAME NERAL CIRCUITORY IN PATHWAYS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TO DAY AND MICE BUT A THAT FOREBRAIN DOES A ALLOW FOR CONTEXT ET CETERA SO WHAT THE FUNCTION IS OF A OF A FEMALE MOUNTING I DON'T KNOW IT COULD BE A TYPE OF DOMINANCE DISPLAY IT'S HARD TO MEASURE THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVEN'T WORKED ON FEMALE DOMINANTS HIERARCHIES TO THE SAME EXTENT THAT THEY'VE WORKED ON MALE DOMINANTS HIERARCHIES BUT IT INDICATES THAT THE CIRCUITS FOR MALE YPE MOUNTING ARE THERE IN FEMALES AS A EARLY WORK FROM CATHERINE DOLOCH SUGGESTED SOME YEARS AGO FASCINATING FASCINAI I LOVE THAT PAPER BECAUSE AS YOU POINT OUT FOR CHASE YOU KNOW THIT A FOR MOUNT TING BEHAVIOUR AND WE SEE IT AND WE THINK ONE THING SPECIFICALLY AM AN AFTER HEARING THIS RESOLED ISHE I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF OF FIGHT SPORTS I WATCH THEM OCCASIONALLY CAUS FRIENDS ARE INTO THEM BUT I I'VE SEEN BOXING MATCH IS AM  A MA MATCH IS WERE AT THE END OF A ROUND IF SOME ONE FELT THAT THEY DOMINATED THEY WILL DO THE UNSPORTSMEN LIKE THING OF A THRUSTING ON THE BACK OF THE OTHER PERSO RLITYG OFF ALMOST LIKE IDOMINATED YOU AND I KNOW IT SO MIMICING SECUAL LIKE BEHAVIOR BUT THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK THAT ITS SEXUAL BUT THERE SENDING A MESSAGE OF DOMINANCE IS WHAT WHAT IMPLIES I'D LOVE TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING AM SLIGHTLY OFF FROM THE CIRCUITRY BUT I THINK THAT'S RELATED TO THE CIRCUITRY AT LEAST IN SOME WAY WHICH IS THIS STRUCTURE THAT I'VE ALWAYS BEEN FASTENING BY AND I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT THE HEL IT'S FOR  SEEMS TO BE INVOLVED IN EVERYTHING WHICH IS THE P A G THE PERIAQUEDUCTAL GRAY IC' L BET FURTHER BACK IN THE BRAIN FOR PEOPLE DON'T KNOW IT'S BEEN STUDYIN THE CONTECTS A PAIN IT'S BEEN STUDIED IN THE CONTECTS OF THE SO CALLED LORD DOSES RESPONSE THO THE RECEPTIVITY OR ARCHING OF THE BACK OF THE FEMALE TO RECEIVE INTERMISSION AND MADING FROM THE MALE HOW SHALL WE THINK ABOUT P A G AM CLEARLY CAN'T BE INVOLVED IN IT EVERYTHING I'M GESSING IT'S AT LEAST AS COMPLEX AS SOME OF THESE OTHER REGIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING BOUT DIFFERENT TYPES OF NURON'S CONTROLLING DIFFERENT THINGS BUT HOW DOES P  G PLAY INTO THIS IN PARTICULAR I ONE I KNOW IS THERE'S SOME MECHANISM OF PAIN MODULATION IND CONTROL DURING FIGHTING AND OR MADING AND THE REASON I ASK IS THAT IM WHILE I'M NOT A COMBAT SPORTS PERSON YEARS AGO I DI DITTAL OL BIT OF MARSHAL ITS AND IT ALWAYS WAS A IMPRESSIVE TO ME HOW LITTLE IT HURT TO GET PUNCHED DURING A FIGHT AND HOW MUCH IT HURT AFTERWARDS RIGHT SO THERE CLEARLY AS SOME INDOGINOUS PAIN CONTROL AM THAT THEN WEARS OFF AND THEN YOU FEEL BEAT UP AM ERELEAS IN MY CASE I FELT BEAT UP WHAT'S P  G DOING VS V PAIN AND VS V AND WHAT'S PAIN DOING VESE OF EV THESE OTHER BEHAVIORS GOOD GOOD SO SO I THINK OF P  G LIKE A OLD FASHION TELEPHONE SWITCHBOARD WERE THERE ARE THERE CALLS COMING IN AND THEN THE CABLES HAVE TO BE PUNCHED IN TO THE RIGHT WHOLE TO GET THE INFORMATION TO BE ROUTED TO THE RIGHT RECIPIENT ON THE OTHER END OF IT A BECAUSE PRETTY MUCH EVERY TYPE OF INNATE BEHAVIOR YOU CAN THINK OF HAS HAD THE PAG IMPLICATED THERE'S A WHOLE LITERATURE A SHOWING THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE PAG IN FEAR DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE PAG THE DORSAL PAG IS INVOLVED IN PANIC LIKE BEHAVIOR RUNNING AWAY THE VENTRAL PAG IS INVOLVED IN FREEZING BEHAVIOR A THE BOTH THE MP AWAY AND V M H SEND PROJECTIONS TO THE PAG TO DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE PAG SO IN CROSS SECTION I HATE TO SAY THIS BUT IN CROSSECTION THE PAG IND LOOKS LIKE THE WATER IN A TOILET WHEN YOU'RE ST ANDING OVER AND OPEN TOILET BOWL AND IF YOU IMAGION A CLOC FACE PROJECTED ON TO THAT IT'S LIKE THE PAG HAS SECTORS FROM ONE TO TWELVE MAY BE EVEN MORE OF THEM AND IN EACH OF THOSE SECTORS YOU FIND DIFFERENT NURANS FROM THE HYPOTHALYMUS ARE PROJECTING SO COULD TURN OUT THAT THERE IS A TOPIGRAPHIC ARRANGEMENT ALONG THE DORSO VENTRAL AXIS OF THE PAG AND THE MEDIOLATERAL AXIS OF THE PAG THAT DETERMINES THAT TYPE OF BEHAVIOUR THAT WILL BE EMITTED WHEN NURANS IN THAT REGED IN ARE STIMULATED ND I THINK SOR OF ALL OF THE EVIDENCE IS POINTING IN THAT DIRECTION BUT BY KNO MEANS HAS IT BEEN MAPPD OUT NOW THE THING THAT YOU MENTIOND ABOUT A IT NOT HURTING WHEN YOU GOT BEAT UP DURING MARTIAL ARTS THERE IS A WELL KNOWN PHENOMENON CALLED FEAR INDUCED A ANALGESIA WHERE WHEN AN ANIMAL IS IN A HIGH STATE OF FEAR LIKE IF ITS TRYING TO DEFEND ITSELF THERE IS A A SUPPRESSION OF PAIN RESPONSES AND I'M NOT SURE COMPLETELY ABOUT THE MECHANISMS AND HOW WELL THATS UNDERSTOOD BUT FOR EXAMPLE A THE THE ADRENAL GLAND HAS A PEPTIDE IN IT THAT IS RELEASED FROM THE A DRENAL MEDULLA WHICH CONTROLS THE FYTER FLIGHT RESPONSES AND THAT PEPTIDE HAS ANALGESIC ACTIVITIES NASR THAT PEPTA IS CALLED BOVINE A DRENAL MEDULARY PEPTIDE OF TWENTY TWO AMENOACID RESIDUES AND I ONLY KNOW ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT ACTIVATES A RECEPTR THAT WE DISCOVERED MANY YEARS AGO THAT'S INVOLVED IN PAIN AND WE THOUGHT IT PROMOTED PAIN BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT THIS ACTUALLY INHIBOTS PAINITS LIKE AN INDOGENOUS ANALGESIC WHETHER THIS IS HAPPENING THIS TYPE OF A OF ANALGESIA IS HAPPENING WHEN AN ANIMAL IS ENGAGED IN OFFENSIVE AGGRESSION OR IN MADING BEHAVIOUR I DON'T KNOW BUT IT CERTAINLY IS POSSIBLE AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THESE A ANALGESIC MECHANISMS ARE HAPPENING IN THE PAG THEY COULD ALSO BE HAPPENING A LITTLE FURTHER DOWN IN THE SPINAL CORD THE PAG IS REALLY CONTINUOUS WITH THE SPINAL CORD IF YOU JUST FOLLOW IT DOWN TOWARDS THE TAL OF AN ANIMAL YOU WILL WIND UP IN THE SPINAL CORD AND A A AND SO IT COULD BE THAT THERE ARE INFLUENCES ACTING AT MANY LEVELS ON PAIN IN THE PAG AND IN THE SPINAL COURT AS WELL AND IT MAY WELL BE KNOWN I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT IT DISTINGUISHED CLEARLE BETWEEN THINGS THAT ARE NOT KNOWN THAT I KNOW ARE UNKNOWN WHICH IS IT A FAIRLY SMALL AREA WHERE I HAVE EXPERTEES FROM THINGS THAT MAY BE KNOWN BUT I'M IGNORANT OF THEM BECAUSE I JUST DON'T HAVE A BROAD ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE BASE TO NOAWE APPRECIATE AM IDOES DELINE ATIONS A THANK YOU A PAGSO I THINK THIS DESCRIPTION OF IS IT OLD FASHION TELEP OPHONES WHICH BORD AND A AND NOW EVERY TIME I LOOK INTO THE TOILET I'LL THINK ABOUT THE PARIAE I NEVERY TIME I SEE IN IMAGE OF PARY I O I O GAA A ABOUT A TOI THAT IS TAT ATA A NOT DESCRIPTION A BECAUSE IDN FACTI DREW A CIRCLTHINGA A A WELL I'LL PUT UP POSE AT A LINK TO A PICTURE OF PIAGI AND YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHY WHY DAVID AND I ARE CHUCKLING HAIR BECAUSE INDEED IT LOOKS LIKE A TOILET A WHEN STARING INTO A TOILET TELL US ABOUT TAKI KINAN IVE TALKED ABOUT THIS A COUPLE TIMES ON DIFFERENT PODCASS EPISODES BECAUSE A IT'S RELATIONSHIP TO SOCIAL ISOLATION AND A IN PART BECAUSE THE PODCAS WAS LAUNCH DURING A TIME WHEN THERE WAS MORE SOCIAL ISOLATION A MINORSANY IS THAT TAKI KINAN AND YOU'LL TELL US WHAT IT IS IN MOMENT A ITS PRESENT IN FLIES IN MICE AND INHUMANS AND MAY DO SIMILAR THINGS IN THOSE SPECIES THAT'S RIGHT SO TAKI KINAN IS A REFERS TO A FAMILY OF RELATED NEURO PEPTIDES SO THESE ARE BRAIN CHAMICALS A THERE DIFFERENT FROM DOPAMINE AN CERATONAN IN THAT THERE NOT SMALL ORGANIC MOLECULES THEIRE ACTUALLY SHORT PIECES OF PROTINE THAT ARE DIRECTLY INCODED BY GENES THAT ARE ACTIVE IN SPECIFIC NERANS AND NOT IN OTHERS AND WHEN THOSE NEURONS ARE ACTIVE THOSE NEURO PEPTIDES ARE RELEASED TOGETHER WITH CLASSICAL TRANSMITTERS LIKE LUDIMATE WHATEVER TAKI KINANS HAVE BEE FAMOUSLY IMPLICATED IN PAIN PETACT PARTICULARLY TAKI KNAN ONE WHICH IS CALLED SUBSTANCE PE ONE OF THE ORIGINAL HAIN MODULATING THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ROMOTES IN FLAMATORY PAIN BUT THERE ARE OTHER TAKI KINANGENES IN MICE THERE ARE TWO IN HUMANS I THINK THERE THREE AND A IN DRYSOPHL OF THEIREIS ONE AND THE WAY WE GOT INTO TAKI KINANS IS FROM STUDYING AGGRESSION IN FLIES WE THOUGHT SINCE NEURO PEPTIDES HAVE THIS REMARKABLE PARALLEL EVOLUTIONARY CONSERVATION OF STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION LIKE NEUROPEPTIDE Y CONTROLS FEEDING IN WORMS IN FLIES AND MICE AND IN PEOPLE OCITOSEN LIKE PEPTIDES CONTROL REPRODUCTION IN WORMS AND MICE AND IN PEOPLE WE THOUGHT WE MIGHT FIND EPTIDES AT CONTROL AGGRESSION IN FLIES IN A PEOPLE AND SO WE DID A A SCREEN UNBY A SCREEN OF PEPTIDES AND FOUND IN DEED THAT ONE OF THE TAKI KINANS TRYSOPHLATAKI KINAN THOSE NURONS WHEN YOU ACTIVATE THEM STRONGLY PROMOTE AGGRESSION AND IT DEPENDS ON THE RELEASE OF TAKI CINAN NOW THE INTERESTING THING IS THAT IN FLIES JUST LIKE IN PEOPLE AND PRACTICALLY ANY OTHER SOCIAL ANIMAL THAT SHOWS AGGRESSION SOCI LL ISOLATION INCREASES AGGRESSIVENESS SO PUTTING A A A VIOLENT PRISONER AND SOLITARY CONFINEMENT IS ABSELY THE WORST MOST COUNTER PRODUCTIVE THING YOU COULD DO TO THEM AND INDEED WE FOUND IN FLIES THAT SOCIAL ISOLATION INCREASES THE LEVEL OF TAKI KINAN IN THE BRAIN AND IF WE SHUT THAT GEN DOWN IT PREVENTS THE ISOLATION FROM INCREASING AGGRESSION SO SINCE MY LAB ALSO WORKS ON MICE IT WAS NATURAL TO SEE WHETHER TAKI KINANS MIGHT BE UPREGULATED AND SOCIAL ISOLATION AND WHETHER THEY PLAY A ROLL IN AGGRESSION AND THIS IS WORK DONE BY A FORMER POSTOCMORIAL ZELICOVSKI NOW AT UNIVERSEY ASALIC CITY IN UTAH AND SHE FOUND REMARKABLY THAT WHEN MICE ARE SOCIALLY ISOLATED FOR TWO WEEKS THERE IS THIS MASSIVE UPREGULATION OF TAKI KINAN TO IN THEIR BRAIN IN FACK IF YOU TAG THE PEPTIDE WITH A GREEN FLORESCENT PROTINE FROM A JELLY FISH GENETICALLY THE BRAIN LOOKS GREEN WHEN THE MICE ARE SOCIALLY ISOLATED IS THERE SO MUCH OF THIS STUFF RELEASED AND SHE WENT ON TO SHOW THAT THAT INCREASE INTAKI KINAN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EFFECTIVE SOCIAL ISOLATION TO INCREASE AGGRESSIVENESS AND T INCREASE FEAR AND TO INCREASE ANXIETY AND EFFACT THERE ARE DRUGS THAT BLOCK THE RECEPTER FOR TAKI KINAN WHICH WERE TESTED IN HUMANS AND ABANDONED BECAUSE THEY HAD NO EFFICACY IN THE TESTS THAT THEY WERE A ANALYZE FOR IF YOU GIVE THOSE DRUGS TO A SOCIALLY ISOLATED MOUSE IT BLOCKS ALL OF THE EFFECTS OF SOCIAL ISOLATION IT BLOCKS THE AGGRESSION IT BLOCKS THE INCREASED FEAR AND THE INCREASED ANXIETY AND THAT MORIAL DESCRIBED AT THE MICE JUST LOOK CHILL ITS NOT A SEDITIVE WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANCE NOT THAT THE MICE RGOING TO SLEEP MOST REMARKABLY IS ONCE YOU SOCIALLY ISOLATE A MOUSE AND IT BECOMES AGGRESSIVE YOU CAN NEVER PUT IT BACK IN ITS CAGE WITH ITS BROTHERS FROM ITS LITTER BECAUSE IT WILL KILL THEM ALL OVERNIGHT BUT IF YOU GIVE IT THIS DRUG WHICH IS CALLED OSANATAN THAT BLACK BLOCKS TAKIKINAN TOO THAT MOUSE CAN BE RETURNED TO THE CAGE WITH ITS BROTHERS AND WILL NOT ATTACK THEM AND SEEMS TO BE HAPI ABOUT THAT FOR THE REST OF THE TIME SO THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY POWERFUL AFFECT OF THIS DRUG AND I BEEN REALLY INTERESTED INTRYING TO GET FARMASUITICL COMPANIES TO TEST THIS DRUG WHICH HAS A REALLY GOOD SAFETY PROFILE IN HUMANS INTESTING IT IN PEOPLE WHO ARE SUBJECTED TO SOCIAL ISOLATION STRESS OR BE REVEMENT STRESS AND THIS IS ONE OF THE AREAS WEARE I LEARNED AND I OPENING LESSON AS A BAS SIC SCIENTISTS WHO NAIVELY THOUGHT THAT IF YOU MAKE A DISCOVERY AND IT HAS TRANSLATIONAL APPLICATIONS TO HUMANS THAT FARMASICAL COMPANIES ARE GOINGT BEFALLING ALL OVER THEMSELVES TO TRY IT AND THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED BECAUSE ONCE BURNED TWICE SHY THESE DRUGS WERE TESTED FOR EFFICACY IN SKITS OPHRENIA I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THERE'S VERY LITTLE PRECLINICAL DATED TO SUGGESTS THAT NOT SURPRISINGLY THEY FAILED WHEND A A WHEN A DRUG FAILS AND CLINICAL TRIALS AND FACE THREE IT CAUST HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO THE COMPANY THAT AA THAT CARRIED OUT THAT CLINICAL TRIAL SO THERE'S A HUGE SLAG HEAP OF DISCARDED FARMISEUTICLES MANY OF THEM IN HIBITERS OF NARRO PEPTIDE ACTION THAT A COULD BE USEFUL IN OTHER INDICATION SUCH AS THE ONE WE DISCOVERED BUT THERE'S A HUGE ECONOMIC DISINCENTIVE FOR FARMISEUTICAL COMPANIES TO TEST THEM AGAIN BECAUSE THE CONCLUSION THAT THEY DREW FROM ALL THESE FAIL TESTS PARTICULARLY IN THE TWO THOUSAND TENDS AND BEFORE THAT IS THAT THE REASON THEY FAILED IS BECAUSE ANIMAL EXPERIMENTS WITH DRUGS DON'T PREDICT HOW HUMANS WILL RESPOND TO THE DRUGS AND THEREFORE WE SHOULDN'T TRY TO EXTRAPELATE FROM ANY OTHER DATA THAT WE GET FROM ANIMAL EXPERIMENTS MALCERATICPERIMENTS TO HUMANS BECAUSE THEY LEAD US DOWN THE WRONG TRACT AND I THINK THAT THAT IS PROBABLY WRONG IN SOME CASES IT MAY BE RIGHT BUT IN OTHER CASES THERE'S GOOD REASON TO THINK BECAUSE THESE BRAIN REGIONS AND MOLECULES ARE SO EVOLUTIONARILY CONSERVED THAT THEY OUGHT TO BE PLAYING A SIMILAR ROLE IN HUMANS IN FACT THERE IS A A PAPER A A SHOWING THAT IN HUMANS THAT HAVE A A BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER THERE IS A STRONG CORELATION BETWEEN THEIR SELF REPORTED LEVEL OF AGGRESSIVENESS AND SYRUM LEVELS OF ATTAKI KINAN IN THIS CASE TAKIKININ ON AS DETECTED BY RADIO MUNOASSAY THIS IS WORK OF EMO AMAL COCARO WHOS A CLINICAL PCYCHYTRIS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO SO THERE IS A SMOKING GUN IN THE CASE OF HUMANS IS WELL AND A I WAS ACTUALLY TRYING TO INTEREST OF PHARMISEUTICAL COMPANY THAT WAS TESTING THESE DRUGS ACTUALLY FOR TREATMENT OF HOT FLASHES IN FEMALES IN HUMANS WHERE THERE IS ACTUALLY GOOD ANIMAL DATA TO THINK THAT IT MIGHT BE USEFUL BUT I REALIZE THAT THIS CLINICAL TRIAL WAS GOING ON DURING THE COVED PANDEMIC AND I APPROACHMENTS AD LOOK NATURE MAY HAVE ACTUALLY DONE FOR YOU THE EXPERIMENT THAT I WANT YOU TO DO CAS SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GETTING DRUG ARE P LESS SEABO AREGOIN TO HAVE BEEN SOCIALLY ISOLATED AND SOME OF THEM WILL HAVE NOT WHY DON'T YOU GET THEM TO FILL OUT QUESTIONERIS AND SEE WHETHER THE ONES WHO WERE GIVEN THE DRUG AND SOCIALLY ISOLATED FELT LESS STREST AND LESS ANXIOUS THAN THE ONES WHO WERE NOT SOCIALLY ISOLATED AND THEY WOULD NOT TOUCH IT BECAUSE THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A CLINICAL TRIAL FOR A DIFFERENT INDICATION FOR THIS DRUG AND THEY HAVE TO REPORT ANY OBSERVATION THAT THEY MAK ABOUT THAT DRUG IN THEIR PATIENT POPULATION SO IF THEY WERE TO ASK THESE QUESTIONS AND GET AN UNFAVORABLE ANSWER OH MY GOD I FELT EVEN WORSE WHEN I TOOK THIS DRUG AND I WAS ISOLATED THEY WOULD THEY WOULD BE OBLIGED TO REPORT THAT TO THE F D E AND THAT COULD TORPEDO THE CHANCES FOR THE DRUG BEING APPROVED IN THE THING THAT IT WAS IN CLINICAL TRIALS FOR SO IS BETTER NOT TO ASK AND NOT TO KNOW A AND A THAN IT IS TO TRY TO FIND OUT MORE INFORMATION THAT COULD LEAD TO ANOTHER CLINICAL INDICATION SO I REMAIN CONVINCED THAT THIS FAMILY OF DRUGS COULD HAVE VERY POWERFUL USES IN TREATING SOME FORMS OF STRESS INDUCED ANXIETY RAGRESSIVENESS IN HUMANS BUT IT JUST VERY DIFFICULT FOR ECONOMIC REASONS TO FIND A WAY TO GET SOMEBODY TO TEST THAT YET A TRUE SHAME THAT THESE COMPANIES WON'T DO THIS AND ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT MANY THESE DRUGS EXIST AND THEIR SAFETY PROFILS ARE ESTABLISHED AS THAT'S ALWAYS A SERIOUS A CONSIDERATION WHEN EMBARKING ON A CLINICAL TRIAL PERHAPS IN HEARING THIS DISCUSSION SOMEWHONE OUT THERE WILL UNDERSTAND THE KEY IMPORTANCE OF THIS AND A WILL REACH OUT TO US WILL PROVIDE A WAYS TO DO THAT A TO GET SUCH A STUDY GOING IN HUMANS BECAUSE I THINK OF ENOUGH LABORATORIES RAN SMALLSCALE CLINICAL TRIALS FARMA CERTAINLY WOULD PRICK UP THEIR EARS RIGHT IM THERE THER SO OM STRET G UM SOMETIMES TO THEIR OWN I MAN I BOULD JUST I WOULD LIKE SAY ALSO I'D LIKE TO SEE THIS TESTED ON PETS I MEAN THERE'S A HUGE NUMBER OF PETS RIGHT NOW THAT AR SUFFERING SEPARATION ANXIETY BECAUSE HUMANS BOUGHT THEM TO KEEP THEM COMPANY DURING THE COVET PEND AND OTHEOTHER HOME ALONE EH AND IF THIS THING WORKS IN MICE IS CERTAINLY A HIGHER CHANCE ITS CAN A WORK IN DOGS OR IN CATS THAN IT IS GEN A WORK IN HUMANS AND IF IT DID THAT WOULD BE EVEN MORE ENCOURAGEMENT TO CONTINUE ALONG THOSE LINES PEOPLE SOMETIMES FORGET THAT ALTHOUGH WE WORK ON ANIMALS AND WE ULTIMATELY ONE UNDERSTAND HUMANS WE CARE ABOUT HOW OUR ARE RESULTS APPLY TO THE WELFARE OF ANIMALS AS WELL AND PARTICULARLY DOMESTIC PETS WHICH IS A BILLION MULTIBILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY IN THIS COUNTRY SO THERES WAYS IT THAT THEY CAN BE MADE TO FEEL BETTER WHEN THER SEPARATED FROM THER A THEIR OWNERS THAT WOULD CERTAINLY BE A GOOD THING ABSOLUTELY WE WILL PUT OUT THE CALL WE ARE PUTTING OUT THE CALL AND I I KNOW FOR SURE THERE WILL BE O RESPONSE JUST UNDER SCORING WHAT WEVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT EVEN MORE EVERY TIME WE HERE ABOUT A SCHOOL SHOOTING LI IN TAXAS RECENTLY OR I HAPPEN TO BE IN NEW YORK TRAING THE TIME WHEN THERE WAS A SUBWAY SHOOTING IM FOR WHATEVER REASON I LISTEN TO THE THE BOOK I ABOUT COLUMBINE THAT WHEN INTO TVERY DETAILED WAY ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF THOSE BOYS AND THAT THAT COMMITTED THAT AND EVERY SINGLE TIME THERE'S THE PERSON WHO COMMITS THOSE ACTS IS SOCIALLY ISOLATED AS FAR AS I KNOW THERE MIGHT BE SOME EXCEPTIONS THERE AND SOMETIMES THIS CROSSES OVER WITH OTHER MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES BUT SOMETIMES NO NO APPARENT I MENTAL HEALTHISHUSE SO SOCSA SOCIAL ISOLATION CLEARLY DRIVES POWERFUL NEURO CHEMICAL IN NEUROBIOLOGICAL CHANGES REALLY HOPE THAT I'M TAKI KIND IN ONE AND TWO THOSE OF THE MAIN ONE GAHUMANS WILL BE EXPLORED IM IN MORE DITA ALSO I DIDN'T KNOW THAT TAKI KIND IN ONE IS SUBSTANCE PEAN YES AS HE IS TAKI KINDYEN THAT THE TACKI KIND ON ONE IS THE GE NAME AND TACKI KIN IN TWO IN HUMANS IS CALLED NEURO KIND AN B THAT'S THE NAME OF THE PROTINE I JUST REFERRED TO IT BY THE GE NAME CAS IT MAKES IT EASIER AND I DON'T HAVE TO KEEP REMEMBERING TWO NAMES FOR EACH THING AND I IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN YOU SEE OR YOU YOU PUT YOURSELF IN THE COMPANY OF GENETISIS BECAUSE OF YOUR ORIGINAL TRAINING WAS IN GENACIMINOLOGY AND THERE IS IIT WAS INELL BIOLOGY AND I DIDN'T ACTUALLY HAVE FORMAL TRAINING IN GENETICS AS A GRADUATE STUDENT BUT I THINK I'M A GENETISIST OF HEART THAT'S JUST THE WAY I LIKE TO THINK ABOUT THINGS AND WHEN I START O WORKING ON FLIES THAT SORT OF I CAME OUT OF THE CLOSET AS A GENETISIS AS WERE WONDERFUL SALLS WERE TALKING ABOUT HUMANS I LOVE THY A YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT HUMAN STUDIES OF EMOTION I KNOW YOU WROTE THIS BOOK WITH RALPH ADE ALSE YOU HAVE THIS NEW BOOK I WHICH WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO WHICH I'VE READ FRONT TOBACK TWICE IT'S PHENOMENAL I MENTION IT WORUPOT GAS ITS REALLY THERE ARE BOOKS THAT ARE WORTH READING AND THEN THEIR BOOKS THAT ARE IMPORTANT AND I THINK THIS BOOK IS TRULY IMPORTANT FOR THE GENERAL POPULATION TO READ AND UNDERSTAND AND NURSCIENTIST SHOULD READ AND UNDERSTAND THE CONTENTS BECAUSE WE AS A AS A CULTURE ARE WAY OFF IN TERMS OF HOW WE THINK ABOUT EMOTIONS AND STATES AND BEHAVIORS SO WELL PUT A LINK TO THAT IT'S REALLY WORTH THE TIME AND ENERGY TO TO READ IT IM AND IT'S WRITTEN BEAUTIFULLY I SHOUILD SAY VERY ACCESSIBLE EVEN FOR NON SCIENTISTS THERE'S A HEAP MAP DIAGRAM IN THAT BOOK THAT I THINK ABOUT A THIS IS A HEAP MAP DIAGRAM OF SUBJECTIVE REPORTS THAT PEOPLE GAVE OF WHERE THEY EXPERIENCE A AN EMOTION OR A FEELING A SOMATIC FEELING IN THEIR BODY OR IN THEIR HEAD WERE BOTH WHEN THEY ARE ANGRY SAD CALM LONELY ET CETERA ET CETERA AND I WOULDN'T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK THAT THOSE HEAP MAPS WERE GENERATED BY ANY PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT AND YET I DON'T THINK WE CAN HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT EMOTIONS AND STATES AND THE SORTS OF BEHAVIORS THAT WERE TALKING OUT TO DAY WITHOUT THING ABOUT THE BODY ALSO AND I'M NOT COMING TO THIS AS A NORTHERN CALIFORNIA MIND BODY A BEEN ECELLEN ONCE I DIDN'T GO IN THE BATHS I WENT THERE I GIVE A TALK AND I LAUGHED IT IS VERY BEAUTIFUL AM IF ANYONE WANTS TO N WHA IT LOOKS LIKE I THINK THAT FINAL SCENE OF MADMEN IS SHOT AT ESELAN A THE VERY BEAUTIFUL PLACE AND YET MINE BODY IS A NTO ME AS A NEROBIOLOGICAL CONSTRUCT BECAUSE THE NERVOUS SYSTEM EXTENDS THROUGH THE OUT OF THE CRANIAL VAULTAND INTO THE FINAL PORT IND BODY AND BACKAND FORTH OK HOW SHALL WE THINK ABOUT THE BODY AND IN TERMS OF STATES AND AT SOME POINT I LOF YOU TO COMMENT ON THAT HEAT MAP EXPERIMENT BECAUSE IT DOES SEEM THAT THERE SOME REGULARITY AS TO WERE PEOPLE EXPERIENCE EMOTIONS WHEN PEOPLE ARE IN A RAGE FOR INSTANCE THEY SEEM TO FEEL IT BOTH IN THEIR GUT AND IN THEIR HEAD IT SEEMS ON AVERAGE AND PEOPLE LOVE TO EXTRAPLATE TO GOT INTUITION AND NOR THAT THE YOU KNOW THE CHACRAS OR ANGER IS IN THE STOMAC AND A DISGOES TO EASTERN MEDICINE ET CETERA HOW SHALL WE THINK ABOUT MINE BODY IN THE CONTECTS OF STATES AND THINK ABOUT IT A SCIENTISTS MAY BE VEN AS NO SCIENTISTS URGEON ETISIS GOOD A SO FOR THE ANSWER THE FIRST QUESTION ABOUT THE HEAT MAPS AND PEOPLE ASSOCIATING CERTAIN PARTS THEIR BODY WITH CERTAIN EMOTIONAL FEELINGS A THIS GOES BACK TO A SOMETHING CALLED THE SOMATIC MARKER HYPOTHESIS THAT WAS PROPOSE BY ANTONIO DEMAUSIO WHO IS A NEUROLOGIST THAT A USE THE THE IDEA THAT ARE SUBJECTIVE FEELING OF A PARTICULAR EMOTION IS IN PART ASSOCIATED WITH A SENSATION OF SOMETHING HAPPENING IN A PARTICULAR PART OF OUR BODY THE GUT HEART I DON'T SEE THE LIVER INVOKED VERY MUCH INA IN IN EMOTIONAL A CHARACTERIZATION BUT A GAL AND THE GALL YAS SOMEBODY HAVING A LOT AT GO O NOWHYI I MAKE A FIST WHEN I SAY THAT BUT AVE NISSING TA GALL BLATDER SHAPE LIKE A FIST A AND AND YOU KNOW IF THERE IS A PHYSIOLOGY UNDERLYING THESE HEAT MAPS IT COULD RETLECT INCREASE BLOOD FLOW TO THESE DIFFERENT STRUCTURES AND THAT IN TURN REFLECTS WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT IS EMOTION IS DEFINITELY INVOLVES COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE BRAIN AND THE BODY AND ITS BY DIRECTIONAL COMMUNICATION AND ITS MEDIATED BY THE PRIFERAL NERVOU SYSTEM THE SYMPATHETIC AND THE PARIS SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM WHICH CONTROL PART RATE FOR EXAMPLE BLOOD VESSEL BLOOD PRESSURE A AND THOSE NERONS RECEIVE IN PUT FROM THE HYPOTHALYMOUS AND OTHER BLOOD A BRAIN REGION CENTRAL BRAIN REGIONS THE CONTROL THEIR ACTIVITY AND WHEND THE BRAIN IS PUT IN A PARTICULAR STATE IT ACTIVATES SYMPATHETIC AND P OUR SYMPATHETIC NERANTS WHICH HAVE EFFECTS ON THE HEART AND ON BLOOD PRESSURE AND THESE IN TURN FEED BACK ON TO THE BRAIN THROUGH THE SENSORY SYSTEM AND A LARGE PART OF THIS BYDIRECTIONAL COMMUNICATION IS ALSO MEDIATED THROUGH THE VAGUEST NERVE WHICH A MANY OF YOUR A A LISTENERS AND VIEWERS MAY HAVE HEARD ABOUT BECAUSE IT BECOME A TOPICOF INTENSE ACTIVITY NOW PEOPLE OF KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME TH SO THE VAGUEST NERVE IS A A BUNDLE OF NERVE FIBRES THAT COMES OUT ASICALLY OF YOUR SKULL OUT OF THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THEN SENDS FIBRES IN TO YOUR HEART YOUR GOT ALL SORTS OF THICERAL ORGANS SO WHEN YOU HAVE US AND THAT INFORMATION IS BOTH USED THE WORDS EARLIER IN OUR DISCUSSION AFFERENT AND EFFERENT SO THE THE VAGAL FIBRES SENSE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN THE BODY SO WHEN YOUR THE REASON YOU FEEL YOUR STOMACH HIDE UP IN NOTS IF YOUR TENS IS THAT THOSE VAGAL FIBRS ARE SENSING THE CONTRACTION OF THE GUT MUSCLES AND THERE ALSO AFFERENCE WHICH MEANS THAT INFORMATION COMING OUT OF THE BRAIN CAN INFLUENTS THOSE PERIFERAL ORGANS AS WELL AND THERE'S WORK FROM A NUMBER OF LABS JUST IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS OR SO WHERE PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO DEEP HODE THE COMPONENTS OF THE DIFFERENT FIBRES IN THE VAGUEST NERVE AND ITS AMAZING HOW MUCH SPECIFICITY IS THERE ARE SPECIFIC VAGAL NERVES THAT GO TO THE LUNG THAT CONTROL BREATHING RESPONCES THAT GO TO THE GOT THAT GO TO OTHER ORGANS  ITS ALMOST LIKE A SET OF COLOUR COTED LINES A LABELE LINES FOR THOSE THINGS AND NOW HOW THOSE VAGAL AFFERENCE CLAY AROLL IN THE PLAYING OUT OF EMOTION STATES IS A FASCINATING QUESTION THAT PEOPLE ARE JUST BEGINNING TO SCRAPE THE SURFACE OF BUT I THINK WHAT'S EXCITING NOW IS THAT PEOPLE ARE CONOBE DEVELOPING TOOLS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO TURN ON ARE TURN OFF SPECIFIC SUBSETS OF FIBRES WITH IN THE VAGUEST NERVE AND ASK HOW THAT AFFECTS PARTICULAR EMOTIONAL BEHAVIOURS SO YOUR ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THIS BRAIN BODY CONNECTION IS CRITICAL NOJIOUS FOR THE GUT BUT FOR THE HEART FOR THE LUNGS FOR ALL KINDS OF OTHER A PARTS OF YOUR BODY AND DARWIN RECOGNIZE THAT AS WELL AND I THINK IT'S A IT ITS A CENTRAL FEATURE OF EMOTION STATE AND I THINK WHAT UNDERLIES ARE SUBJECTIVE FEELINGS OF AN EMOTION CREDIBLE DAVID I TO SAY AS A TRUE PHEAN OF THE WORK THAT YOUR LAB HAS BEEN DOING OVER SO MANY DECADES AND AM FIRST WHILE I WAS DELIGHTED WHEN YOU STOPPED WORKING ONSTEMSELVES NOT CAUSE YOU WEREN'T DOING INCREDIBLE WORK THERE BUT BECAUSE I SAW A TALK WHERE YOU SHOWED A A MOVY OF ANOCTOPUS AM SPITTING OUT ORE NOT SPITTING BUT A SCORTING OUT A BUNCH OF INK AND ESCAPING AND YOU SAID YOU 'RE GIN TO WORK ON THINGS OF THE SORT THEYWERE TALKING ABOUT TO DAY FEAR AGGRESSION MADING BEHAVIOURS SOCIAL BEHAVIORS A IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLE TO SEE THE WORK THAT YOUR LAB IS DONE AND I KNOW I SPEAK ON BEHALF A TERMIN OF I KNOW I SPEAK ON BEHALF OF A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF PEOPLE WEN I IS A THANK YOU FOR TAKING TIME OUT OF YOUR IMPORTANT SCHADUAL TO SHARE WITH US WHAT YOU'VE LEARNED MY LAST QUESTION AS IS A SIMPLE ONE WHICH IS A WILL YOU COME BACK AND TALK TO US AGAIN IN THE FUTURE ABOUT THE ADDITIONAL WORK THAT'S SURE TO COME I WOULD BE HAPPY TO DO THAT AND I REALLY HAVE APPRECIATED YOUR QUESTIONS THEYARE ALL THEY'VE ALL BEEN RIGHT ON THE MONEY YOU'VE HIT ALL THE CRITICAL IMPORTANT ISSUES IN THIS FIELD AND YOU'VE YOU'VE UNCOVERED WHAT IS KNOWN THE LITTLE BITT IS KNOWN AND HOW MUCH IS NOT KNOWN AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THE UNKNOWN THINGS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE NEXT GENERATION OF NEURVOU SCIENTIST HAS TO SOLVE AND SO I HOPE THIS WILL HELP TO ATTRACT YOUNG PEOPLE INTO THIS FIELD PBECAUSE IT'S SO IMPORTANT PARTICULARLY FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING OF MENTAL ILLNESS

WELCOME TO THE HUBERMANSCIENCESCIENCE PACETO RI MAY DREW HUBERMEN AND ON OR PROFESSOR OF NERBIOLOGY AND OPTHOMOLOGY AT STAMPORD SCHOOL OF MEDICINE TO DAY WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS THE USE OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE FOR HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE TEMPERATURE IS A POWERFUL STIMULUS ON OUR NERVOUS SYSTEM AND INDEED ON EVERY ORGAN AND SYSTEM OF OUR BODY AND COLD IN PARTICULAR CAN BE LEVERAGE TO IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE MEANING FOR ENDURANCE EXERCISE FOR RECOVERING FROM VARIOUS FORMS OF EXERCISE FOR ACTUALLY IMPROVING STRENGTH AND POWER AND FOR ENHANCING MENTAL CAPACITY IN ORDER TO PROPERLY LEVERAGE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE FOR SAKE OF MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE Y EFT UNDERSTAND HOW COLD INPACTS THE BRAIN AND BODY SO TODAY WE ARE GOING TO DISCUSS THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE NERAL CIRCUITS AND PATHWAYS SOME OF THE HORMONES INVOLTH I PROMISE TO MAKE IT ALL CLEAR AND ACCESSIBLE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT YOU HAVE A SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND OR NOT WE ARE ALSO GOING TO DISCUSS A VERY SPECIFIC PROTOCOLS THAT YOU CAN APPLY WHICH LEVERAGE VARIABLES LIKE TEMPERATURE HOW COLD HOW TO DELIVER THE COLD FOR INSTANCE WHETHER NOT USE A COLD SHOWER COLD IMMERSION ICE BATH CIRCULATING WATER OR STILL WATER WHETHER NOT YOUR GOING FOR WALKS OUTSIDE IN A TEACHER WHEN ITS COLD OR WHETHER OR NOT YOUR PURPOSEULY USING THINGS LIKE CRIO IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THAT OR NOT ONE THING I CAN PROMISE YOU IS THAT BY THE END OF TO DAY'S EPISODE YOU WILL KNOW A LOT ABOUT THE BIOLOGY OF THERMAL REGULATION THAT IS HOW YOUR BRAIN IN BODY REGULATES ITS TEMPERATURE YOU WILL ALSO HAVE A LOT OF TOOLS IN YOUR ARSONAL THAT YOU CAN USE AND LEVERAGE TOWARD IMPROVING MENTAL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH REDUCING IMFLAMMATION IN THE BODY IMPROVING ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE IMPROVING MENTAL PERFORMANCE I PROMISE TO SPEL OUT ALL THOSE PROTOCOLS IN DETAIL AS I GO ALONG AND TO SUMMARIZE THEM AGAIN AT THE END ID LIKE TO MAKE A POINT NOW THAT I AM GOING TO MAKE SEVERAL ADDITIONAL TIMES DURING TO DAY'S EPISODE AND THAT IS THAT TEMPERATURE IS A VERY POTENT STIMULUS FOR THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT ALSO MEANS THAT IT CARRIES CERTAIN HAZARDS IF IT'S NOT DONE CORRECTLY NOW EVERY ONE SHOWS UP TO THE TABLE MEANING TO PROTOCOLS WITH A DIFFERENT BACKGROUND OF HEALTH STATUS AND THERE SIMPLY NO WAY THAT I CAN KNOW WHAT YOUR HEALTH STATUS IS SO ANY TIME YOU ARE GOING TO TAKE ON A NEW PROTOCOL THAT MEANS A BEHAVIORAL PROTOCOL OR NUTRITIONAL PROTOCOL OR SUPPLEMENTATION PROTOCL YOU SHOULD ABSOLUTELY CONSULT ABOARD CERTIFIED PHYSICIAN BEFORE INITIATING THAT PROTOCOL I DON'T YOU SAY THIS TO PROTECT US I ALSO SAY THIS TO PROTECT YOU IF YOU'D LIKE TO SEE OURE MEDICAL DISCLAIMER YOU CAN GO TO OUR SHOW NOTES ITS DESCRIBE THERE IN FACT I ENCOURAGE YOU TO PLEASE DO THAT AND IN GENERAL WHEN EMBARKING ON NEW PROTOCOLS IN PARTICULAR IF THEY INVOLVE STRONG STIMULE LIKE CHANGING TEMPERATURE RPLACING YOURSELF INTO UNUSUAL TEMPERATURES I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO PROGRESS GRADUALLY I WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE YOU TO NOT LOOK AT GRADUAL PRO GRESSION AS THE KIND OF WEAK VERSION OF O PROTOCOL IN FACT TODAY I'M GOING TO DISCUSS A REALLY BEAUTIFUL PIRREVIEWED STUDY THAT INVOLVED HAVING PEOPLE DO DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE SO THEY WERE IMMERSING THEMSELVES INTO WATER UP TO ABOUT THEIR NECK AND THE WATER WAS ACTULLY NOT THAT COLD IT WAS ONLY ABOUT SIXTY DEGREES FARENEIHT WHICH FOR MOST PEOPLE IS PRETTY TOLERABLE SO NOWHERE NEAR THE KINDS OF EXTREME TEMPERATURES THAT ONE COULD USE IN OTHER PROTOCOLS AND THE INTERESTING THING IS DESPITE THAT FAIRLY MODEST COLD TEMPERATURE BY SIMPLY EXTENDING THE DURATION OF TIME THAT PEOPLE WERE IN THAT WATER THEY EXPERIENCE ENORMOUS INCREASES IN NEUROCHEMICALS THAT OUGHT TO TRANSLATE TO IMPROVEMENTS IN FOCUS AND MOOD AND INDEED THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN OBSERVED IN SUBSEQUENT STUDIES SO AGAIN PLEA SEE OUR MEDICAL DISCLAIMER IN OUR SHOW NOTES PLEASE PROCEED WITH CAUTION ALWAYS PLEASE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THE MOST POTENT STIMULUS ISN'T ALWAYS THE ONE THAT YOU EXPERIENCE AS THE MOST INTENSE IN THE MOMENT IN FACT I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO FIND THE MINIMUM THRESHOL OF STIMULUS THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO DERIVE THE MAXIMUM BENEFIT FROM EACH PROTOCOL AND INDEED I WILL POINT OUT WHAT THOSE THRESHOLDS OUGHT TO BE TODAY I'LL IV YOU SOME SIMPLE FORMULAS A GAUGES OR GUIDES THAT YOU CAN USE IN ORDER TO NAVIGATE THIS EXTREMELY INTERESTING AND POTENT TOOL THAT WE CALL DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE AND ITS MANY POWERFUL APPLICATIONS I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT A STUDY THAT I FIND PARTICULARLY INTERESTING THAT I THINK YOU WILL FIND PARTICULARLY INTERESTING AN USEFUL THE TITLE OF THIS STUDY IS BRIEF EROVIC EXERCISE IMMEDIATELY ENHANCES VISUAL ATTENTIONAL CONTROL AND PERCEPTIAL SPEED TESTING THE MEDIATING ROL OF FEELINGS OF ENERGY NOW THE REASON I LIKE THIS STUDY IS FIRST OF ALL IT'S A FAIRLY LARGE SIZED SAMPLE GROUP THEY LOOKD AT A HUNDRED IN ONE STUDENTS THESE WERE COLLOGATED STUDENTS AND THEY HAD TWO GROUPS ONE GROUP DID FIFTEEN MINUTES OF JOGGING AT MODERATE INTENSITY SO AND THEY DID MEASURE PERCENT HEARTRATES ET CETERA BUT THIS WOULD BE ANALOGOUS TO ZONE TO CARDIO WHICH IAVE DISCUSSED ON THIS PODCAST BEFORE ZONE TO CARDIO IS CARDIOVASCULAR EXERCISE THAT PLACES YOU AT A LEVEL WHERE YOU CAN HOLD THE CONVERSATION WITH A LITTLE BIT OF STRAIN MEANING THAT YOU CAN GET THE WORDS OUT BUT EVERY ONE'S WHILE YOU HAVE TO CAPT YOUR BREATH WHEREAS IF YOU WERE TO PUSH ANY HARDER BY ANY MECHANISM GOING FASTER OR ON A STEEPER INCLINE ET CETERA THAT YOU WOULD HAVE A HARD TIME CARRYING OUT A CONVERSATION SO ZONE TO CARDIO IS IA COMMON FORM OF DESCRIBING THAT LEVEL OF INTENSITY THAT THEY CALL MODERATE INTENSITY SO ONE GROUP DID FIFTEEN MINUTES OF JOGGING AT MODERATE INTENSITY WHICH I'M TRANSLATING TO ROUGHLY ZONE TO CARDIO THE OTHER GROUP DID FIFTEEN MINUTES OF RELAXATION CONCENTRATION THAT IS SOMEWHAT AKIN TO MINDFULNESS MEDITATION AND THEN THEY WERE ANALYZED FOR PERCEPTINAL SPEED VISUAL ATTENTIONAL CONTRO OL SOMETHING CALLED WORKING MEMORY WHICH IS YOUR ABILITY TO KEEP CERTAIN A BATCHES OF INFORMATION ON LINE I JUST IMAGINE A SOME ONE TELLING YOU THEIR PONE NUMBER AND YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT SEQUENCE OF NUMBERS IN YOUR IN YOUR HEAD OW FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME THAT'S WORKING MEMORY AND IT DEPENDS VERY HEAVILY ON THE SO CALLED PREFRONTAL CORTICAL NETWORKS A WHICH RINVOLVED IN PLANNING IN ACTION AND THEY ALSO LOOKED AT PEOPLE'S FEELINGS OF ENERGY AND THEY MEASURE THAT SUBJECTIVELY HOW ENERGETIC PEOPLE FELT NOW THE MAJOR TAKE AWAYS FROM THE STUDY THAT I LIKE TO EMPHASIZE ARE THAT THE FIFTEEN MINUTES OF JOGGING GROUP EXPERIENCE ELEVATED LEVELS OF ENERGY FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME AFTER THEY CEASE THE EXERCISE WHEREAS THE GROUP THAT DID MINDFULNESS MEDITATION ACTUALLY REPORTED FEELING MORE CALM AND HAVING LESS OVER ALL ENERGY NOW THAT'S VERY SUBJECTIVE IN INDEED THEY USE SUBJECT MEASURES TO A ANALYZED ENERGY BUT WHAT GETS INTERESTING IS WHEN THEY LOOKED AT PERFORMANCE ON THESE VARIOUS COGNATIVE TASKS AND THE TWO TASKS THAT THEY USE WERE CALLED THE TRAIL MAKING TESTS THEY HAVE DIFFERENTVERSION TO THIS VERSIONA VERSION B I DON'T WANT TO GO IN TO TOO MUCH DETAIL BUT VIRGION A ESSENTIALLY INVOLVES HAVING A PAGE OF NUMBERS THAT ARE DISTRIBUTED SOMEWHAT RANDOMLY SO ONE TO THEFORFIVES IC EVENTY AND AND SO ON BUT DISTRIBUTED RANDOMLY ACROSS THE PAGE AND PEOPLE HAVE TO USE VISUAL SEARCH TO CIRCLE THOSE NUMBERS IN SEQUENCE SO THIS INVOLVES AS YUALL ATTENTION IN INVOLVE SOME MOTOR SKILLS WILVES THE NUMBER OF THINGS THAT CERTAINLY REQUIRE ENERGY AND FOCUS THE SECOND TEST WAS THE TRAIL MAKING TEST PART BE AS A MENSION EARLIER AND THIS INVOLVED ALSO CIRCLING NUMBERS AND SEQUENCE BUT INTERSPERSE BETWEEN THOSE NUMBERS WERE LETTERS SO RATHER THAN JUST HAVING TO CIRCLE OFF NUMBERS AND SEQUENCE THEY ACTUALLY HAD TO CONNECT ONE THEN THE LETTER A THAN TWO THAN THE LETTER BE ET CETERA AN REMEMBER THESE A RANDOMLY DISTRIBUTED ACROSS TA PAGE THE MAJOR TAKE AWAY FROM THE STUDY IS THAT THE GROUP THAT DID THE FIFTEEN MINUTES OF MODERATE EXERCISE PRIOR TO THESE TWO TESTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN THE AMOUNT OF TIME REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THESE TESTS ACCURATELY THAT IS INTERESTING EN INDED SURPRISING AT LEASE TO ME BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN MANY STUDIES LOOKING AT THE EFFECTS OF MINDFULNESS MEDITATION ON THE ABILITY TO FOCUS THE KEY VARIABLE IN THE STUDY TURNED OUT TO BE ENERGY THIS FEELING SUBJECTIVELY MEASURED FEELING I SHOULD SAY OF HAVING MORE ENERGY AND THEREBY THE ABILITY TO FOCUS ESPECIALLY IN THESE HIGH COGNITIVE DEMAND TASK NOW THET TAKE AWAY FROM THE STUDY FOR ALL OF US I THINK IS PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD IF YOU ARE GOING TO SIT DOWN TO DO SOME WORK THAT REQUIRES FOCUS AND WORKING MEMORY AND COGNIVATTENTION AND ESPECIALLY FISOME BTVISUAL SPACIAL CONTROL MEANING YOU HAVE TO CEARCH FOR THNGS ON A PAGE YOU HAVE TO ORGANIZE THINGS ON A PAGE SO THIS WO BE WRITING ARITHMETIC BASICALLY COGNTIVE WORK OF ANY KIND FIFTEEN MINUTES OFE MODERATE EXERCISE DONE PRIOR TO THAT WORKABOUT COULD BE VERY BENEFICIAL FOR YOU THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT MINDFULNESS MEDITATION WOULD NOT BE OF BENEFIT TO YOU I WOULDN'T WANT YOU TO CONCLUDE THAT BUT IF YOU HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN DOING FIFTEEN MINUTES OF MINDFUL NESS MEDITATION AND DOING FIFTEEN MINUTES A MODERATE EXERCISE PRIOR TO A COGNITIVE WORKBOUT I WOULD SAY THE FIFTEEN MINTES OF MODERATE EXERCISE WOULD BE MORE VALUABLE AT LEAST BASED ON THE DATA IN THIS PAPER IN MANY PREVIOUS PODCASTS I'VE TALKED ABOUT THE POWERFUL EFFECTS OF DOING THINGS LIKE MINDFULNESS MEDITATION IND OTHER FORMS OF AN STIR NON SLEEP DEEP RESS TO THESE CAN BE TWENTY MENUTE NAPS OR JUST LYING THERE QUIETLY WITH YOUR EYES CLOSED OR YOGONEDRA OR N STIAR SCRIPTS ARE AVAILABLE ON YOU TWOBE IN VARIOUS OTHER PLACES FREE OF COST OF ANY KIND YOU JUST GO TO YOU TO PUT IN AND S TIAR NON SLEEP DEE BREAST THOSE PROTOCALLS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE VERY BENEFICIAL FOR ENHANCING NEURAL PLASTICITY THE CHANGES IN THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT IN CODE OR SHIFT THE NERAL CIRCUITS THAT ALLOW FOR MEMORY TO CHANGE THAT ALLOW FOR LEARNING TO A CUR AFTER A LEARNING BOUT WHAT 'M REFERRING TO TO DAY AND THIS PARTICULAR STUDY IS THE USE OF MODERATE EXERCISE IN ORDER TO INCREASE ONE FOCUS AND ATTENTION IN ORDER TO TRIGGER THAT NERL PLASTICITY SO THE SIMPLE SEQUENCE HERE IS YET ENERGETIC AND ALERT DO THAT PRIOR TO TE LEARNING BOUT ENGAGE IN THE COGNAIVE WORK OR LEARNING BOUT AND THEN MINDFULNESS MEDITATION AND S TIAR AND SO FORTH SHOULD FOLLOW AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ACCESS THIS PAPER AND LIKE TO LOOK MORE AT THE DETAILS IN THE PAPER I WILL BE SURE TO PUT A LINC IN THE SHONOTES THE FIRST AUTHOR IS LEGRAND AND AGAIN THE TITLE OF THIS PAPER IS BRIEF EROBIC EXERCISE IMMEDIATELY ENHANCE AS VISUAL ATTENTUAL CONTROL AND PERCEPTIAL SPEED TESTING THE MEDIATING ROLL OF FEELINGS OF ENERGY AND I ALSO JUST WONE TO EMPHASISE IMMEDIATELY I THINK MOST PEOPLE OUT THERE ARE INTERESTED IN TOOLS AND PROTOCOLS THAT WORK THE FIRST TIME IN THAT WORK EVERY TIME AND INDEED I THINK THIS PROTOCOLL FITZ THAT BILL BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASISE THAT THIS PODCAST IS SEPARATE FROR MY TEACHING IN RESEARCH ROLLS STAMFORD IT IS HOWEVER PART OF MY DESIRE N EFFORT TO BRING ZEROCOST TO CONSUMER INFORMATION ABOUT SCIENCE AND SCIENCE RELATED TOOLS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN KEEPING WITH THAT THEME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE SPONSORS OF TO DAY'S PODCAST OUR FIRST SPONSER IS ATHLETIC GREENS ATHLETIC GREENS IS AN ALL IN ONE VITEMEN MINERAL PROBIOTIC DRINK I'VE BEEN TAKING ATHLETIC GREENS SINCE TWO THOUSAND

ALSO BROUGHT TO US BY ELEMENT ELEMENTS IS AN ELECTROLIKE DRINK THAT HAS EVERYTHING YOU NEED AND NOTHING YOU DON'T THAT MEANS THE EXACT RATIOES OF ELECTROLYTES ARE AN ELEMENT AND THOSE ARE SODIUM MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM BUT IT HAS NO SUGAR OF TALK MANY TIMES BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST ABOUT THE KEY ROLL OF HYDRATION AND ELECTROLYTES FOR NERVE SELL FUNCTION NURON FUNCTION AS WELL AS THE FUNCTION OF ALL THE CELLS AND ALL THE TISSUES IN ORGAN SYSTEMS OF THE BODY IF WE HAVE SODIU MAGNESIUM AND POTASSIUM PRESENT IN THE PROPARATIOES ALL OF THOSE CELLS FUNCTION PROPERLY AND ALL OUR BODILY SYSTEMS CAN BE OPTIMIZED IF THE ELECTROLYTES ARE NOT PRESENT AND IF HYDRATION IS LOW WE SIMPLY CAN'T THINK AS WELL AS WE WOULD OTHERWISE AOUR MOOD IS OFF HORMONE SYSTEMS GO OFF OUR ABILITY TO GET INTO PHYSICAL ACTION TO ENGAGE IN ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS IS DIMINISHED SO WITH ELEMENT YOU CAN MAKE SURE THAT YOUR STAYING ON TOP OF YOUR HYDRATION AND THAT YOURE GETTING THE

DELICIOUS SO AGAIN IF YOU WANT A TRY ELEMENT YOU CAN GO TO ELEMENT ELEMENTY DO CAM SLASH HUBERMEN O CA LET'S TALK ABOUT THE USE OF COLD FOR HEALTH AND PERFORMENTE I CONFESS I LOVE THIS TOPIC BECAUSE IT TAKES ME BACK TO MY UNDERGRADUATE YEARS WHEN I WORKED IN ELABORATORY STUDYING COLD PHYSIOLOGY ITS EFFECTS ON THE BRAIN AND ITS EFFECTS ON THE BODY AND OVER THE YEARS I'VE ALWAYS KEPT TRACK OF THE LITERATURE IN THIS AREA AND INDEED THERE VE BEEN SOME TREMENDOUS DISCOVERIES BOTH IN ANIMAL MODELS SWHEN RODINS LIKE MICE AND RATS BUT ALSO IN HUMANS AND TO DAY WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT BOTH CATEGORIES OF STUDIES AND I WILL BE CAREFUL TO POINT OUT WHEN DISCOVERIES WERE MADE IN ANIMAL MODELS AND WHEN THEY WERE MADE IN HUMANS A KEY POINT WHEN THINKING ABOUT THE USE OF COLD AS A TOOL AND THE KEY POINT IS THAT YOU HAVE A BASELINE LEVEL OF TEMPERATURE THAT IS VARYING CHANGING ACROSS THE TWENTY FOR OUR CYCLE SO ANY USE OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE IS GOING TO BE SUPERIMPOSED ON THAT RHYTHM THAT CIRCADIAN RHYTHM MEANING THAT TWENTY FOR OUR RHYTHM THE BASIC CONTOUR OF YOUR CIRCADIAN RHYTHM IN TEMPERATURE IS THAT APPROXIMATELY TWO HOURS BEFORE THE TIME YOU WAKE UP IS YOUR SO CALLED TEMPERATURE MINIMUM SYOU TEMPERATURE MINIMUM IS A TIME WITHIN THE TWENTY FOR HOUR CYCLE WHEN YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE IS AT ITS LOWEST SO IF YOU NORMALLY WAKE UP AROUN ND  SUX A M YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM IS PROBABLY ABOUT FOR A M IF YOU NORMALLY WAKE UP AND ABOUT SEVEN A M YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM IS PROBABLY ABOUT FIVE A M IT'S NOT EXACTLY TWO HOURS BEFORE YOUR WAKE UP TIME IT'S APPROXIMATELY TO OURS BEFORE YOUR WAKE UP TIME NOW AS YOU GO FROM YOUR TEMPERATURE MINIMUM TO THE TIME IN WHICH YOU ARE GOING TO AWAKE YOUR TEMPERATURE IS RISING SLIGHTLY AND THEN AT THE POINT WHERE YOU WAKE UP YOUR TEMPERATURE STARTS TO GO UP MORE SHARPLY AND WILL CONTINUE TO GO UP INTO THE EARLY AND SOMETIMES EVEN INTO THE LATE AFTERNOON AND THEN SOMETIME IN THE LATE AFTERNOON AND EVENING YOUR TEMPERATURE WILL START TO DECLINE AND INDEED AS YOU APPROACH SLEEP YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE WILL DROP BY ANYWHERE FROM ONE TO THREE DEGREES AND IN FACT THAT DECREASE IN COR BODY TEMPERATURE IS IMPORTANT IF NOT ESSENTIAL FOR GETTING INTO AND STAYING IN DEEP SLEEP SO TEMPERATURE RISES WITH WAKING THAT'S EASY TO REMEMBER IT TENDS TO CONTINU RISE THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND IN THE LATE AFTERNOON AN EVENING YOUR TEMPERTURE WILL START TO GO DOWN AND THE DROP AN TEMPERATURE ACTUALLY HELPS YOU ACESS SLEEP THAT BACKROUND OR WHAT WE CALL BASE LINE CRCADIAN RHYTHM IN COR BODY TEMPERATURE IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER BECAUSE IT HELPS US FRAME BOTH THE EFFECTS OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE AND T HELPS US FRAME WHEN YOU MIGHT WANT TO USE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE IN ORDER TO AES SPECIFIC STATES IT ALSO POINTS TO  TIMES WITHIN THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR CYCLE WHEN YOU MIGHT WANT TO AVOID USING DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE IF YOUR PRIMARY GOAL IS TO GET TO SLEEP OC O THAT'S THE CIRCADTIAN RHYTHM IN TEMPERATURE NOW I JUST BRIEFLY WANT A TOUCH ON THERMAL REGULATION AT THE LEVEL OF THE BODY AND THE BRAIN AND THIS WILL BE VERY SURPRISING TO MANY OF YOU LET'S DO WHAT'S CALL THE GODONKAN EXPERIMENT WHICH IS A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT LET'S SAY I SEND YOU OUT INTO THE DESERT HEAT FOR A JOG OR A RUN AND IT'S VERY HOT OUTSIDE YOU KNOW A HUNDRED AND TWO DEGREES OR A HUNDRED AND THREE DEGREES AND YOU START TO MOVE YOU START TO SWEAT AND OF COURSE YOUR CORBODY TEMPERATURE GOES UP NOW THEN I OFFER YOU A COLD TOWEL MAY BE A REALLY REALLY COL TOWEL AND THIS TOWEL ISSATURATED WITH WATERS YOU COULD ACTUALLY SQUEEZE THE WATER OUT OF THAT EN COOL YOUR BODY OFF AND OUR GODONKAN EXPERIMENT IS FOR ME TO SAY O KA WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO PLACE THE TOWEL HOW ARE YOU GOING TO COOL YOURSELF OFF AND I'M GUSSING THAT MOST OF YU WOULD THINK THAT THE BEST WAY TO COOL YOURSELF OFF WOULD BE TO DRAPE THAT TOWEL OVER YOUR HEAD MAY BE YOUR NECK OVER YOUR TOR SO THAT IT IF YOUEL REALLY REALLY GOOD AND THEY WIULD COOL YOU OFF WELL THAT'S EXACTLY THE WRONG APPROACH IF YOU WANT A COOL OFF AND IN FACT IF YOU WERE TO USE THAT APPROACH YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE WOULD CONTINUE TO INCREASE EVEN MORE YES EVEN MORE THAN HAD YOU NOT PLACED THAT COLD TOWEL ON YOUR HEAD OR YOUR T ORSO AND HERE IS WHY THERMAL REGULATION MEANING YOUR BRAIN AND BODY'S ABILITY TO REGULATE YOUR INTERNAL COR TEMPERATURE IS SOMEWHAT LIKE A THERMISTAT AND THAT THERMISTAT RESIDES IN YOUR BRAIN SO IF YOU THING BY THE THERMISTAT IN YOUR HOME OR APARTMENT IF IT'S TOO WARM IN YOUR HOME OR APARTMENT AND YOU WERE TO TAKE A BAG OF ICE AND TO PUT IT ON THAT THERMISTAT WHAT WOITH THE THERMISTAT DO IT WOULD REGISTER THE ENVIRONMENT AS ARTIFICUALLY COOL RIGHT IT WOULD THINK THAT THE ENVIRONMENT WAS ACTUALLY MUCH COLDER THAN IT IS AND SO AS A CONSEQUENCE IT WOULD TRIGGER A MECHANISM TO FURTHER INCREASE THE TEMPERATURE IN THE ROOM AND YOU HAVE SUCH A THERMISTAT AS WELL IT'S CALLED THE MEDIAL PREOPTIC AREA OF THE HYPOTHALEMUS THE HYPOTHALMUS IS A SMALL REGION OF BRAIN TISSUE ABOUT OVER THE ROOF OF YOUR MOUTH AND LITLE BIT IN FRONT OF THAT SO IT'S A BASICALLY RIGHT BEHIND YOUR NOSE AND OVER THE ROOF FOR YOUR MOUTH AND IT'S A COLLECTION OF NURONS THOSE NURONS HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS THAT INCLUDE THINGS LIKE ON THE CONTROL OF A GRESSION THE CONTROL OF SEX BEHAVIOR OF THE CONTROL OF TEMPERATURE REGULATION AND SO ON THE MEDIAL PREOPTIC ARIA HAS CONNECTIONS WITH THE REST OF THE BRAIN OR AREAS WITHIN THE BRAIN I SHOULD SAY AND WITH MANY AREAS WITHIN THE BODY IT RECEIVES INPUT FROM RECEPTERS IN OUR SKIN AND INSIDE OUR BODY THAT REGISTER TEMPERATURE AND IT ACTS AS A THERMSTAT SO IF THE SURFACE OF YOUR BODY IS MADE COOL YOUR MEDIAL PREOPTIC AREA WILL SEND SIGNALS BY WAY OF HORMONS AND BY WAY OF CHEMICALS THAT WILL SERVE TO HEAT YOUR BODY UP SO WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT IF YOU WANT A COOL DOWN THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS TO BRING A COLD SURFACE OF ANY KIND TOWEL OR SPLASHING WATER TO THE MAJORITY OF YOUR BODY SURFACE I MIGHT BE VERY VERY SURPRISINGTO YOU AND YOU MIGHT SAY WEIGHT IF I WANT T COOL DOWN I SHOULD JUMP INTO A COLD LAKE OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT THAT'S A DIFFERENT THING ALTOGETHER WHAT I'LL TELL YOU AND WE'LL GET INTO THIS IN MORE DEPTH LATER IS THAT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO COOL DOWN QUICKLY IN EFFISCIENTLY YOU SHOULD LEVERAGE PARTICULAR PORTALS MEANING PARTICULAR SITES ON YOUR BODY WHERE HEAT CAN LEAVE YOUR BODY MORE READILY AND WHERE COOLING CAN HAVE A DRAMATIC AND FAST IMPACT ON YOUR CORBODY TEMPERATURE CAN EVEN SAVE YOUR LIFE IF YOU'RE GOING HYPEROTHERMIC ORGANATAC MORE ABOUT THE SPECIFIC PROTOCALS TO REDUCE CORBODY TEMPERATURE FOR SAKE OF PERFORMANCE AND AVOIDING HYPROTHERMIA LATER IN THE EPISODE HYPROTHERMY OF COURSE IS A VERY VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION BECAUSE WHILE YOUR BODY CAN DROP IN COR TEMPERATURE SOMEWHAT AND STILL BE SAFE YOU CAN'T REALLY INCREASE YOUR BODY TEMPRATURE THAT MUCH BEFORE YOUR BRAIN STARTS TO COOK ANOTHER ORGAN START TO COOK AN BY COOK I MEAN THE SELLS ACTUALLY START TO DIE SO YOU HAVE TO BE VERY VERY CAREFUL WITH THE USE OF HEAT HEAT STROKE IS NO JOKE PEOPLE DIE FROM HEAT STROKE ALL THETIME YOU REALLY WANT TO AVOID THAT ONE WAY TO AVOID THAT IS TO COOL THE APPROPRIATE SURFACES OF YOUR BODY AND THE APPROPRIATE SURFACES IN THIS CACE ARE THE UPPER CHEEKS OR THA I WOULD SAY THE UPPER HALF OF THE FACE THE PALMS OF YOUR HANDS IN THE BOTTOMS OF YOUR FEET IAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS ON THE PODCASTS BEFORE AND IN THE GUESSED EPISODE WOITH DOCTOR CRAG HELLER MY COLLEAGUE IN THE BIOLOGY DEPARTMENT AT STAMPFORD WHUCH UST VERY BRIEFLY THESE SURFACES THE UPPER HALF OF THE FACE THE PALMS OF THE HANDS IN THE BOMS OF THE FEET ARE WHAT WE CALL GLABYOROUS SKIN SURFACES G L A B R OU S LABYRITHS AND THOSE SURFACES ARE UNIQUE AND THAT JUST BELOW THEM THE VASCULATURE IS DIFFERENT THAN ELSEWHERE IN THE BODY NORMALLY THE PASSAGE OF BLOOD GOES FROM ARTERIES CAPULARIES TO VEINS BUT JUST BENEATH THE GLABYRIUS SKIN ON THE BOMS O THE FEET THE HANDS IN THE UPPER HALF OF THE FACE YOU HAVE WHAT ARE CALLED ARE TERIO VENOUS ASTEMOSES THESE ARE PORTALS OF BLOOD THAT GO DIRECTLY FROM ARTERIES TO VEINS AND IN DOING SO ALLOW THE BODY TO DUMP HEAT MORE READILY MORE QUICKLY SO AS IT TURNS OUT THAT IF YOU ARE TO COOL THE PALMS OF THE HANDS THE BOMS THE FEET AND UPPER HALF OF THE FACE YOU CAN MORE EFFICIENTLY REDUCE CORBODY TEMPERATURE FORSAKE OF OFFSETTING HYPROTHERMIA AND FOR IMPROVING ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE AND MAY BE EVEN COGNATIVE PERFORMANCE AT WE WILL RETURN TO THE SPECIFIC PROTOCALS FOR DOING THAT LATER IN THE EPISODE I'LL GIVE YOU LOTE DETAILS ABOUT HOW TO DO THAT HOW TO DO THAT WITHOUT THE USE OF ANY FANCY OR EXPENSIVE TECHNOLOGY THERE ARE SOME TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE NOW COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE FOR INSTANCE THE SO CALLED COOL MIT THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO DO THAT WITH MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY BUT ALSO GIVE YOU SOME AT HOME METHODS A TO DO THIS EITHER IN THE GIM OR ON RUNS OR FOR SAKE OF COGNIVE WORK O KSO THE TWO KEY THEMES AGAIN ARE UNDERSTAND THAT BASE LINE CIRCADIAN RHYTHM IN TEMPERATURE AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE BEST WAY TO COOL THE BODY IS GOING TO BE BY MAKING SURE THAT SOMETHING COLD CONTACTS THE BOLMS OF YOUR FEET THE PALMS YOUR HANDS AND THE UPPER HALF OF THE FACE IDEALLY ALL THREE IF YOUR GOAS TO LOWER CORBODY TEMPERATURE QUICKLY AND AGAIN JUST COOLING OFF THE BACK YOUR NECK OR THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD OR YOUR TORSO WITH A TAWEL IS GOING TO BE THE LEAST EFFICIENT WAY TO LOWER CORBODY TEMPERATURE AND MIGHT EVEN INCREASE BODY TEMPERATURE UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS OK WITH THOSE TWO POINTS IN MINE WE CAN START TO THINK ABOUT DIRECTED DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE PROTOCALS AND THERE ARE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT REASONS TO USE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE AND I WANT TO SEPARATE THOSE OUT FOR YOU THERE ARE COLD PROTOCOLS THAT HAVE BEEN TESTED IN PURE REVIEWED STUDIES THET ARE DESIGNE TO IMPROVE MENTAL PERFORMANCE THEY ARE DESIGNED TO IMPROVE THINGS LIKE RASILIENTS OR YOUR GRIDDINESS OR YOUR ABILITY TO MOVE THROUGH CHALLENGE OR TO REGULATE YOUR MIND AND YOUR INTERNAL STATE UNDER CONDITIONS OF STRESS AND WE CAN DEFINE STRESS VERY SPECIFICALLY AS TIMES WHEN A DRENALINE ALSO CALLED EPINEFERAN AND OR NOREPINEFERAN ALSO CALLED NORA DRENALINE ARE ELEVATED IN YOUR BODY FORGIVE ME FOR THE NORA DRENNALINE NORAPINEFRAN A DRENALINE EPINEFRO NOMIN CLATURE I DIDN'T MAKE THAT UP TURNS OUT THAT EVERYONE INOILE SCIENTISTS DISAGREE IMAGINE THAT AND YOU'LL GET MULTIPLE SCIENTISTS NAMING THE SAME MOLECULE DIFFERENT THINGS OCESO EPINEFRAN AND A DRENALNE ARE THE SAME THING I WILL USE THEM INTERCHANGEABLY NOREPINEFRAN AND NORA DRENALIN ARE THE SAME THING I WILL USE THOSE TERMS INTERCHANGEABLY NORA DRENALINE AND ADRENALINE ARE OFTEN CO RELEASED IN THE BRAIN AND BODY SO THEY WORK AS KIND OF A PAIR TO INCREASE OUR LEVEL OF AGITATION ARE LEVEL OF PHOCUS AND ARE DESIRE AND OUR ABILITY TO MOOVE THEY ARE OFTEN CO RELEASED FROM DIFFERENT SIDES IN THE BRAIN AND BODY WITH DOPOMINE A MOLECULE THAT IS COMMONLY MISUNDERSTOOD AS THE MOLECULE OF PLEASURE BUT IS ACTUALLY THE MOLECULE OF MOTIVATION REWARD AND PERSUIT SO DOPAMI NOREPANFRAN AN NORA DRENALINE TEND TO BE RELEASED TOGETHER UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS AND TODAY YOU WILL LEARN HOW DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE CAN BE USED TO CAUSE INCREASES IN THE RELEASE OF SEVERAL IF NOT ALL OF THESE IN WAYS THAT CAN IMPROVE YOUR LEVELS OF ATTENTION AND YOUR MOOD BUT THE KEY POINT IS THAT YOUR MENTAL STATE IS SHIFTED WHEN YOU ARE EXPOSED TO CERTAIN FORMS OF COLD AND MANY PEOPLE USE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE SPECIFICALLY TO SHIFT THEIR BODY STATE AS A WAY TO TRAIN THEIR MENTAL STATE SO THAT THEY CAN BETTER COPE WITH STRESS IN REAL LIFE AND BY REAL LIFE I MEAN WHEN LIFE PRESENT STRESSIBLE EVENTS AND I WILL GIVE YOU SPECIFIC PROTOCALS AS TO HOW YOU CAN DO THAT IN OTHER WORDS HOW YOU CAN BECOME MORE RESILIENT THROUGH TE USE OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE NOW BECAUSE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH DELIERATE COLD EXPOSURE CAN INCREASE THIS CATEGORY OF CHEMICALS CALLED THE CATECOLOMINES THAT INCLUDES DOPAMY NOR EPIN EFERN AN EPINEFRON IT CAN ALSO BE USED TO ELEVATE MOOD FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME AND I AM GOING TO DISCUSS A SPECIFIC PROTOCOL THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE THESE CHEMICALS ANYWHERE FROM TWO POINT FIVE ACTS A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PER CENT TO AS HIGH AS FIVE HUNDRED PERCENT FIVE TIMES OVER BASELINE NOW YOU MIGHT BE ASKING WHETHER NOT IS A GOOD THING TO RAISE CHEMICALS LIKE NOREPINFERAN AND DOPAMINE TO SUCH A GREAT DEGREE WHETHER NOT THAT'S HEALTHY FOR US WHETHER NOT THEY CAN HARM US BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT THESE ELEVATIONS IN NORAPINEFRAN AND DOPAMINE ARE VERY LONG LASTING IN WAYS THAT PEOPLE REPORT FEELING VAST IMPROVEMENTS IN MOOD AND VAST IMPROVEMENTS IN LEVELS OF COGNATIV ATTENTION AND ENERGY SO BY MY READ OF THE LITERATURE THESE SEEM TO BE HEALTHY INCREASES IN OUR BASE LINE LEVELS OF THESE CHEMICALS IN WAYS THAT CAN REALLY SUPPORT US WILL GIVE YOU A PROTOCOL FOR THAT NOW THOSE ARE SOME OF THE MENTAL EFFECT S OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE BUT DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE HAS ALSO BEEN STUDY INANIMAL MODELS AND IN HUMANS IN THE CONTECT OF INCREASING METABOLISM EVEN IN CONVERTING CERTAIN FAT CELLS THAT WE CALL WHITE FAT CELLS WHICH ARE THE ONES WHERE ENERGY IS STORED THE ONE THAT WE TYPICALLY THINK OF IS KIND OF BLUBBERY FAT TO BAGE OR BROWN FAT WHICH IS THERMOGENIC FAT MEANING THAT IT CAN INCREASE CORBODY TEMPERATURE AND SERVES AS AND OF THE FURNECE BY WHICH WE INCREASE ORE CORMATABOLISM SO WITH A VERY BROAD STROKE I CAN SAY THAT WHITE FAT IS GENERALLY THE KIND OF FAT THAT PEOPLE WANT LESS OF AND BAY FAT AND BROWN FAT IS GENERALLY THE KIND OF FAT THAT IF YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE FAT SELLS AND YOU CERTAINLY NEED FAT CELLS THAT YOU WANT MORE OF THEY ATHERMOGENIC THEY HELP YOU STAY LEAN THEASSHALY SERVE AS A RESERVOIR FOR HEATING YOUR BODY UP IF YOU R EVER CONFRONTED WITH T A COLD CHALLENGE SORDN TALK ABOUT HOW TO USE COLD FOR METABOLISM AS WELL AND OF COURSE PEOPLE ARE USING DELIVERATE COLD EXPOSURE TO REDUCE INFLAMMATION POST EXERCISE TO REDUCE INFLAMMATION GENERALLY AND PEOPLE ARE ALSO USING COLD TO ENHANCE PERFORMANCE IN THE CONTECT OF STRENGTH TRAINING IN THE CONTECT OF ENDURANCE TRAINING AND WILL TALK ABOUT THOSE DATAAS WELL BUT WHERE I LIKE TO START IS WITH MENTAL PERFORMANCE AND I LIKE TO DETAIL WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE DELIBERATELY EXPOSE OURSELVES TO COLD IT'S KEY TO POINT OUT THE WORD DELIBERATE IF I DON'T SAY OTHERWISE THEN THROUGHOUT THIS EPISODE IF I SAY COLD EXPOSURE I MEAN DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE AND THE REASON I POINT THAT OUT IS THAT AS MY COLLIGUE DAVID SPIGAL IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHITRYATE STAMFORD SAYS IT'S NOT TOUS ABOUT THE STATE THAT WE ARE IN IT'S ABOUT THE STATE THAT WE ARE IN AND WHETHER NOT WE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH PLACING OURSELVES INTO THAT STATE AND WHETHER R NOT WE DID THAT ON PURPOSE OR NOT AND WHAT HE REALLY MEANS BY THAT STATEMENT IS THAT THERE ARE IMPORTANT EFFECTS OF WHAT WE CALL MIND SET MIND SET WAS A TOPIC DISCUSTE IN THE GUEST EPISODE WITH ALLY CRUM SOME WEEKS AGO IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THAT EPISODE I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT AND THE SCIENCE OF MIND SET TELLS US THAT IF WE ARE DOING SOMETHING DELIBERATELY AND WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S GOING TO BE GOOD FOR US IT ACTUALLY CAN LEAD TO A DIFFERENT SET OF PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS THEN IF SOMETHING IS HAPPENING TO US AGAINST OUR WILL OR WITHOUT OUR CONTROL NOW THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN PLICIBO EFFECTS PLECEVO EFFECTS ARE DISTINCT FROM MIN SETEFFECTS DO ANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE DISTINCTION PLE SEE THE EPISODE WITH ALLY CRUM BUT AGAIN WHEN I TALK ABOUT COLD EXPOSURE IN THIS EPISODE IM TALKING ABOUT DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE MEANING THAT YOU ARE PLACING YOURSELF INTO A COLD ENVIRONMENT ON PURPOSE IN ORDER TO EXTRACT A PARTICULAR SET OF BENEFITS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE ALMOST ALWAYS THAT MEANS GETTING UNCOMFORTABLE AND ONE OF THE MOST COMMON QUESTIONS I GET WHEN DISCUSSING THE USE OF COLD FORSAKE OF MENTAL OR PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE METABOLISM ET CETERA IS HOW COLD SHOULD IT BE HOW COLD SHULD THE WATER BE HOW COLD SHOULD THE ENVIRONMENT BE AND I JUST WIL TELL YOU NOW AND I AM GOING TO SAY THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN THROUGHOUT THE EPISODE ECAUSE IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE TRUE THROUGHOUT THE EPISODE AND LONG AFTER THE EPISODE IS OVER HOW COLD DEPENDS ON YOUR COLD TOLERANCE YOUR COR METABOLISM AND A NUMBER OF OTHER FEATURES THAT THERE IS SIMPLY NO WAY I COULD KNOW OR HAVE ACCESS TO SO I WOULD LIKELY TO USE THIS RULE OF THUMB IF YOU ARE USING DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE THE ENVIRONMENT THAT YOU PLACE YOURSELF IN TO SHOULD PLACE YOUR MIND INTO A STATE OF WO I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO GET OUT OF THIS ENVIRONMENT BUT I CAN STAY IN SAFELY AND NOW THAT MIGHT SEEM A LITIBATE ARBITRARY BUT LET SAY YOU WERE TO GET INTO A WARM SHOWER AND IT WOULD FEL REALLY REALLY NICE AND YOU ERE TO START TURNING DOWN THE WARM AND TURNING UP THE COLD THERE WOULD BE SOME THRESHOLD AT WHICH IT WOULD FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE TO YOU AND IF YOU WERE TO CONTINUE TO MAKE A LITTLE BIT COLDER THAN THAT YOU WOULD REALLY WANT TO GET OUT OF THE SHOWER BUT YOU WERE CONFIDENT THAT YOU CAN STAY IN WITHOUT RISKING YOUR HEALTH RIGHT WITHOUT RISKING A HEART ATTACK NOW THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT THEN JUMPING INTO A VERY VERY COLD LAKE OR YOU KNOW I'VE SEEN THESE IMAGES OF PEOPLE THAT WILL CUT HOLDS INTO UM YOU KNOW FROZEN OVER LAKES AND THEY'LL GET INTO THAT COLD WATER IF YOU ARE TRAINED TO DO THAT AND YOU HAVE THE RIGHT CONDITIONS ET CETERA THAT CAN BE DONE REASONABLY SAFELY BUT THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT WHAT I WOULD START WITH AND FOR MANY PEOPLE THAT WILL BE TOO COLD AND INDEED SOME PEOPLE CAN GO INTO COLD SHOCK AND CAN DIE AS A CONSEQUENCE OF GATTING TO THAT EXTREMELY COLD WATER VERY QUICKLY NOW THAT'S NOT TO SCARE YOU AWAY FROM DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE IT'S JUST TO SAY THAT THERE'S NO SIMPLE PRESCRIPTIVE OF HOW COLD TO MAKE THE ENVIRONMENT IN ORDER TO EXTRACT MAXIMUM BENEFIT FOR MENTAL OR PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE SO THE SIMPLE RULE OF THUMB IS GOING TO BE PLACE YOURSELF INTO AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS UNCOMFORTABLY COLD BUT THAT YOU CAN STAY IN SAFELY CAND YOU'LL HAVE TO EXPERIMENT A BIT AND THAT NUMBER MEANING THAT TEMPERATURE WILL VARY FROM DAY TO DAY IT WILL VARY ACROSS THE TWENTY FOR OUR CYCLE BECAUSE OF THAT IN DOGENOUS MEANING THAT INTERNAL RHYTHM IN TEMPERATURE THAT I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER LOW EARLY IN THE DAY RISES INTO THE AFTERNOON DROPS AT NIGHT YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO THIS EXPERIMENT IF YOU LIKE TRY GETTING INTO A COLD SHOWER AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT IF YOU WANT VERSES TRY DOING IT IN THE IDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON IT'S QUITE A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE AND BY QUITE A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE I MEAN IT'S IT REQUIRES QUITE A DIFFERENT DEGREE OF RESILIENTE AND LEANING INTO THE PRACTICE YOUR WILL POWER WILL HAVE TO BE HIGHER I SUSPECT LATE IN THE DAY AS IT COMPARE TO EARLY IN THE DAY BUT THAT WILL VARY OF COURSE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS THAS WELL SO THE MOST COMMON QUESTION I GET ABOUT DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE IS HOW COLD SHOULD THE WATER BE AND WE'VE ANSWER THAT WITH UNCOMFORTABLY COLD TO THE POINT WHERE YOU WANT TO GET OUT WHET YOU CAN SAFELY STAY IN THE SECOND MOST COMMON QUESTION I GET ABOUT DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE IS WETHER NOT COLD SHOWERS ARE AS GOOD BETTER OR WORSE THAN CO LD WATER IMMERSION UP TO THE NECK FOR INSTANCE I ALSO GET A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT CROW CHAMBERS ARE BETTER THAN ALL THE OTHERS ET CETERA ET CETERA IAM GOING TO MAKE OL OF THAT VERY SIMPLE FOR YOU BY SAYING COLD WATER IMMERSION UP TO THE NECK WITH YOUR FEET AND HANDS SUBMERGED ALSO IS GOING TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE SECOND BEST WOULD BE COLD SHOWER THIRD BEST WOULD BE TO GO OUTSIDE WITH A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF CLOTHING BUT OF COURSE CLOTHING THAT IS CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE AND THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU TO EXPERIENCE COLD TO THE POINT WHERE YOU WOULD ALMOST WANT A SHIVER OR START SHIVERING NOW THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS THAT ARE GOING TO DICTATE WHETHEROR NOT YOU USE ONE FORM OF COLD EXPOSURE OR THE OTHER FOR INSTANCE SOME PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO COLD WATER IMMERSION THAT DON'T OF ACCIS TO ICE BATHS OR COLD WATER TANKS A COLD OCEAN OR COLD LAKES ET CETERA IN THAT CASE SHOWERS WOULD BE THE NEXT BEST SOLUTION I DO ONE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THEREHAVE BEEN VERY FEW IF ANY STUDIES OF COLD SHOWERS AND YOU CAN IMAGINE WHY THIS WOULD BE THE CASE IN A LABORATORY YOU WANT A CONTROL FOR AS MANY THAT VARIABLES AS POSSIBLE SO PLACING PEOPLE INTO A COLD WATER IMMERSION OR AN ICE BATH UP TO THE NECK AND INSISTING THAT THEY KEEP THEIR HANDS AND FEET UNDER IS VERY EASY TO CONTROL IT MEANS THAT EVERY ONE CAN DO ESSENTIALLY THE SAME THING WHEREAS WITH COLD SHOWERS PEOPLE ARE DIFFERENT SIZE BODIES SOME PEPLE ARE CON PUT THEIR HEAD UNDER SOME PEOPLE ARE GON ARE GOING TO LEAN FORWARD MEASURING THE AMOUNT OF COLD OF WATER EXPOSURE ON THE BODY IS VERY HARD TO DO AND SO THERE AREN'T A LOT OF STUDIES OF COLD SHOWERS BUT OF COURSE LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO COLD WATER IMMERSION SO THEY HAVE TO USE COLD SHOWERS AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO BOTH OF COURSE THAN GOING OUTSIDE ON A COLD DAY CAN BE OF BENEFIT BUT I WILL POINT OUT THAT THE HEAT TRANCE FER FROM YOUR BODY INTO WATER IS MUCH HIGHER FOR TIMES GREATER IF NOT EVEN GREATER DEPENDING ON THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER IN WATER AS SUPPOSED TO IN AIR SO IT'S GOING TO BE MUCH MORE EFFICIENT TO DO COLD WATER IMMERSION THAN ANYTHING ELSE COLD SHOWERS AFTER THAT AND PUT YOURSELF INTO A COLD ENVIRONMENT WOULD BE THE THIRD BEST THING I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO CROWD CHAMBERS BECAUSE THEY CARRY QUITE A HIGH DEGREE OF COST AND AGAIN THERE AREN'T MANY STUDIES OF THEM SO IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO CROWD CHAMBERS I'M SURE THAT THE CROWD CHAMBER FACILITY IS TOLD YOU ABOUT ALL THESE INCREDIBLE BENEFITS AND I DON'T DOUBT THAT SOME OF THOSE BENEFITS TRULY EXIST BUT MOST PEOPLE JUST DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES OR THE ACCESS TO THOSE WHO ARE GONTALLY CROWD CHAMBERS OUT OF TODAY'S DISCUSSION AND OF COURSE I REALIZE AS A FOURTH CATEGORY OF COLD EXPOSURE OUT THERE PEOPLE ARE WEARING ICE VESTS BELIEV ARE NOT THOSE EXIST ICE UNDERWEARE YES THOSE EXIST YOU CAN LOOK FOR THEM WHEN I AMASON IF YOU LIKE THEY ARE PUTTING COLD PACS IN THEIR ARM PITS ORE IN THEIR GROWING OR ELSEWHERE IN ORDER TO STIMULATE SOME OF THE EFFECTS OF COLD ON MENTAL AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE I'M NOT CAN ADDRESS THOSE IN TOO MUCH DETAIL TO DAY THEY CAN BE EFFICIENT IN CERTAIN WAYS BUT AS YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT LATER IN THE EPISODE COOLING THE PALMS THE UPPER FACE AND THE BOTTOMS OF THE FEET IS GOING TO BE FAR MORE EFFICIENT AND UNFORTUNATELY I THINK MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE USING ICE PACKSTO INCREASED OR CORMATABOLISM ARE NOT A WARE OF THE GLABER SKIN COOLING AND HOW IT CAN BE A VERY VERY POTENSTIMULUS WILL RETURN TO THAT A LATER UNLESS I SAY OTHERWISE IM MAINLY GOING TO BE FOCUSSING ON COLD WATER IMMERSION AND COLD SHOWERS SO LET'S TALK ABOUT PROTOCALS FOR ENHANCING MENTAL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE USING DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE GET IN TO COLD IS THAT WE EXPERIENCE AND INCREASE IN NOR EPINEFERON IN NORADRENANN RELEASE AND IN A DRENNALIN RELEASE THE FACT THAT COLD EXPOSURE DELIBERATE OR NO INCREASES NOR EPINEFERAN AN EPINEFRON IN OUR BRAIN AND BODY MEANS THAT IT IS A VERY RELIABLE STIMULUS FOR INCREASING NOR UPINEFER NEPINEFRON THAT SORT OF AN OBVIOUS STATEMENT BUT THAT OBVIOUS STATEMENT CAN BE LEVERAGED TO SYSTEMATICALLY BUILD UP WHAT WE CALL RAZILIENCE NOW WHEN WE EXPERIENCE A STRESSOR IN LIFE WHETHER NOT ITS SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS IN OUR RELATIONSHIP OR SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS IN THE WORLD AND WE FEEL STRESS THAT STRESS IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF INCREASES IN NOR EPINEFERON AND EPINFRON IN OUR BRAIN AND BODY VERY SIMILAR IF NOT IDENTICAL TO THE KINDS OF INCREASES THAT COME FROM DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE SO DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DELIBERATELY STRESS OUR BODY AND YET BECAUSE IT'S DELIBERATE AND BECAUSE WE CAN TAKE CERTAIN STEPS WHICH ALL DESCRIBE IN A MOMENT WE CAN LEARN TO MAINTAIN MENTAL CLARITY WE CAN LEARN TO MAINTAIN CALM WHILE OUR BODY IS IN A STATE OF STRESS AND THAT CAN BE IMMENSELY USEFUL WHEN ENCOUNTERING STRESSERS IN OTHER PARTS OF LIFE AND THAT'S WHAT WE CALL RAZILIENTS OR GRIT OURE ABILITY OR MENTAL TOUGHNESS OURE ABILITY TO LEAN INTO CHALLENGE OR TO TOLERATE CHALLENGE WHILE KEEPING OUR HEAD STRIGHT SO TO SPEAK SO ONE SIMPLE PROTOCAL FOR INCREASING RASILIENCE IS TO PICK A TEMPERATURE THAT'S UNCOMFORTABLE OF SHOWER OR COLD IMMERSION AND THEN TO GET IN FOR A CERTAIN DURATION OF TIME AND THEN TO GET OUT NOW IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE EXPERIENCE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF NOREPINEFRN AN ADRENNALIN RELEASE WHEN GETTING INTO COLD WATER SOME PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY DREAD THE COLD SO MUCH WE'LL ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE NOR EPINEFRAN AN EPINEFERANT INCREASES EVEN BEFORE THEY GET INTO TH COLD WATER OR UNDER THE COLD SHOWER NOW YOU MAY HAVE EXPERIENCES I'VE CERTAINLY EXPERIENCES IA'M DREADING IT I DON'T WANT TO DO IT AND I HAVE TO FORCE MYSELF TO DO IT AND INDEED EPINEFERAN IN NOR EPINEFERAN AND ITS SURGES CAN BE THOUGHT OF A SORT OF WALLS THAT WE HAVE TO CONFRONT AND GO OVER AND THI'D LIKE YOU TO CONCEPTIALIZE THEM THAT WAY BECAUSE IT ALLOWS US TO BUILD PROTOCALS THAT CAN BE VERY OBJECTIVE AND CAN ALLOW US TO MONITER OUR PROGRESS IN TERMS OF BUILDING RAZILIENCE SO ONE OPTION IS TO SIMPLY SAY OKE I 'M GOING TO FORCE MYSELF TO GET INTO THE COLD SHOWER FOR ONE MINUT HOW COLD AGAIN UN COMFORTABLY COLD BUT YOU CAN STAY IN SAFELY OR IAM GOING TO GET INTO THE ICE BATH FOR ONE MINUTE ICE BAS ARE VERY COLD A INEVITABLY ND WHAT IS ALSO INEVITABLE IS THAT WHEN YOU GET INTO THE COLD YOU WILL EXPERIENCE A SURGE IN EPINEPRON AND NOREPINEFRON THAT'S NONE NEGOTIABLE BECAUSE IT'S MEDIATED BY COLD RECEPTERS ON THE SURFACE OF YOUR BODY IN YOUR SKIN AND THE WAY THAT THEY TRIGGER THE RELEASE OF NOR EPINEFERN AND EPINEPRON NOT JUST FROM THE ADRENALS FROM THE ADREN AL LANDS ABOVE YOUR KIDNEYS BUT ALSO FROM REGIONS OF YOUR BRAIN LIKE THE LOCUS SERULIUS WHICH CAUSE INCREASES IN THE TENTION AND ALERTNESS AND FROM OTHER LOCATIONS IN YOUR BODY WHERE EPINEPRON AND NORPINERON AR RELEASED IN OTHER WORDS COLD IS A NON NEGOTIABLE STIMULUS FOR INCREASING EPINEPRON AND NOREPINEPRON EVEN IF YOU ARE THE TOUPHEST PERSON IN THE WORLD AND YOU LOVE THE COLD THAT INCREASE IN EPINEPRON AN NOREPINERON IS GOING TO HAPPEN SO THE WAY TO THINK ABOUT NOR UPIN EPERAN AN EPERON EFRON IN THIS CONTEXT OF BUILDING MENT RAZILIENS IS THAT YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS YOU CAN EITHER TRY TO EXTEND THE DURATION OF TIME THAT YOU ARE IN THE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE SO GOING FROM ONE MINUTE TO SEVENTY FIVE SECENDS TO TWO MINUTES AND SO ON OVER A PERIOD OF DAYS OR ONE WAY TO APPROACH THIS AND THE WAY THAT I PARTICULARLY FAVOR IS TO TAKE THE CONTEXT OF THE DAY AND THE MOMENT INTO ACCOUNT MEANING WE HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF GRIT AND RAZILINTS ON DIFFERENT DAYS AND DEPENDING ON THE LANDSCAPE OF OUR LIFE AT THE TIME EVEN THE TIME OF DAY THAT WERE DOING THESE PROTOCOLS AND START TO BE ABLE TO SENSE THE RELEASE OF EPIN EPRON EPINEPRANCSCUSE ME AND NORAPINEPRN AN OUR BRAIN AND BODY AND SEE THOSE AS WALLS THAT WE WANT TO CLIMB OVER IN ORDER TO BUILD RAZILIENTS AND TO START COUNTING THE NUMBER OF WALLS THAT WE TRAVERSE AND THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THOSE WALLS AS WE DO DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF THE TIME PROTOCAL BECAUSE THAT ONE IS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD ALTHOUGH I DO NOT THINK IT IS AS POWERFUL FOR BUILDING MENTAL RAZILINT THE TIME PROTOCOL WOULD BE MONDAY I DO ONE MINUTE OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE AT A GIVEN TEMPERATURE WEDNESDAY I EXTEND THAT BY FIFTY PER CENT AND FRIDAY I DO DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE FOR TWICE AS LONG AS I DID ON MONEDAY AND IF I WERE TO CONTINUE THAT EVERY WEEK MONDAY WHEN SEY FRIDAYI WOULD CONTINUE TO EITHER INCREASE THE DURATION OR I WOULD LOWER THE TEMPERATURE AND REDUCE THE DURATION THIS KIND OF THING VERY MUCH LIKE SETS IN REPTS IN THE GM NOW THAT OPTION IS VERY OBJECTIVE RIGHT YOU COULD EVEN LOG IT IN A BOOK AND AS YOU DEVELOPE THE ABILITY TO STAY IN COLD TEMPERATURES EVEN PROGRESSIVELY COLDER AND COLDER TEMPERATURES FOR LONGER AND LONGER PERIODS OF TIME YOU WILL BE COME MORE RAZILIENT WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT WHILE MY OPERATIONAL DEFINITION OF RAZILIENTS IS THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO RESIST ESCAPE FROM THE STRESSER THE COLD BY VIRTU U OF YOUR WILL POWER WHICH IS REALLY YOUR PREFRONTAL QUARTEX CAUSING TOP DOWN CONTROL ON YOUR REFLECTES AND YOUR LYMBIC SYSTEM IN YOUR HYPOTHALEMIS WHICH ARE BASICALLY TELLING YOU TO GET OUT OF THAT COLD WATER GET OUT OF THAT COLD ENVIRONMENT AND IN DOING SO YOU ARE BASILY GETTING BETTER AT CONTROLLING YOUR BEHAVIOR WHEN YOUR BRAIN ANBODY ARE FLOODED WITH NOR UPAN EFFERAN AN EPON EFERON THAT'S A VERY REDUCTIONIST WAY TO EXPLAIN RAZILIENTS OR GREAT OR MENTAL TOUGHNESS BUT IT'S A REDUCTIONIST WAY OF EXPLAINING IT THAT IS VERY CLOSELY TIED TO THE BIOLOGY END TOF THE PSYCHOLOGY AND IT IS A FACT THAT NOR UP AN EFFERAN AN EPINEFERAN RELEASE IN THE BRAIN ENBODY ARE THE GENERIC UNIVERSAL COD FOR STRESSER THERE IS NO UNIQUE CHEMICAL SIGNATURE FOR DIFFERENT FORMS OF STRESSERS THAT IS THE ONLY ONE ALTHOUGH OF COURSE THEIR OTHER CHEMICALS IN VALL DOS WELL SO YOU COULD GO FOR TIME AND YOU COULD TRY AND REDUCE THE TEMPERATURE AND INCREASE THE TIME OVER PERIOD OF DAYS OR WEEKS NOW THAT'S AN ATTRACTIVE WAY TO APPROACH THINGS BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE AN INFINITE A MOUN OF ROOM WITH WHICH TO LOWER TEMPERATURE BECAUSE EVENTUALLY YOU WILL GET INTO TEMPERATURES THAT ARE EITHER SO COLD THAT THEY ARE DANGEROUS OR YOU HAVE TO STAY IN COLD TEMPERATURES FOR SUCH LONG PERIODS THAT IT BECOMES IMPRACTICAL BECAUSE PRESUME W U ALSO HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF OTHER ASPECTS OF YOUR LIFE YOU CANT JUST SIT ALL DAY IN THE ICE BATH NOW FOR THAT REASON I FAVOR A PROTOCAL IN WHICH YOU BUILD MENTAL RAZILIENTS AND MENTAL TOUGHNESS THROUGH TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROTOCALS THE FIRST ONE INVOLLS COUNTING WALLS NOW WHAT DON'T MEAN BY WALLS I MEAN THE SENSATION OF NO I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS AND THE IDEA OR THE SENSATION IN YOUR BRAIN AN BODY THAT YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO LEAVE THAT ENVIRONMENT AND GO WARM OP NOW AGAIN FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT WILL BE EVEN BEFORE GETTING INTO THE ICE BATH OR COLD SHOWER SO IF YOU ARE FEELING VERY RESISTANT TO GETTING INTO THE ICE BATH OR COLD SHOWER AND YOU MANAGE TO DO THAT THATS GOING OVER WHAT I WILD CALL ONE WALL OKE THEND  FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY FEEL COMFORTABLE IN THE ICE BATH COLD WATER OR COLD SHOWER AND YOU FEEL LIKE YOU COULD STAY THERE FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME THAT YOU COULD SAY THERE FOR A MINUTE OR TWO MINUTES BUT INEVITABLY THE NEXT WALL WILL ARRIVE AND I WOULD INCURAGE YOU TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHEN THAT NEXT WALL ARIVES AND ACTUALLY HAVING AN AWARENESS THAT SO CALLED INTEROCEPTIVE AWARENESS AS WE CALL IT OF WHEN THAT NEXT SURGE IN A DRENNALIN EPAN EFFERON COMES OR WHETHER NOT IT REACHES US CERTAIN THRESHOLD IN YOUR BRAIN BODY TAT YOU FEEL YOU WANT TO GET OUT AND YOU ARE ABLE TO STAY IN FOR EVEN JUST TEN SECONDS LONGER THAT MEANS YOU'VE TRAVERSED YET ANOTHER WALL AND IF YOU CONTINUE TO STAY IN THAT COLD ENBIRONMENT YOU WILL FIND THAT THE NEXT WALL WILL COME AN THE NEXT WALL WILL COME NOW EVENTUALLY OF COURSE YOU WILL GET VERY VERY NUM DEPENDINGON HOW COLD IT IS AND YOU COULD ALSO PLACE YOURSELF INTO DANGER SO YOU HAVE TO MAINTAIN COGNE OF CONTROL COUNTING THESE WALLS TRAVERSING THESE WALLS BUT GETTING OUT AT SOME POINT OF COURSE SO MY FAVORITE PROTOCAL FOR BUILD LING MENTAL TOUGHNESS A C GRIT A C RAZILIENTS IS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT SOME DAYS JUST GETTING INTO THE ICE BATHRICOL CHOWER REPRESENTS A WALL SOME DAYS IT DOESN'T SOME DAYS YOU GET IN AND YOU FEEL LIKE YOU GU GO TEN MINUTES OTHER DAYS YOU GET IN AND YOU FEEL LIKE YOU COULD ONLY GO A MINUTE AND SETTING A DESIGNATED NUMBER OF WALLS BEFORE YOU START THE PROTOCOL IS GOING TO BE VERY BENEFICIAL HERE SO YOU SAY AS LONG AS I CANTO IT SAFELY I'M GOING TO DO THREE WALLS TO DAY THE FIRST WALL IS GETTING IN THE SECOND WALL WILL ARRIVE WHEN IT ARRIVES AND THE THIRD WALL WILL ARRIVES WHEN IT ARRIVES AND I'LL GET OVER THAT WALL THAN I'LL GET OUT THE NEXT DAY YOU MIGHT DO FIVE WALLS THE NEXT DAY YOU MIGHT DO THREE WALLS AGAIN BUT YOU MIGHT LOWER THE TEMPERATURE THIS GIVES YOU TREMENDOUS FLEXIBILITY AND INDEED IT GIVES YOU MUCH MORE LATITUDE TO BE ABLE TO USE THE SAME TEMPERATURES IN DIFFERENT WAYS OR TO REDUCE THE TEMPERATURE ONLY A LITTLE BIT AND STILL GET A LOT OF STIMULUS MEANING A LOT OF RESULTS OUT OF A GIVEN PROTOCOL WHEREAS PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST GOING FOR TEMPERATURE AN TIME EVENTUALLY BECOME COLD ADAPTED THEY GET VERY VERY GOOD AT DOING THREE MINUTES OR SIX MINUTES OR EVEN TEN MINUTES AT A GIVEN TEMPERATURE AND SO THEN THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE TO LOWER THE TEMPERATURE EVEN MORE AND EVEN MORE AND EVENTUALLY THEY JUST BOUTOM OUT THERE'S NOWHERE ELSE TO GO THERE'S NOWHERE TO GET IMPROVEMENTS OUT OF THE PROTOCOL AT LEAST NOT IN TERMS OF MENTAL RAZILIENTS OF COURSE THERE STILL THE POS OF EFFECTS ON INFLAMMATION AND METABOLISM ET CETERA THAT WILL TALK ABOUT IN A LITTLE BIT BUT THE KEY THING HERE IS TO DESIGN PROTOCOLS THAT ARE GOING TO WORK FOR YOU OVER TIME AND FOR YOU VERY VERY HARTY VERY VERY TOUGH GUISING GALLS OUT THERE THAT CAN GET RIGHT INTO AN ICE BATH OR VERY VERY COLD IMMERSION AND YOU CAN JUST GRIND IT OUT FOR SIX OR TEN MINUTES OR YOU CAN EVEN DO THAT BY REMAINING PEACEFUL WELL MORE POINTS TO YOU BUT GESS WHAT THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF ALREADY HAVING LOADED UP THE BAR BELL WITH SIX HUNDRED POUNDS AND DONE YOUR TEN RAPTS THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT MORE VARIABLE SPACE WITH WHICH TO GET BENEFITS FROM THAT STIMULUS AND IN THE WEIGHT ROOM PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU CAN ADJUST FOR INSTANCE THE SPEED OF THE MOVEMENT OR YU CAN START COMBINING THAT MOVEMENT WITH PRE EXHAUSTION ET CETERA WITH COLD EXPOSURE YOU DON'T HAVE AS MUCH VARIABLE SPACE TO PLAY WITH SO IF YOU'RE GOAL IS TO BUILD RASILIENTS EITHER GO FOR TIME AS A FUNCTION OF TEMPERATURE OR WHAT I SUGGEST IS TO START RECOGNIZING THESE WALLS AS AN EXPERIENCE OF RESISTANCE IN YOU AND GOING OVER THOSE WALLS SET A CERTAIN NUMBER OF WALLS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GO OVER ON A GIVEN DAY AND DO THAT AT A GIVEN TEMPERTURE AND THEN TO MIX IT UP AND IDEALLY YOU MIGHT EVEN THROW IN ONE MORE WALL AT THE END IF YOU'RE REALLY FEELING BOLD AND BRAVE BECAUSE THAT'S CAN TO BUILD OUT FURTHER RAZILIENTS BUT IF YOU WANT COLD EXPOSURE TO WORK FOR YOU FOR SAKE OF BUILDING UP RAZILIEN TO MENTAL TOUGHNESS OVER TIME YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO VARY THIS PERAMETER SPACE IN SOME SORT OF WAY AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SUPERSYSTEMATIC ABOUT IT THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF THIS KIND OF APPROACH BECAUSE YOUR RELYING ON THE FFACT THAT THOSE WALLS REAL LY REPRESENT TIMES IN WHICH YOU ARE FORCING YOUR TOP DOWN CONTROL YOUR PREFRONTAL QUARTEX TO CLAMP DOWN ON YOUR REFLEX AND YOUR LEARNING BEHAVIORAL CONTROL IN THE CONTEXT OF YOUR BODY HAVING ELEVATED LEVELS OF THESE CATACOLA MENES NOR PINFERAN AN EPINEFERON AND THAT TRANSLATES TO REAL LIFE IN A MUCH MORE REALISTIC WAY I BELIEVE BECAUSE IN REAL LIFE YOU ARE NOT REALLY ENGAGING IN STRESSERS FOR A GIVEN AMOUNT OF TIME THAT YOU KNOW HOW LONG ITS CAN A LAST AND YOU KNOW THE CONTEXT NO MOST STRESSERS ARRIVE IN THE FORM OF SURPRISES WE DON'T LIKE TEX MESSAGES THAT DELIVER BAD NEWS INFORMATION ABOUT THE OUTSIDE WORLD OR REAL WORLD AND ON LINE INTER ACTIONS THAT SEND OUR SYSTEM INTO A STATE OF INCREASE NOR EPINEFERAN AN EPINEFERON AND IF YOU START TO THINK OF THOSE AS WALLS THAT YOU CON TOLERATING CLIMB OVER WHILE STAYING CALM AND CLEAR OF MIND THEN YOU CAN REALLY IMAGINE HOW THE ICE BATH AND OTHER FORMS OF COLD EXPOSURE ARE REALLY SERVING TO TRAIN YOU UP FOR REAL LIFE STRESSERS O CA THE NEXT QUESTION THAT I ALWAYS GET IS WHAT SHOULD MY MENTAL STATE BE WHILE I AM EXPOSING MYSELF TO THIS UNCOMFORTABLE YET SAFE CONDITION OF COLD WELL YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS AN THEIR PROBABLY OTHER OPTIONS AS WELL ONE IS TO TRY AND CALM YOURSELF TO REMAIN AS MENTALLY STILL AS POSSIBLE THE OTHER IS TO LEAN INTO THAT CHALLENGE AND SO TO GRIND IT OUT AND HERE I HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS IS A LOT LIKE TEACHING SOME ONE TO DRIVE ON A GRAVEL ROAD FOR ANY OF YOU THAT HAVE DRIVEN ON A GRAVEL ROAD YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS NO OPTIMAL SPEED FOR ALL GRAVEL ROADS TOT DEPENDS ON THE DENSITY THE GRAVEL ET CETERA AND THE VEHICLE ET CETERA SO FOR INSTANCE ON SOME GRAVEL ROADS WHEN YOU START TO DRIVE IN THE DUST STARTS TO KICK UP YOUR BEST OPTION IS TO DRIVE FAST AND PUT THAT DUST CLOUD BEHIND YOU ON OTHER GRAVEL ROADS IF YOU TRY AND DO THAT THE DUST ACTIOUL KICKS UP AROUND THE VEHICLE AD MAKES IT HARD TO SEE SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO SLOW DOWN THE SAME THING IS TRUE FOR GETTING THROUGH DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE SOME TIMES IT'S EASIER TO CALM YOURSELF ONE WAY TO DO THAT IS THROUGH DOUBLE INHALES THROUGH THE NOSE AND EXTENDED EXELES THROUGH THE MOUTH OR SIMPLY BY TRING TO CONTROL YOUR BREATHING AND REDUCE THE PACE OF YOUR BREATHING AND INCREASE THE VOLUME OF YOUR BREATHING I HAVE TO SAY THAT EVERY ONE EXPERIENCES A SHORTENING O BREATH WHEN THEY GET INTO UNCOMFORTABLY COLD WATER THAT IS A UNIVERSAL PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE EVERYONE ALSO EXPERIENCES A THIRTY TO EIGHTY PERCENT DECREASE IN COGNATIVE FUNCTION IN PARTICULAR OF THE FRONTAL QUARTEX THE METABOLISM YOUR FRONT OF QUARTEC GOES DOWN THE METABOLISM MEANING THE ACTIVITY OF BRAINAIRIES ASSOCIATED WITH STRESS AND PANIC GOES WAY UP AND SO ANCHORING YOUR MIND IN COGNATIVE ACTIVITIES AS YOU GET INTO THE COLD CAN BE VERY VERY HELPFUL FOR MAINTAINING CLARITY OF MIND FACT ONE THING THAT I SOMETIMES RECOMMEND IS THAT PEOPLE TRY AND ENGAGE IN SOME SORT OF COGNATIVE EXERCISE WHILE IN THE COLD NOT AS A FORM OF DISTRACTION BUT AS A WAY TO MAINTAIN CLARITY OF THINKING IT TO LEARN HOW TO DO THAT WHEN THE BODY IS FLOODED WITH ALL THESE CHEMICALS THAT MAKE US ST REST SO FOR INCT AS YOU COULD DO MATH PROBLEMS AND NOT TOO PLESS TO EQUALS FOR NOT YOONG THREE TIMES TOR EQUALS NINE BUT THINGS THAT REQUIRE A LITTLE BIT MORE FOCAS AND ATTENTION WORKING MEMORY AND SO FORTH YOU COULD ALSO START TO HAVE THOUGHTS THAT YOU DELIBERATELY IMPOSE A FULL SENTENT STRUCTURE ON THAT'S ACTUALLY QUITE TOUGH YOU COULD TRY IND RECALL SPECIFIC BOUTS OF INFORMATION THAT ARE CHALLENGING THIS IS TEACHING YOUR MIND HOW TO STAY ON LINE OR RATHER I SHOULD SAY THIS IS YOU TEACHING YOUR PREFRONT AL QUARTEX HOW TO STAY ENGAGED WHILE YOU HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF STRESS IN YOUR BODY YEARS AGO I HAD A FRIEND WHO WHO WORKS IN THE NOROL SCIENCE WORLD RESEARCHINRAL SCIENTISTS WHO IS OBSESSED WITH A THIS VERY BAZAR SPORT THAT I DON'T NESSARILY RECOMMEND AT ALL WHICH IS THE COMMINATION OF BOXING AND CHESS YOU MAY AVE SEEN THIS ON YOU TOO WHERE PEOPLE WILL BOX AROUND LEGITIMATE BOXING AROUND THEIR SPARRING ALL OUT OFTEN AND THEN AT THE END OF THE ROUND INSTEAD OF RESTING IN THE CORNER THEY ACTUALLY SIT DOWN AND PLAY CHESTS AND THEN THEY GO BACK TO BOXING AND BACK TO CHEST AGAIN NOT A SUPPORT THAT I RECOMMEND BUT THE REASON HE WAS OBSESSED WITH THIS IS BECAUSE HE STUDIES THE IMPACT OF STRESS ON COGNIVE PERFORMANCE AND WHAT THAT PARTICULAR VERY BAZAAR SPORT WAS DOING WAS TOGGLING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN DIFFERENT STATES OF MIND NOW IT'S USED BOTH TO INCREASE COGNATIVE CLARITY FOR THE FIGHTER WHEN THEY BOX BECAUSE STAYING CALM AND CLEAR THINKING IS VERY IMPORTANT TO WINNING BOXING MATCHES IT BELEVER NOT IT'S NOT IN ALL OUTRAGE IT'S A VERY CALCULATED GAME OF MENTAL CHESS AND PHYSICAL CHEST THAT'S QUITE HIGH STAKES AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IT'S ALSO USED IN SOME CIRCLES AS A WAY TO TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO ENGAGE IN COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE WHEN THEIR BODY IS SIMPLY FILLED WITH STRESS SO IN THE BOXING CHESTS EXAMPLE THE REPLACEMENT FOR THE COLD WATER IS ACTUALLY THE BOXING WRITE ITS THE THING THAT SPOSE TO INDUCE THE STRESS IS GETTING HIT ISTRESSFUL AND THE RISK OF GETTING HIT DISTRESSFUL FOR MOST PEOPLE SO AGAIN IF YOU THINK ABOUT DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE AS A WAY OF JUST SYSTEMATICALLY AND RELIABLY INDUCING APINEFRNAN OR APINEFRAN RELEASE AND DELIVERING STRESS WILL THEN THIS IDEA OF MAINTAINING COGNIOVE CLARITY IN ACTUALLY ENGAGING IN COGNIOVE TASKS WHILE IN THE ICE BATH OR COLD SHOWER CAN ACTUALLY BE VERY BENEFICIAL EVEN THOUGH MIGHT SOUND A LITEBATE SILLY YOU ARE REALLY TRAINING UP YOUR ABILITY TO KEEP YOUR BRAIN WORKING WHEN THE REFLECK IS TO SHUT DOWN THE PARTS OF YOUR BRAIN THAN INVOLVED IN DELIBERATE PLANNING AND THINKING NOW ANOTHER IMPORTANT ASPECT OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE THAT I RARELY IF EVER HERE DISCUSSE BUT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT IS WHETHER NOT YOU MOVE AROUND OR NOT HERE'S THE REASON WHEN YOU GET INTO COLD WATER AND YOU REMAIN THERE FOR SOME PERIOT OFE TIME YOUR BODY IS GENERATING HEAT AND THAT HEAT GENERATES WHAT'S CALLED A THERMAL LAYER THAT SURROUNDS YOUR ENTIRE BODY SO IF YOU STAY STILL YOU ARE ACTUALLY WARMER THAN IF YOU MOVE AROUND YOU CAN TRY THIS THE NEXT TIME YOUR DOING YOUR DELIBERATE COLLED EXPOSURE IF YOU ARE SUBMERGE UP TO THE NECK SIT THERE F UREABOUT TEN THIRTY SECONDS AND BE VERY VERY STILL OF BODY IN FACT THIS IS THE WAY THAT MOST PEOPLE START TO DO DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE THEY GIVE THIS VERY STOIC LOOK THEY DON'T BLANK THEY LOOK VERY PEACEFUL SOME OF THEM EVEN LOOK TOUGH LIKE IT OR THEY MAKE A VERY A YOU KNOW EVEN A EMOTIONAL FACE AND SO IT LOOKS LIKE THE THER REALLY TOUGH BUT THEY ARE SO STILL THAT BELIEVE IT ARE NOT THEY ARE NOT PROVIDING THE MOST POTENT STIMULUS IF THEY OR YOU WERE TO MOVE AROUND IN THAT WATER WHET WOULD HAPPEN AS YOU BREAK UP THE THORM MALAYR AND THAT YOU ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE THAT IS MUCH COLDER SO IF YOU REALLY WANT A PUSH THE RAZILIENT'S ASPECT OR FOR INSTANCE IF YOU WANT TO USE A GIVEN TEMPERATURE THAT YOUR COMFORTABLE AND BUT THAT YOU WANT TO INCREASE THE STIMULUS AND YOU WANT TO GET SO MORE BENEFIT FOR MENTAL RAZILIENTS TRAINING WELL THEN GET INTO THE COLD WATER MOVE YOUR BODY AROUND CONTINUOUSLY BUT TRY AND KEEP YOUR MIND STILL OR EVEN DO SOME SORT OF COGNIVE TASK SO AS YOUR TRYING TO REALIZE THERE ARE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT VARIABLES THAT YOU CAN PLAY WITH WILL MAINTAINING THE SAME TEMPERATURE OF WATER AND IN DOING SO REALLY KEEP YOU IN THE ZONE OF WHAT SHOULD AND ABSOLUTELY HAS TO BE SAFE FOR YOU WITHOUT HAVING TO JUST CONTINUALLY DROP THE TEMPERATURE FROM SAY SIXTY DEGREES TO FIFTY FIVE TO FORTY TO THIRTY THIRTY BECAUSE AS I MENTUON BEFORE VENTUALLY YOU'R GON A BOTTOM OUT SO IF YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THEY LIKES TO LOOK TOUGH OR REALLY RELAXED WHILE YOU'RE IN THE ICE BATH OR COLD WATER IMMERSION JUST REALIZE THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY CHEATING YOURSELF OUT OF PART OF THE STIMULUS KEEP THOSE LIMBS MOVING AND OF COURSE LIMBS UNDER THE WATER FEET AND HANDS IS GOING TO BE A MORE POTENT STIMULUS THAN HANDS AND FEET OUT FOR REASONS THAT SHOULD BE OBVIOUS BASEIN WHT WE TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF GLABOR SKIN COOLING TO KEEP THOSE SUBMERGE MOVE YOUR BODY PETAL MAYBE MOVE YOUR KNEES UP AND DOWN PETDL YOUR FEET AND TRUST ME ITS GOING TO FEEL A LOT COLDER THAN WERE YOU TO REMAIN STONE STILL ANOTHER VERY COMMON QUESTION IS HOW OFTEN TO DO DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE IT'S TOUGH TO MAKE A RECOMMENDATION ON THAT BASED ON ANY PUREVIEWED STUDY ALTHOUGH THERE ARE A FOU IN HUMANS THAT POINT TO A THRESHOLD OF ELEVEN MINUTES TOTAL PER WEEK SO THAT TOTAL THROUGHOUT THE WEEK DIVIDED INTO TWO OR FOR SESSIONS OF TWO OR THREE MINUTES ARE SO NOW THAT ELEVEN MINUTE CUT OFF IS NOT A STRICT THRESHOLD AND IS ACTUALLY GEARED MORE TOWARDS INCREASES IN METABOLISM WILL GET INTO THIS LOE IT LATER IN THE EPISODE BUT I THINK THE ELEVEN MINUTE THRESHOLD MEANING ELEVEN MINUTES TOTAL OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE PER WEEK IS A PRETTY GOOD NUMBER TO USE IF YOU NEED A NUMBER IN ORDER TO KEEP YOU CONSISTENT BUT AS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLI ER SOME OF YOU ARE GOING TO BE IN THE ICE BATH OR COLD IMMERSION OR COLD SHOWER FOR ONE MINUTE OTHERS OF YOU WILL BE IN THERE FOR TEN MINUTES DEPENDING ON HOW FREQUENT AND HOW HIGH IF YOU WILL THOSE WALLS OF A DRENALIN ARE COMING SO FOR SOME OF YOU GETTING INTO A COLD SHOWER FOR THREE MINUTES TOTAL FOR THE WHOLE WEEK WILL REPRESENT A TREMENDOUS ACHIEVEMENT IN TERMS OF WILL POWER AND OVERCOMING THE RESISTANCE TO DOING THAT OVERCO MING THOSE WALLS FOR OTHERS OF YOU THREE MINUTES IS NOTHING SO WHAT DO I RECOMMEND I RECOMMEND THAT YOU GET AT LEAST ELEVEN MINUTES TOTAL PER WEEK BUT AT THE POINT WHERE ELEVEN MINUTES TOTAL PER WEEK IS VERY EASY FOR YOU AS NO LONGER REPRESENTING A SIGNIFICANT MENTAL CHALLENGE MEANING YOURE NOT EXPERIENCING MANY OF THESE WALLS YOURE EXCITED TO GET INTO THE COLD SHOWER IMMERSION YOUARE GOING THROUGH IT EASILY YOUR CRUISING BASICALLY THEN I WOULD SAY EITHER LOWER THE TEMPERATURE SAFELY OF COURSE EXTEND THE DURATION SAFELY OF COURSE OR INCREASE THE FREQUENCY SO THAT YOU'RE DOING THIS PERHAPS EVERY DAY OR MAY BE FIVE DAYS A WEEK OR THREE DAYS A WEEK I PERSONALLY GET TREMENDOUS BENEFIT FROM DOING DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE THREE TIMES A WEEK AND USING THE WALVS METHOD THAT I DESCRIBED EARLIER AS MY GAUGE FOR HOW LONG TO STAY IN AND TYPICALLY THAT MEANS THAT I'M STAYING IN FOR ANYWHERE FROM TWO MINUTES TO SIX MINUTES PERSESSION AND THAT AVERAGES OUT TO A DOUT A LEVEN TO FIFTEEN MINUTES TOTAL PER WEAK SO AGAIN I DO NOT THINK THAT YOU NEED TO BE SUPERSTRICT ABOUT THESE GUIDELINES IT'S MOST IMPORTANT WHEN EMBRACING A PROTOCOL A THAT YOU DO IT SAFELY BUT SECONDARILY THAT YOU DO IT CONSISTENTLY SO FIND WHAT YOU CAN DO CONSISTENTLY AND THEN VARY THE PERAMETERS THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO CONTINUE TO DO DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE CONSISTENTLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT YOU HAVE ACCESS TO A SHOWER OR COLD IMMERSION ET CETERA O CASE HAT WEV BEEN TALKING ABOUT MENTAL EFFECTS AND THE USE OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE FORSAKE OF BUILDING REZILIENTS WHICH I DO BELIEVE CAN BE TREMENDOUSLY POWERFUL BUT IT'S NO COINCIDENCE THAT THE SCREENING AND THE TRAINING FOR NAVY SEALS INVOLVES A LOT OF EXPOSURE TO COLD WATER ONE COULD ARGUE THAT IT IS DELIBERATE BECAUSE THEY ELECT TO GO TO BUDS BUT WHEN THEY GET INTO THE COLD WATER AT BUDS IS DICTATED BY THE INSTRUCTORS AND THE REASON THEY USE COLD WATER EXPOSURE AS THE STRESSER IS THAT IT DOES OFFER CONSIDERABLE LEEWAY IN TERMS OF DURATION AND TEMPERATURE IN TERMS OF HOW YOU CAN USE IT AS A STRESSOR WERSTINGS LIKE HEAT DON'T OFFER MUCH VARIABLE SPACE AS WE SAY THERE ISN'T A LOT OF ROOM BEYOND WHICH YOU START INJURING OR EVEN KILLING PEOPLE BY USING HEAT SO THEIRE LOT OF FORMS OF STRESSORS OUT THERE BUT COLD IS ONE THAT WE CAN TITRATE THAT WE CAN ADJUSTIN WAYS THAT CAN ALLOW US TO CONTINUALLY BUILD UP AND OR MAINTAIN MENTAL TOUGHNESS NOW DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE ALSO HAS MANY EFFECTS ON CHEMICALS OTHER THAN NOREPINEFRON AN EPINEFRON MOST NOTABLY THE NEUROMODULATOR DOPAOMINE WHICH IS INVOLVED IN ELEVATING OUR MOOD MAKING US FEEL ENERGIZED AND ENHANCING OUR ABILITY TO FOCUS AND THAT HAS A LOT TO DO WITHHOW DOPAMINE ENGAGES US IN MOTIVATED STATES TENDS TO NARROWER THINKING IN OUR BEHAVIOR INTO A PARTICULAR TRENCH OF GOL DIRECTED BEHAVIOR YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT DOPOMNE YOU CAN LEARN A LOT ABOUT DOPOMINE IN OUR EPISODE ABOUT DOPOMINUTS THAT HUBRM LABDOUTCOM YOU CONFINED IT'S A TWO AND A HALF HOUR PLUS A CAN A DEAP DIVE INTO ALL THINGS DOPOMINE FOCUS MOTIVATION ET CETERA DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE HAS A VERY POWERFUL EFFECT ON THE RELEASE OF DOPAMINE IN OUR BRAIN ENBODY AND THIS IS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WHY PEOPLE CONTINUE TO DO DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE BASICALLY IT MAKES US FEEL GOOD AND IT CONTINUES TO MAKE US FEEL GOOD EVEN AFTER WE GET OUT OF THE COLD ENVIRONMENT INS FACT SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY THEY DON'T FEEL GOOD IN THE COLD ENVIRONMENT IT'S ALL STRESS FOR THEM BUT AFTERWARDS THEY FEEL GREAT ONE OF OUR PREVIOUS GUESTS DOCTOR ON ALEMPKI WHOSE A MEDICAL DOCTOR AT STAMPORD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL MEDICINE SHEES A CLOSE COLLIGOMINE DESCRIBED THE USE OF DOPAMINE IN HER BOOK DOPAMI NATION AN INCREDIBLE BOOK ABOUT A DICTION IN DOPAMINA SHOULD MENTION AND THE USE OF DOPAMINE ELICITED BY COLD WATER IT EXPOSURE BY ONE OF HER PATIENTS WHAT I'M REFERRING TO IS THE FACT THAT ONE OF HER PATIENTS HELPED THEMSELVES GET AND STAY SOBER OFF DRUGS BY USING DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE TO INCREASE DOPAMINE SO A HEALTHIER FORM OF DOPAMINE RELEASE THAN THEY WERE ENGAGED IN PRIOR TO GETTING SOBER NOW THE BASIS FOR DOPAMINE RELEASE IN RESPONSE TO COLD EXPOSURE IS THAT THE CATACOLAMINES NOR UPAN EPRONEPAN EFRAN AND DOPAMINE TEN TO BE CO RELEASED BY THE SAME SORTS OF STIMULE BUT MOST STRESSERS AND IN PARTICULAR THINGS THAT EVOKED STRESS WERE AUR FEELINGS OF STRESS INTERNALLY THAT WE DON'T LIKE DO NOT INCREASE DOPAMINE THEY ONLY INCREASE IN ARPAN EFRN ANEPINEFERON BUT DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE SEEMS TO CAUSE A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN DOPAMINE AND THIS HAS ACTUALLY BEEN SUBSTANTIATED IN A REALLY BEAUTIFUL STUDY ENTITLED HUMAN PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES TO IMMERSION INTO WATER OF DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES THE FIRST AUTHOR IS STRAMIC A M ALMOST CERTAINLY PRONOUNCING THAT POORLY IF AND IF NOT INCORRECTLY S AR A AN E K THIS WAS PUBLISHD IN THE EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND REALLY A BEAUTIFUL STUDY I LOVE THIS STUDY THEY TOOK PEOPLE AND THEY HAD THEM SIT IN CHAIRS UNDER WATER BUT THEIR HEAD WAS OUT AND THEY WERE SO THEY WERE MERSED UP TO THE NECK IN EITHER THREE DIFFERENT EITHER OF THREE DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE CUSE ME THIRTY TWO DEGREE SELSIUS WHICH IS EIGHTY NINE DEGREES FARENEITE TWENTY DEGREE SELSIUS WHICH IS SIXTY EIGHT DEGREES FARENHEITE OR FOURTEEN DEGREE CELSIUS WHICH IS FIFTY SEVEN POINT TWO DEGREES FARENHEITE SO NOT SUPER COLD BUT THEN WHAT THEY DID IS THEY MEASURED PEOPLE'S CORBODY TEMPERATURE THROUGHOUT THEY MEASURED THEIR METABOLISM AND THEY LOOKED AT SYRUM LEVELS OF THINGS LIKE NOR UP AN EFERAN EPINEFRON DOPAMINE INCORDIZUL CYRAMENING WITHIN THE BLOOD SO REALLY NICE AND QUITE THOROUGH STUDY THERE WERE NOT A HUGE NUMBER OF SUBJECTS IN THE STUDY BUT NONE THE LESS IT WAS A VERY THOROUGH STUDY IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF VARIABLES THAT THEY EXPLORED SO I JUST ONE OF BRIEFLY HIGHLIGHT SOME OF WHAT THEY SAW OR WHAT THEY OBSERVED IN THIS STUDY FIRST OF ALL ALL THE GROUPS WERE IN THE WATER OF A GIVEN TEMPERATURE FOR ONE HOUR WHICH IS MUCH LONGER THAN MOST OF THE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE PROTOCALLS THAT ANYONE IS USING AT HOME YOU MAYBE YOU'RE TAKING ONE HOUR LONG COLD SHOWERS MAYBE YOU'RE GETTING INTO THE ICE BATH FOR AN HOUR ALTHOUGH I DON'T RECOMMEND THAT I THINK YOU'D PROBABLY GET BADLY HYPOTHERMIC OR MAYBE YOU'RE GETTING IN TO A COLD WATER IMMERSION FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME BUT I HAVE A HARD TIME IMAGINING THAT IT WOULD BE AN HOUR AND I DON'T SUGGEST THAT IF IT'S VERY COLD SO THIS STUDY FOCUS ON ASHE SOMEWHAT MODERATE LY COOL TEMPERATURES NOT WHAT I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD CONSIDER VERY VERY COLD TEMPERATURES BUT EXTENDED THE DURATION FOR QUITE A WHILE SO AGAIN THIRTY TWO DEGREES SELSIUS TWENTY DEGREES CELSIUS ARE FOURTEEN DEGREES CELSIUS HERE'S WHAT THEY OBSERVED THE GROUP THAT WAS IMMERSED UP TO THE NECK IN THIRTY TWO DEGREES CELSIUS THAT IS EIGHTY NINE DEGREES FARREN HEIGHT WATER DID NOT EXPERIENCE A SHIFT IN METABOLISM NOR A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN DOPOMI NORUP AN EFFREN OR THESE OTHER CATACOLOMINES THE GROUP THAT WAS IN TWENTY DEGREES CELSIUS MEANING SIXTY EIGHT DEGREE FARENHEIT WATER FOR AN HOUR EXPERIENCE A NINETY THREY PER CENT INCREASE IN METABOLIC RATE WHICH IS REMARKABLE GIVEN THAT THE WATER IS IN THAT COLD AND YET AN HOUR IS A PRETTY LONG TIME TO BE IN THERE AND AGAIN IT SPEAKS TO THE DRMATIC EFFECT OF HEAT TRANSFER THAT WATER HAS WHICH I MENTION EARLIER AS SIPPOSE TO BEING OUT IN THE AIR AT SIXTY EIGHT DEGREES IT WOULD IN CERTAINLY NOT CAUSE THAT INCREASE IN METABOLIC RATE THE GROUP THAT WAS AT FOURTEEN DEGREES SELSIUS MEANING FIFTY SEVEN POINT TWO DEGREES FARENHEIT WATER FOR AN HOUR EXPERIENCE A THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PER CENT INCREASE IN METABOLISM SO HUGE INCREASES IN METABOLISM NOW THE MOST INTERESTING DATA TO ME AT LEASE IN TERMS OF MENTAL EFFECTS OF DELIBERATE COLD EXBEISERE WERE THAT THE PLASMA OR SERUM LEVELS OF NORUP IN EFFEREN IN THE BLOOD INCREASED FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY PER CENT THESE ARE HUGE INCREASES IN NORUP IN EFFERAN SO IT SUGGESTS THAT THIS IS A STRESSFUL STIMULUS AT LEAST NOR CHEMICALLY SPEAKING STRESSFUL DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT'S NOT SUPER SUPER COLD ALTHOUGH FIFTY SEVEN POINT TWO DEGREES FARENHEIT FORTEEN DEGREES SELLSIAS IS NOT A YUKNOW IT'S NOT A WARM ENVIRONMENT BUT IT'S NOT A ULTRA ULTRA COLD ENVIRONMENT BUT AN HOUR IS A VERY LONG TIME TO BE IN THERE THE SUBJECTS ALSO EXPERIENCE A TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PER CENT INCREASE IN DOPOMINE CONCENTRATIONS WHICH WHILE NOT FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY PER CENT AS IT WAS WITH NORP AN EFFERENT IS STILL A VERY LARGE INCREASE IN BASE LINE LEVELS OF DOPOMINE AND WHAT WAS INTERESTING IS THAT THOSE INCREASES IN DOPAMINE PERSISTED FOR A VERY LONG PERIOD OF TIME AFTERWARDS EVEN OUT TO TWO HOURS OCAAN THEY THEY STOP THE STUDY AFTER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MINUTES OF GETTING OUT OF THE A COLD BUT NONE THE LESS THESE INCREASES IN NORP ANEFFERENT ARE HUGE AND LONG LASTING AND THESE INCREASES IN DOPOMINE ARE VERY LARGE AND LONG LASTING AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THESE DOCUMENTED EFFECTS IN HUMANS EXPLAIN MUCH OF THE ENHANCEMENT OF ATTENTION AND OF FEELINGS AF WELL BEING IN MOOD THAT PEOPLE TYPICALLY EXPERIENCE AFTER DOING DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE AND THE REASON I SAY THAT IS THAT IF YOU WERE TO GO BACK TO THE EPISODE THAT I DID ON DOPOMINE OR YOU WERE TO GO BACK TO THE EPISODE THAT I DID WITH DOCTOR ONALEMPKI ON A DICTION IN DOPOMINE WHAT YOU WOULD FIND IS THAT INCREASES IN DOPOMINE OF THE SORT EVOKED BY DELIERATE COLD EXPOSURE ARE ACTUALLY VERY SIMILAR TO THE KINDS OF INCREASES IN DOPOMING THAT ARE ELICITED BY THINGS LIKE NICOTINE OR FROM OTHER BEHAVIORS THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE ADDICTIVE AND BAD FOR US BECAUSE THEY LEAD TO OTHER EFFECTS ON THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT WE SIMPLY DON'T WANT AND YET DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE PROVIDED DONE SAFELY CAN CREATE SIMILAR IF NOT GREATER INCREASES IN DOPOMINE THAT ARE NOT JUST FLEETING THAT DON'T JOUST OCCUR DURING SAY THE CONSUMPTION OF SOME DELITERIOUS DRUG OR OR ACTIVITY BUT THAT ARE VERY LONG LASTING AND THAT CAN BE LEVERAGE TOWARD ACTIVITIES OTHER THAN DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE SO I ONT EMPHASIZE THIS IAM NOT SUGGESTING THAT PEOPLE DO DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE FOR AN HOUR A DAY AND UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE NOT MANY STUDIES YET EXPLORING HOW SHORTER COLDER ND TEMPERATURE ENVIRONMENT EXPOSURE SAY ONE MINUTE OR THREE MINUTES OR SIX MINUTES AT YOU KNOW FIFTY FIVE DEGREES OR IT OM FIFTY DEGREES WHETHER NOT THAT LEADS TO SIMILAR GREATER OR REDUCE LEVELS OF DOPOMINE IN THE BRAIN AND BODY AND YET ALMOST EVERYBODY WHO DOES DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE WILL SAY YET IT WAS STRESSFUL I DIDN'T ENJOY IT OR I EVENTUALLY GREW TO LIKE IT BUT THAT I ALWAYS FEEL BETTER AFTERWARDS AND THEN THAT FEELING LASTS A VERY LONG PERIOD OF TIME AND I THINK IT'S ALMOST CERTAIN THAT THOSE EXPERIENCES THAT PEOPLE REPORT RELATE TO THEASE INCREASES IN DOPOMIE AND IN CONCERT WITH THE INCREASES IN NOUREPANEFFERAN ALSO EXPLAIN THE OTHER EFFECT THAT'S COMMONLY REPORTED WHICH IS AN ENHANCEMENT IN MENTAL LACUITY AND THE ABILITY TO FOCUS NOW HERE WE CAN EXTRAPILATE TO THE STUDY THAT I DISCUSSED AT THE EARLY PART OF THE EPISODE WHERE ISTOCKING AT THE USE OF SHORT FIFTEEN MINUTE EXERCISE CAN A MODERATE INTENSY EXERCISE AND HOW THAT WAS SHOWN TO INCREASED LEVELS OF ENERGY AND MENTALACUITY IN THESE WORKING MEMORY OF VISUAL ATTENTION TASK AND THERE AGAIN WE HAVE TO ASSUME SOMEWHAT BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T DOING THEIR CHEMICAL MEASUREMENTS BUT WE CAN REASONABLY ASSUME THAT THOSE IMPROVEMENTS IN COGNIVE PERFORMANCE WERE DUE AT LEAST IN PART TO THE INCREASIN CATACOLAMINES KNOWN TO ACCOMPANI MODERATE INTENSITYES OWN TO CARDIO SO WHAT YOUR STROING TO SEE HERE IS A THEME THE THEME IS THAT VIRTUALLY ANY STIMULUS THAT DELIVERS MORE NOR UPAN FERAN EPANEFFRAN AND DOPOMINE TO OUR SYSTEM WILL SHARPEN OUR MENTAL ACUITY AND ELEVATE OUR MOOD AND WILL DO SO FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE IT TURNS OUT IS A VERY POTENT WAY TO INCREASE THESE CATACOLAMENES THIS CATEGORY OF CHEMICALS AND THEREBY TO INPROVE MOOD MENTILACUITY AND LEVELS OF ALERTNESS AND AS WILL NEXT SEE IT NOT ONLY HAS THAT EFFECT WHICH CAN BE VERY BENEFICIAL FOR MANY PEOPLE AND A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES BUT IT ALSO HAS THE POUSIVE EFFECTS THAT MANY PEOPLE SEEK IN TERMS OF METABOLISM IN LOWERING INFLAMMATION IN THE BODY AND OTHER PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS AS WELL AND FORGIVE ME I WAS ALMOST READY TO MOVE ON TO EFFECTS OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE ON METABOLISM AND INFLAMMATION AND SO FORTH BUT I NEGLECTED TO POINT OUT ONE OF THE OTHER VERY INTERESTING ASPECTS OF THE STUDY SHOWING DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE CAN INCREASE IN OUR PAN EFFERANT AND DOPOMENE WHICH IS THAT THEY OBSERVED NO SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE STRESS HORMON CORTISALL AND THAT IS BOTH SURPRISING INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT THE QUALITY OF STRESS THAT DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE IS CREATING IN THE BODY IS LIKELY TO BE ONE OF WHAT WE CALL USE STRESS HONCELIER THE GREAT PHYSIOLOGIST ONE AN NOBOUT PRIZE FOR DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN DISSTRESS WHICH IS STRESS IN THE BRAIN AND BODY THAT CAUSE IS THE RELEASE OF THINGS LIKE CORTISALL ALONG WITH THE OTHER CATACOLA MEANS AND THAT WE EXPERIENCE AS NEGATIVE HAPPENING TO US AND CAN LEAD TO NEGATIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES AND HE DISTINGUISH THAT FROM USE STRESS WHICH WAS STRESS THAT WE NOW UNDERSTAND IS ASSOCIATE WITH INCREASES IN THINGS LIKE NORUPAN EFRAN AND DOPOMENE BUT NO INCREASES OR MINIMAL INCREASES IN CORTISALL AND THAT CAN LEAD TO POSITIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES SO IT APPEARS THAT DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE CAN CREATE WHAT WE CALL OR WHAT HONCELIE CALLED USE STRESS IN OTHER WORDS IT CAN CREATE A CONDITION IN THE BRAIN AND BODY IN WHICH WE ARE STRESSING OURSELVES WE ARE TRAINING UP RASILIENTS AND YET WE ARE CREATING A NEUROCHEMICAL MIL EU THAT ACTUALLY HAS MANY HEALTH BENEFITS NOW I LIKE TO SHIFT OUR ATTENTION TO THE EFFECTS OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE ON METABOLISM AND ID LIKE TO START BY DETAILING A STUDY THAT WAS PERFORMED ON HUMANS AND PUBLISHD JUST AT THE END OF LAST YEAR THE TITLE OF THE STUDY IS ALTERED BROWN FAT THERMO REGULATION AND INHANCED COLD INDUCED THERMOGENESIS IN YOUNG HEALTHY WINTER SWIMMING MEN AND I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT WHILE THE STUDY WAS ONLY PERFORMED ON MALE SUBJECTS THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK THAT THE EFFECTS THAT THEY DISCOVERED WOULD ONLY PERTAIN TO MEN I WOULD HOPE THAT THEY WOULD ALSO DO A STUDY ON WOMEN AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE BUT THE EFFECTS THAT THEY DESCRIBE ARE VERY BASIC CORE PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESSES WHAT THEY DID IS THEY LOOKED AT DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE IN THIS GROUP OF YOUNG MEN AND THEY USED THAT ELEVEN MINUTE THRESHOLD PER WEAK SO IN OTHER WORDS THEY HAD THEM GET INTO COLD WATER FOR APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN MINUTES PER WEAK AND AGAIN THAT'S ELEVEN MINUTES TOTAL PER WEAK THEY DIVIDED THAT INTO TWO SESSIONS ALTHOUGH IN SPEAKING WITH THE FIRST AUTHOR OF THE STUDY DOCTRO SUSANNISOBERG I LEARNED THAT IT PROBABLY IS NOT IMPORTANT THAT IT BE TWO SESSIONS IT COULD BE THREE OR EVEN FOUR SESSIONS AS LONG AS IT REACHES THAT ELEVEN MINUTE THRESHOLD WHAT THEY DISCOVERED WAS THAT BY GOING INTO THESE COLD ENVIRONMENTS IN THIS CASE COLD WATER IMMERSION UP TO THE NECK FOR ELEVEN MINUTES TOTAL PER WEEK THAT THESE MEN EXPERIENCED INCREASES IN SO CALLED BROWN FAT THERMAGENESIS I'LL TALK MORE ABOUT WHAT THAT IS IN A MOMENT AND INCREASES IN CORPBODY TEMPERATURE THAT TRANSLATE TO INCREASES IN CORES BODY METABOLISM NOW THE OVERALL INCREASES IN CORPBODY METABOLISM THAT THEY EXPERIENCED WERE NOT EXTREMELY LARGE THEY WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT BUT THEY WEREN'T EXTREMELY LARGE HOWEVER THE CHANGES IN BROWN FAT STORES ARE PERHAPS WHAT'S MOST INTERESTING ABOUT THIS STUDY AND IL TELL YOU WHY THE METABOLIC INCREASES OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE ARE BOTH ACUTE MEANING HAPPENING IN THE SHORT TERM WHEN YOU GET INTO THE COLD AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER ONE DOES EXPERIENCE IN INCREASE IN CORES METABOLISM YOU BURN SOME CALORIES AND OTHER WORDS AND WHILE THOSE MIGHT NOT BE VERY SIGNIFICANT INCREASIS OR I SHOULD SAY THEY CAN BE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT BUT THEY ARE NOT ENORMOUS LE LARGE NUMBERS OF CALORIES BURNED THE LONGER LASTING EFFECTS OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE OR METABOLISM SEEM TO TAKE PLACE BY CHANGES THAT OCCUR IN THE TYPES OF FAT THAT WE STORE IN OUR BODY AND THE WAY THAT THAT FAT INPACTS ARE METABOLISM AT OTHER TIMES THROUGHOUT THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR CYCLE THIS ACTUALLY HAS A SOMEWHAT ANECDOTAL BASIS IN PATICULAR IN SCANINAVIA I DON'T SPEAK SWEDISHION WHER I SPEAK DANISH NOR DO I SPEAK NOR WEGIAN BUT I DO HAVE DANISH RELATIVES AND THEY WERE ABLE TO HELP ME DECIPHER A A COMMON SWEDISH SAYING WHICH ESSENTIUALLY TRANSLATES TO THE FACT THAT IN PREPARATION FOR THE SUMMER THEY SAY ONE SHOULD EXPOSE THEMSELVES TO WARM ENVIRONMENTS SO THAT ONE IS COMFORTABLE IN WARM ENVIRONMENTS IN THE SUMMER THAT'S ONE HALF OF THIS TRADITIONAL SWEDISH AND ALSO DANIS SAYING THE OTHER HALF OF THIS TRADITIONAL DANISH SWEDISH SAYING IS THAT IN PREPARATION FOR WINTER IN ORDER TO NOT FEEL TO COLD IN COLD ENVIRONMENTS ONE SHOULD PREPARE FOR THOSE IN THE FALL BY NOT WEARING A JACKET AND EXPOSING ONESELF TO COLD ENVIRONMENTS NOW OF COURSE THIS IS JUST ANECDOTAL CULTURAL LORE BUT IT ACTUALLY HAS A PHYSIOLOGICAL BASIS WHICH IS BY EXPOSING ONESELF TO COLD ENVIRONMENTS ON A REPEATED BASIS IN ANTICIPATION OF EXPOSURE TO MORE EXTREME COLD ENVIRONMENTS ONE CAN FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE IN THOSE EXTREME COLD ENVIRONMENTS AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY OBSERVED IN THIS STUDY BY SOBERGADAL THE MEN FELT MORE COMFORTABLE INEXTREME COLD IF THEY HAD TRAINED THROUGH DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE WHICH MIGHT NOT SEEM SURPRISING AT ALL BUT BASED ON WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER WHEREBY DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE EVOKES THIS DISCOMFORT AND THIS EXPERIENCE OF NOR UP IN EFERAN RELEASE AT LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM THEN YOU WOULD SAY WELL SHOULD THAT DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE ALSO MAKE THEM FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE LIKE THEY REALLY WANT TO GET OUT WELL THAT IS TRUE AT THE BEGINNING OF A DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE PROTOCALL MEANING IN THE FIRST WEEK OR IN THE SECOND WEEK OF THE THIRD WEEK BUT WHAT ONE FINDS IN WHAT YOU WILL FIND IF YOU DO DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE CONSISTENTLY IS THAT YOU WILL THEN BECOME MORE COMFORTABLE AT COLD TEMPERATURES AWAY FROM THE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE SO WHEREAS YOU MIGHT HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN THE PERSON WHO AS ALWAYS COLD IN THE ROOM WITH AIR CONDITIONANG ARE ALWAYS SEEKING A SWEATER ALWAYS WANTING TO BUNDLE UP YOU WILL BE MORE COMFORTABLE IN THOSE COLD ENVIRONMENTS AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS WELL SUBSTANTIATED FROM THIS STUDY END FROM ANIMAL STUDIES WHEREBY DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE CONVERTS ONE PARTICULARE KIND OF FAT CELL THE WHITE FAT CELL WHICH IS A VERY LOW METABOLIC OUTPUT CELL ITS BASICALLY A STORAGE SYTE FOR ENERGY IN THE BODY FAT CELLS TO A DIFFERENTE TYPE OF FAT CELL WHICH IS THE BAGE FAT CELL COLD BAGE BECAUSE ITS ACTUALLY BAGE OR SLIGHTLY BROWN UNDER THE MICROSCOPE OR EVEN TO BROWN FAT CELLS WHICH ARE VERY DARK UNDER THE MICROSCOPE AND DARK BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN MET MITO CONDRIA AND ARE VERY METABOLICALLY AND THERMOGENICALLY ACTIVE IN OTHER WORDS WHITE FAT DOESN'T BURN MANY CALORIES ITS BASICALLY A STORAGE SITE ITS A BANK ACCOUNT FOR ENERGY ITS FILLED WITH LIPIDS AND THOSE LIPIDS CAN BE USED IF THE BODY NEEDS ENERGY AND IF IT GOES INTO A COLORIC DEPISIT BASE FAT AND BROWN FAT ACTS A SORT OF A FURNESS OR THE SORT OF FAT THAT WEU WOULD FIND IN A CANDLE A FUEL THAT CAN INCREASE CORBODY TEMPERATURE SO BASE FAT AND BROWN FAT IS VERY GOOD AT RAISING OUR METABOLISM AND HELPS BURN WHITE FAT NOW OF COURSE IT DOES THAT ONLY IN THE CONTEXT OF A COLORIC DEPHISIT BUT IT CAN ACTUALLY HELP CREATE THAT COLORIC DEPISIT HAVING MORE BASE FAT AND BROWN FAT CAN INCREASE YOUR OVER ALL CORMETABOLISM IN OTHER WORDS THE NUMBER OF CALORIES THAT YOU BURN PER DAY AND THEREFORE THE NUMBER OF CALRIES THAT YOU NEED TO EITHER MAINTAIN OR TO LOSE WEIGHT THE SIMPLE TRANSLATION OF THIS IS THAT GETTING IN TO COLD WATER FOR A TOTAL OF ELEVEN MINUTES PERHAPS MORE BUT AT LEAST ELEVEN MINUTES PER WEAK DIVIDED INTO TWO OR FOR SESSIONS CAN INCREASE YOUR CORMOTABOLISM IN PART BY INCREASING YOUR BAGE AND BROWN FAT STORES AND WE KNOW HOW THAT WORKS AT LEAST IN ANIMAL MODELS AND THERE IS NOW REASON TO SUSPECT THAT THE EXACTSAME MECHANISMS ARE OCCURRING IN UMANTS THE PRIMARY WAY IN WHICH DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE CONVERTS WHITE FAT CELLS INTO THESE MORE METABOLICALLY THERMOGENTICALLY ACTIVE METABOLISM INCREASING BAGE AND BROWN FAT CELLS IS BECAUSE NORAPANEFERON RELEASED WHEN WE GET INTO THE COLD BINDS TO RECEPTORS ON THE SURFACE OF WHITE FAT CELLS AND ACTIVATES DOWNSTREAM PATHWAYS SUCH AS YOU S P ONE  SO THIS IS AN UNCOUPLING PROTINE ONE THAT ACTS ON THE MITA CONDRUAL METABOLISM OF CELLS AND INCREASES THE MITOCHONDREAL OUTPUT OF THOSE CELLS AND THE MITOCHONDRIAL DENSITY OF THOSE CELLS IN OTHER WORDS IT TAKES A CELL THAT HAS A KIND OF A WEAK ENGINE OR NO ENGINE FOR GENERATING ENERGY ALTHOUGH EVERY CELL HAS SOME MITOCHONDRIA IT TAKES CELLS THAT HAVE VERY FUWMITOCHONDRIA AND INCREASES THE ENGINE SIZE AND OF STOKES THE FURNACE OF THOSE PARTICULAR CELLS AND ACTUALLY CAN CHANGE GENE EXPRESSION IN THOSE CELLS THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE CAUSES INCREASES IN NORUP INEFFERON WHICH BIND TO RECEPTORS ON THE SURFACES OF WHITE FAT CELLS WHICH TRIGGERS THE RELEASE OF THINGS LIKE OU C P ONE IT ALSO CAUSES THE RELEASE OF THINGS LIKE P PAR GAMA AND COFACTOR P G C ONE I'M GOINGTO REFER YOU TO A REVIEW IF YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THESE FOR THOSE OF EITHER DON'T WANT TO LEARN MORE ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW IS THAT THE DOWNSTREAM OF ALL THAT ARE INCREASES IN MITOCONDRIA AND METABOLISM AND ACTUAL GENETIC CHANGES IN THE WHITE FAT CELLS THAT CONVERT THEM INTO BAGE AND BROWN FAT CELLS THIS IS A SPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR ADULTS BECAUSE BABIES AND YOUNG CHILDREN ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO SHIVER OR THEY HAVE A LESS ROBUST CAPACITY TO SHIVER VERY SMALL BABIES REALLY CAN'T SHIVER SO THEY HAVE A LOT OF BROWN FAT IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM WARM YOUNG CHILDREN EVENTUALLY DEVELOP THE ABILITY TO SHIVER AND MAINTAIN THESE BROWN FAT STORES MAINLY AROUND THE CLAPHICALS THE HART THE UPPER SPINE AND IN THE UPPER BACK AND IT'S NO COINCIDENCE THAT KIDS CAN OFTEN RUN AROUND WITH A MINAMAL OF CLOTHING AND BE COMFORTABLE IN ENVIRONMENTS THAT ADULTS WOULD BE COLD IN AS LIFE GOES ON WE TEND TO LOSE BASION BROWN FAT BUT THIS MECHANISM THAT I'M REFERRING TO POINTS TO THE PLASTICITY OF WHITE FAT MEANING THE ABILITY FOR WHITE FAT TACTUALY CONVERT ITS IDENTITY INTO THIS METABOLICALLY THERMOGENTICALLY ENHANSING FORM OF BASIAN BROWN FAT SO DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE IS A TERRIFIC WAY TO INCREASE YOUR CORMETABOLISM AND OFTEN TIMES CRITICS WILL SAY WELL THE INCREASE IN METABOLISM ISN'T THAT SIGNIFICANT ALTHOUGH I DO WANT TO POINT OUT AGAIN THE NINETY THREE PER CENT AND THREE HUNDRED FIFTY PER CENT INCREASES I METABOLISM FROM THAT PREVIOUS STUDY BUT CRITICS THEN WILL SAY WELL THAT DOESN'T REALLY TRANSLATE TO THAT BIG OF A COLORIC BURN DURING THE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE BUT TO THAT YOU SHOU O SAY AH BUT THAT'S ONLY LIMITING YOUR OPTICTS TO JUST A PORTION OF THE EFFACTS OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE BECAUSE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE CAN ALSO CONVERT WHITE FAT TO BASE FAT AND BROWN FAT AND LEAD TO THESE MORE LASTING INCREASES IN METABOLISM SO FOR ANY OF YOU INTERESTED IN INCREASING YOUR METABOLISM AND OR BEING COMFORTABLE IN COLD ENVIRONMENTS AND OR BEING COMFORTABLE IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO COMBAT STRASTS MENTALLY DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE I DO BELIEVE AS A POWERFUL TOOL AND THERE IS SIMPLY NO REASON WHY YOU COULDINT AND SHOULDN'T USE THE SAME PROTOCALS THAT IE DESCRIBED EARLY OR FOR BUILDING RASILIENTS TO INCREAE METABOLISM PROVIDED YOU ARE HITTING THAT ELEVEN MINUTE PER WEAK THRESHOLD YOU OUGHT TO BE STIMULATING BOTH MECHANISM INCREASES IN RASILIENTS AND INCREASES IN CORMETABOLISM AS I MENTIONED EARLIER MOST OF THE DETAILED STUDIES ON THE CONVERSION OF WHITE FAT TO BASE FAT AND BROWN FAT THROUGH THE USE OF COLD HAVE BEEN DONE IN ANIMAL MODELS BUT THE HUMAN DATE ARE STARTING TO EMERGE AND IF YOU LIKE TO DO THE DEEP DIVE INTO THESE MECHANISMS THINGS LIKE UC P WAN PEP AR GAMA AT CETERA HERE'S A BEAUTIFUL REVIEW THAT WAS PUBLISHED RECENTLY IN THE JOURNAL CELL WHICH IS ONE OF THE THREE APEXTERNALS NATURE SCIENCE SO AND THE TITLE OF THAT PAPER IS ATOPOST TISSUE PLASTICETY IN HEALTH AND DISEASE I LOVE THIS REVIEU IT HAS BEAUTIFUL DIAGRAMS DETAILING ALL OF THE PATHWAYS FROM COLD TE NOR EP INEFRAN THROUGH U C PAN DOWNSTREAM OF THINGS LIKE CYCLICAM P IF NONE OF THOSE NAMES MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT YOU CERTAINLY DON'T NEED TO KNOW THESE MECHANISMS TO BENEFIT FROM DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE PROTOCALS IF THOSE NAMES DO MEAN SOMETHING TO YOU OR YOU ARE INTERESTED IN EXPLORING THE DOWNSTREAM EFFECTS OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE AND SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S REALLY NICE TITS COVERED IN THIS PAPER IS HOW DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE INTERACTS WITH FASTED STATES AND FED STATES I THINK YOUWILL ALSO FIND THIS REVIEW VERY INTERESTING I DON'T WANT TO GO TO DEEPLY INTO FASTID STATES IN FED STATES RIGHT NOW SUFFICE TO SAY THAT WHEN WE ARE FASTED MEANING WHEN WE HAVE AN ETEN FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME ARE BASE LINE LEVELS OF NOR EP INEFERAN AND EPINEFRAN ARE ALREADY ELEVATED AND SO COLD EXPOSURE AT THOSE TIMES OUGHT TO HAVE AN EVEN GREATER EFFECT ON METABOLISM AND RASILIENTS AND SO ON SO FOR YOU FASTERS OR YOUR INTIMITTEN FASTERS OUT THERE IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GET FANCY YOU CAN DO YOUR DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE WHEN YOU ARE FASTED I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T RECOMMEND DOING IT WITH A VERYFUL STOMACH IN ANY CASE AND AS I MENTION BEFORE ON THIS PODCAST INTERMITTEN FASTING IS BUT ONE WAY AND CERTAINLY THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO LIMIT TOTAL COLORIC IN TAKE FORSAKE OF MAINTAINING OR OR LOSING WEIGHT IF THAT'S YOUR GOAL I KNOW MANY PEOPLE ARE USING AN BENEFIT FROM INTERMITTEN FASTING HOWEVER AND SO IT CERTAINLY CAN BE COMBINED WITH DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE IN ORDER TO GET EVEN GREATER INCREASES IN NOR PIN EFFRON AN EPIN EFFERON SO FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE PRIMARILY INTERESTED IN USING DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE TO INCREASE DOPOMIN LEVELS IN YOUR BRAIN AND BODY YOU CAN ALSO DO A COMBINED PROTOCOL WHEREBY YOU INJEST CAFFINE SIXTY TO A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MINUTES BEFORE THE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE THIS IS BASED ON A STUDY THAT I'AVE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE ENTITLED CAFFINE INCREASES STRIDAL DOPAMINE DETUTY THREE RECEPTR AVAILABILITY IN THE HUMAN BRAIN AND AS THE  TITLES JUSTICE STUDY WAS DONE ON HUMANS LOOKING AT THE DENSITY END OR EFFICACY OF THESE DOPAMINE RECEPTORS IN AN AREA OF THE BRAIN CALLED THE STRATUM WHICH IS INVOLVED IN PLANNING AN ACTION AND ALSO SUPPRESSING PLANNING AN ACTION SINVOLVED A A VERY CLOSELY WITH WHETHER NOT WE CAN ENGAGE IN BEHAVIOR AND WITH HOLD BEHAVIOR THE SO CALLED GO AND NO GO PATHWAYS IN THE BRAIN DOPAMINE PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN THAT AND MANY OTHER THINGS AS WELL AS A YOU NOW KNOW SO WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO INGEST CAFFINE SIXTY TO A HUNDRED TWENTY MINUTES BEFORE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE WELL SO TALKS ABOUT EARLIER DOPAMINE CAN INCREASE QUITE SUBSTANTIALLY IN RESPONSE TO DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE BUT DOPAOMINE ON ITS OWN DOESN'T DO ANYTHING T HAS TO BIND TO RECEPTORS AND THIS PAPER SHOWS QUITE DEFINITIVELY THAT INJESTING KAFFINE IN THIS CASE IT WAS THREE HUNDRED MELEGRAM DOSE OF CAFFINE WHICH IS A BOW THE DOSE OF CAFFINE IN TWO OR THREE CUPS OF COFFEEAT DEPENDS ON THE STRENGTH OF THE COFFEE OF COURSE BUT IT'S NOT AN OUTRAGEOUS AMOUNT OF KAFFINE THAT INCREASES THE DENSITY AND OUR EFFICACY OF THESE RECEPTORS WHICH YOUOULD ALLOW THAT DOPAMINE TO HAVE ITS GREATEST EFFECT AND FOR THOSE WHO YOU THAT WHEN I GET REALLY REALY FANCY I SUPPOSE YOU COULD DO THIS FASTED SO YOU GET THE FURTHER INCREASE IN ORAPANEFRAN THEN YOU GET THE DOPAMINE INCREASE FROM THE COLD EXPOSURE THE BIND THE DOPAMINE ALTHOUGH I DO ON A POINT OUT THAT AT SOME POINT YOU START LAYERING TOGETHER ENOUGH PROTOCOLS THAT YOU WOULD BE SPENDING YOUR ENTIRE DAY TRYING TO GET THIS DOPAMINE PULSE AND I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU HAD WOULD HAVE OTHER ACTIVITIES TAT YOU WOULD ENGAGE IN BUT IF YOU'RE ETTING UP IN THE MORNING AND YOUR FASTED BECAUSE YOU HAVE AN EATEN ALL NIGHT AND YOU HAVE A CUP OF COFFE AND THEN SIXTY MINUTES LATER YOU TAKE YOUR COLD SHOWER OR TO HOURS LATER YOU DO YOUR COLD IMERSION AR YOUE CALLD SHOWER YOU WOULD BE LAYRN TOGETHER THESE DIFFERENT MECHANISMS OF DOPAMINE RECEPTORS EPANEFPERAN AND SO FORTH IN A WAY THAT AT LEAST TO ME DOESN'T SEIM OF INCOMPATIBLE WITH HAVING SOME OTHER LIFE LIKE GOING O SCHOOL IN HAVING RELATIONSHIPS ET CETERA AND THIS INCREASE IN DOPAMINE PARTICULARLY IN THE STRIATUM IS NOT A TRIVIAL ONE I DO ON A POINT OUT AS THE AUTHORS DO THAT PRECLINICAL STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT INCREASES IN STRIDAL DOPAMINE INDUCED BY THINGS LIKE MODAFPHINOM WHICH IS USED TO TREAT EIGHTY EIGHTY AND A TREAT NARCALEPSY IS NECESSARY FOR THEIR WAKE PROMOTING ACTIONS WHAT THIS REALLY SAYS IS THAT JUST HEAVING ELEVATED LEVELS OF DOPAMINE FROM A DROG OR FROM AN ICE BATH OR WHAT HAVE YOU IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO GET THE EFFECTS OF DOPAOMINE YOU REALLY NEED THE RECEPTORS TO BE AVAILABLE AND YOU NEED THOSE RECEPTORS TO BE AVAILABLE IN THE APPROPRIATE DENSITY AND YOU NEED THOSE RECEPTORSTO BE AVAILABLE IN THE APPROPRIATE DENSY IN THE STRIATUM IN PARTICULAR SO I THNK THERE ARE NUMBER OF REASONS WHY IF IT'S COMPATIBLE WITH THE OTHER ASPECTS OF YOUR HEALTH CAUSE OF COURSE ALWAYS YOU HAVE OT CONSIDER THIS ON A BACKGROUND OF CART OFASCULAR HEALTH AND BLOOD PRESSURE ET CETERA THAT IN JESTING A CUPPER TUE OF COFFEE AN HOUR BEFORE YOUR ICE BATH MAY BE FASTED AS WELL COULD BE QUITE BENEFICIAL FOR INCREASING DOPOMINE OVER QUITE EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME A COUPLE OF KEY POINTS THAT YOU'LL WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO IN THINKING ABOUT DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE AND METABOLISM IN THE SOBERD STUDY THEY ALSO EXPLORED THE USE OF SANA AND HOW TO USE SANA MEANING DELIBERATE HEAT IN CONJUNCTION WITH COLD WE ARE GOING TO DO AN ENTIRE EPISODE ABOUT THE USE OF HEAT FOR HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE SO THAT IS NOT THE FOCUS NOW HOWEVER IT DOES RAISE AN IMPORTANT POINT THAT WE DO NY TO ADDRESS AT THIS MOMENT WHICH IS IF YOU ARE USING SANA OR IF YOU ARE TAKING WARM SHOWERS OR IF YOU ARE SIMPLY USING DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE OF ANY KIND SHOULD YOU GET INTO THE HEAT AFTERWARD OR BEFORE OR NOT AT ALL AND THIS IS WHERE WE CAN POINT TO THE SO CALLED SOBERD PRINCIPLE LEAST I CALL IT THE SOBERD PRINCIPLE THE SOBER PRINCIPLE NAMED AFTER A FIRST AUTHOR OF THIS STUDY I REFER TO EARLIER DOCTOR SUSANNA SOBERD IN SCIENCE IT IS APPROPRIATE TO TAKE A KEYPIECE OF DATA AND CALL IT A PRINCIPLE IF IN FACT IT TRANSLATES TO SOMETHING LARGER WHICH I BELIEVE IT DOES IT IS GENERALLY NOT APPROPRIATE FOR PEOPLE TO NAME OF PRINCIPLE AFTER THEMSELVES THOUGH THERE ARE FOU SCIENTISTS THAT HAVE DONE THAT SO I HAVE NAMED AT THE SOBERED PRINCIPLE BUT I DID THAT TO GIVE IT APPROPRIATE CREDIT TO DOCTOR SUSANNA SOBER WHO DISCOVERED THAT AND POINT IT OUT QUITE APPROPRIATELY THAT TO ACHIEVE THE GREATEST INCREASES IN METABOLISM THROUGH DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE YOU WANT TO FORCE YOURSELF TO REHEAT ON YOUR OWN AFTER THE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE MEANING YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO GO FROM THE COLD SHOWER TO A HOT SHOWER OR FROM THE COLD SHOWER TO A SANA RATHER IF YOU ARE GOING TO START WITH A HOT SHOWER OR YOU GOING TO START WITH A SANA THAT YOU WOULD END WITH THE COLD AND THEN YOU WOULD REHEAT NATURALLY NOW I PERCSONALLY TAKE A COLD SHOWER IF YOU TIMES A WEAK OR DO COLD IMMERSION AND BECAUSE I AM NOT SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON INCREASING METABOLISM ALTHOUGH I PROBABLY SHOULD BE THAT'S NOT WHAT AMUSING IT FOR NOW I WILL TAKE A HOT SHOWER AFTERWARDS AND IN DOING SO I AM SHORT CIRCUITING SOME OF THE FURTHER METABOLIC INCREASES THAT I WOULD ACHIEVE WERE I TO JUST END WITH THE COLD SO THE SOBERED PRINCIPLE IS IF YOU WANT TO INCREASE YOUR METABOLISM END WITH COLD AND WE CAN TAKE THIS A STEP FURTHER AND SAY THAT IF YOU WANT TO USE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE TO INCREASE METABOLISM THAT YOU SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU SHIVER AND THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT THERE ARE A SERIES OF STUDIES BUT IN PARTICULAR ONE STUDY PUBLISH IN THE JOURNAL NATURE EXCELLENT JOURNAL IN THE YOUR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SHOWING THAT DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE THAT EVOKES SHIVERING FROM THE MUSCLES CAUSES THE RELEASE OF A MOLECULE CALLED SUCCANATE FROM THE MUSCLES AND THAT SUCK ANATE PLAYS A KEY ROLL IN ACTIVATING BROWN FAT THORMAGENESIS WHICH YOU NOW HAVE HEARD ABOUT AND UNDERSTAND AS CRITICAL TO THE INCREASES IN METABOLISM CAUSED BY DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE SO WHAT THIS MEANS IS IF YOU ONT INCREASE YOUR METABOLISM END ON COLD THAT'S THE SOBERD PRINCIPLE AND AS BEST YOU CAN TRY AND GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU ARE SHIVERING EITHER WHEN YOU ARE IN THE COLD EXPOSURE OR IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS NOW ONE EFFICIENT WAY TO DO THIS IS TO FOR INSTANCE YOU COULD GET INTO THE COLD SHOWER FOR A MINUTE OR TWO MINUTES OR THREE MINUTES UNCOMFORTABLY COLD BUT SAFE TO STAY IN REMEMBER THAT'S OUR GENERAL RULE OF THUM THEN TURN OFF THE WATER AND STAND THERE MAKE SURE THAT YOUR NOT HOLDING YOURSELF CLOSE TO YOUR BODY YOU'RE NOT HUGGING YOURSELF TO TRY AND KEEP YOURSELF WARM BUT RATHER YOUR LIMBS ARE EXTENDED AT YOUR SIDES AND THEN IF THAT FAILS TO INDUCE SHIVER THAN TO TURN ON THE COLD WATER AGAIN AND THEN TURN IT OFF AGAIN SO ALTERNATING PERHAPS A MINUTE TO THREE MINUTES OF COLD EXPOSURE FOLLOWED BY A MINUTE TO THREE MINUTES OF DRYWING OUT IN AIR AND GOING BACK INTO THE COLD EXPOSURE ET CETERA I CAN TELL YOU THIS FROM EXPERIENCE THIS IS A PRETTY BRUTAL PROTOCOL IF YOU HAVE NEVER TRIED GETTING INTO AN ICE BATH OR COLD WATER IMMERSION OR COLD SHOWER FOR ONE MINUTE AND THEN GETTING OUT AND TRYN TO XTAND THERE WITH YOUR ARMS EXTENDED IN COOL OR COLD AIR FOR ONE MINUTE AND THEN GETTING BACK INTO THE COLD SHOWER OR WATER IMMERSION YOU ARE IN FOR AN EXPERIENCE BECAUSE EVEN FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE PRETTY SHIVER RESISTANT YOU WILL FIND THAT IT IS MUCH MUCH HARDER TO GET OUT OF THAT COLD WATER AND STAND THEIR ARMS EXTENDED AND DRAWING OFF BY EVAPORATION WHICH FURTHER DRAWS HEAT FROM THE BODY THEN IT IS TO WRAP YOURSELF IN A TOWEL GET IN A WARM SHOWER OR AFSONA SO THERE CERTAINLY NO REQUIREMENT TO END ON COLD THERE CERTAINLY NO REQUIREMENT TO INDUCE SHIVER BUT IF YOUR PRIMARY GOAL IS TO INDUCE INCREASES IN METABOLISM BOTH IN THE SHORT TERM AND IN THE LONG TERM FOLLOWING THE COLD EXPOSURE WILL THEN YOU'LL WANT END ON COLD AND YOU'LL OUGHTWANT TO FIND AWAY TO SHIVER PROVIDED THAT THE LEVEL OF COLD THAT YOUR EPOSING YOURSELF TO IS STILL SAFE FOR YOU OVER ALL SO UP UNTIL NOW IAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE AS A POTENT STIMULUS FOR THE RELEASE OF NORUP IN EFFRON IN THE BRAIN AND BODY AND INDEED IT IS BUT THE WAY OF BEEN DESCRIBING IT HAS BEEN IN THE CONTEXT OF CIRCULATING PLASMA LEVELS OF NOR UP AN EFFERN MEANING CIRCULATING WITHIN THE BLOOD WHAT I HAVEN'T MENTIONE BUT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE IS THAT THE FAT SELLS THEMSELVES ACTUALLY RECEIVE IN PUT FROM NURONS SO THERE ARE NURONS THAT RELEASE NOR APINEFERAN IN RESPONSE TO COLD DIRECTLY INTO THE FAT SO I WANT TO GIVE YOU THIS PICTURE OF HOW THE ARCHITECTURE OF ALL THIS WORKS BECAUSE I THINK IT CAN HELP YOU NAVIGATE AND INDEED BUILD BETTER DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE PROTOCOLS YOUR DRENAL GLANS RELEASE NOR UPINEFERAN AN EPINEFERON YOUR BRAIN HAS SIGHTS WITHIN IT LIKE THE LOCUST SERULIUS THAT RELEASE NOR UPINEFERAN AN EPINEFERON BUT THERE ARE ALSO NURONS WITHIN YOUR SKIN THAT SENSE COLD AND OTHER NURONS THAT CAN DIRECTLY RELEASE NOR UPIN FERAN INTO TE FAT STORES AND CAUSE THOSE WHITE FAT CELLS TO CONVERT TO BASIAN BROWN FAT AND I THINK THIS PARTICULAR ASPECT OF OUR PHYSIOLOGY IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED IN STUDIES AND WHEN PEOPLE SAY OH WHILE THE INCREASES IN METABOLISM AREN'T THAT GREAT THE CIRCULATING LEVELS OF NOR UPINEFFERAND THOSE ARE VERY LARGE BUT THEIRE VERY TRANSIENT AND SO ON THAT FAILS TO UNDERSTAND THAT NURONS THAT ACTUALLY SENSE COLD ARE IN A POSITION TO COMMUNICATE VILE OTHER NURONS DIRECTLY TO THE FAT CELLS AND RELEASE NOR UPIN EFFERENT INTO THOSE FATCELLS WHICH AS I POINTED OUT EARLIER SET OFF A HUGE SET OF IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERN CASCADES OF EVEN GENA EXPRESSION CHANGES SO THE PICTURE THAT I'D LIKE YOU TO HAVE IN YOUR MIND IS THAT WHEN YOU GET INTO THE COLD YES OF COURSE YOU EXPERIENCE THAT AS A EXPERIENCE OF I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS I'M GOING TO OVERCOME THIS I'M GOAN TO CLIMB OVER THESE MENTAL WALLS THAT REPRESENT A DRENALINE RELEASE IN MY BRAIN AND BODY BUT ALSO THAT YOUR FAT SELLS ARE RECEIVING SIGNALS NOR UP AN EFFERAN SIGNALS THAT ARE CHANGING THOSE FAT ELLS AN THE WAY THAT THEY METABOLIZE ENERGY NOW ID LIKE TO SHIFT OUR ATTENTION TO THE USE OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE FORSAKE OF PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE AND THERE ARE LOT OF OPINIONS OUT THERE ABOUT THE USE OF DELIBERATE COLD WHETHER NOT IT SHOULD BE DONE FOR INSTANCE BEFORE OR AFTER EXERCISE WHETHER R NOT IF DONE IMMEDIATELY AFTER STRENGTH TRAINING OR HYPERTROPHE TRAINING MEANING TRAINING DESIGN TO GROW MUSCLES OR MAKE THEM STRONGER WHETHER NOT IT CAN INHIBIT THAT PROCESS AND SO ON AND SO FORTH I THINK TO DAY IN LOOKING OVER THE LITERATURE AND TRYING TO BRING FORWARD THE SIMPLIST AND MOST STRAIGHT FORWARD AND YET SCIENTIFICALLY GROUNDED PROTOCALLS WE CAN SET UP SOME GENERAL GUIDE LINES THAT WILL ALLOW MOST IF NOT ALL OF YOU TO STILL EXTRACT THE BENEFITS OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE ON PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE WITHOUT GETTING TWO NEURODIC ABOUT THE EXACT TIMING BUT FORSAKE OF DISCUSSION AND BECAUSE IT'S A PROMINENT THEME IN MANY ONLINE COMMUNITIES LET'S JUS START WITH THE BIG ONE OUT THERE MEANING THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT DOING AN ICE BATH OR DOING DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE OR TAKING A COLD SHOWER AFTER STRENGTH SLASH HYPERTROPHE TRAINING MEANING TRAINING DESIGN TO INCREASE STRENGTH OR AND OR I SHOULD SAY THE SIZE OF MUSCLES WILL SOMEHOW SHORT CIRCUIT OR DIMINISH THAT PROCESS WHETHER NOT IT WIL REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THOSE STRENGTH GAINS AND HYPERTROPHE GAINS AND THE SHORT ANSWER THAT I WAS ABLE TO ARRIVE AT ON THE BASIS OF A REVIEW ARTICLE THAT'LL TALK ABOUT IN A MOMENT AND SOME OTHER STUDIES AS WELL IS THAT IF YOUR MAIN GOAL IS HYPERTROPHY AND STRENGTH IT IS PROBABLY BAST TO AVOID COLD WATER IMMERSION AND ICE BATH AND M ERSION IN THE FOUR HOURS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THAT STRENGTH AND OR HYPERTROPHY TRAINING AGAIN IF YOUR MAIN GOAL IS TO ACHIEVE HYPERTROPHY OR STRENGTH OR SOME COMMINATION OF THOSE PROBABLY BEST TO AVOID COLD WATER IMMERSION UP TO THE NECK OR ICE BATH IMMERSION UP TO THE NECK IMMEDIATELY AFTER STRENGTH AN HYPERTROPHY TRAINING AND EXTENDING OUT TO ABOUT FOUR HOURS AFTER THAT TRAINING IF YOURE REALLY NEURADIC ABOUT THIS THAN PERHAPS YOU'D WANT O MOVE THE COLD WATER EXPOSURE TO A DIFFERENT DAY ENTIRELY BUT IT ALL DEPENDS ON HOW NAURADICALLY ATTACHED YOU ARE TO GETTING EVERY LAST BIT OF STRENGTH AN HYPERTROPHY AND IF THAT'S YOUR GOAL TURRIFIC WELL THEN PROBABLY MOVING THE COLD EXPOSURE FOUR HOURS OR MORE AWAY FROM THAT TRAINING IS GOING TO BE NECESSARY FOR YOU NOW YOU'LL NOTICE I DID NOT TALK ABOUT COLD SHOWERS AND THE REASON I DID NOT TALK ABOUT COLD SHOWERS IS THAT THERE SIMPLY ARE NOT VERY MANY STUDIES OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE THROUGH COLD SHOWERS FOR THE REASONS I TALKED ABOUT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE IT'S HARD FOR ME TO IMAGIN THAT TAKING A BRIEF COLD SHOWER AFTER A STRENGTH OR HYPERTROPHY TRAINING SESSION WOULD COMPLETELY REVERSE OR SHORT CIRCUIT THE EFFECTS OF THAT STRENGTH AND HYPERTROPHY TRAINING BUT AGAIN IF YOUR NAURADICALLY ATTACHED TO GETTING EVERY LAST BIT OF STRENGTH IN HYPERTROPHY OUT OF YOUR TRAINING SESSIONS THEN BY ALL MEANS ERE ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION AND WAIT FOUR HOURS OR MORE TO DO YOUR COLD SHOWER JUST AS YOU WOULD WEIHT FOUR HOURS OR MORE TO DO YOUR COLD WATER IMMERSION NOW THERE ARE NICE DATA POINT INTO THE FACED THAT DOING COLD WATER IMMERSION AFTER A HARD RUN SO ENDURANCE TRAINING OR EVEN SPRENT AN INTERVAL TRAINING OR AFTER A WEIGHT WORK OUT WHERE YOUR MAIN FOCUS IS ON PERFORMANCE OF THOSE MOVEMENTS OR AFTER A SKILL TRAINING WORK OUT WHERE YOUR MAIN FOCAS ON PERFORMANCE OF THOSE MOVEMENTS THAT THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK THAT THAT COLD WATER IMMERSION OR ICE BATH OR COLD SHOWER WOULD INHIBIT THE PROGRESS OR THE STIMULUS THAT WOULD LEAD TO PROGRESS THAT OCCURR DURING THAT TRAINING SESSION IN OTHER WORDS I DON'T SEE ANY REASON BASED ON THE LITERATURE TO AVOID DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE IMMEDIATELY AFTER TRAINING AGAIN UNLESS YOUR GOAL IS HYPERTROPHY AND STRENGTH AND IN FACT THERE'S A VERY NICE REVIEW THAT WAS RECENTLY PUBLISHED ON DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE AND HOW IT CAN IMPACT PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE WHETHER NOT IT'S DONE BE FOUR OR AFTER DIFFERENTYPES OF TRAINING AND SO FORTH THE PAPER IS ENTITLED IMPACT OF COLD WATER IMMERSION COMPARED WITH PASSIVE RECOVERY FOLLOWING A SINGLE BOUT OF STRENUOUS EXERCISE ON ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE IN PHYSICALLY ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WITH META ANALYSIS AND META REGRESSION SO THIS IS A META ANALYSIS OF FIFTY TWO STUDIES THAT LOOKED AT A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF VARIABLES AND CONTECT AS YOU WOULD EXPECT IN AMETANALYSIS OF FIFTY TWO STUDIES I'M GOING TO READ YOU THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE STUDY AND I WILL PROVIDE A LINK WE CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO GO THROUGH LL THE DETAILS OF THE STUDY I WILL HIGHLIGHT A FEW SPECIFIC OUTCOMES THAT I FOUND PARTICULARLY INTERESTING BUT HERE I AM PARIPHRASING THEIR CONCLUSIONS THAT COLD WATER IMMERSION I WANT IT EMPHASIZE IMMERSION NOT COLDCHOWERS BUT COLD WATER IMMERSION THEY SAY WAS AN EFFECTIVE RECOVERY TO AFTER HIGH INTENSITY EXERCISE THEY OBSERVED POSITIVE OUTCOMES MEANING IMPROVEMENTS IN CERTAIN VARIABLES FOR MUSCULAR POWER MUSCULAR SORENESS MEANING REDUCE MUSCULAR SORNESS INCREASE MUSCULAR POWER PERCEIVED RECOVERY AFTER TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF EXERCISE HOWEVER THERE WERE CERTAIN FORMS OF EXERCISE THAT WERE NOT BENEFITED BY COLD WATER IMMERSION SUCH AS ECENTRIC EXERCISE EXERCISE FOCASSING ONLY ON THE LOWERING COMPONENT OR THE SO CALLED ECENTRIC COMPONENT OF RESISTANCE EXERCISE THEY SAW SOME VERY INTERESTING DOSE RESPONSE RELATIONSHIPS FOR THINGS LIKE IN DURANCE TRAINING MEANING THE LONGER THE COLD EXPOSURE POST ENDURANCE TRAINING THE MORE IMPROVEMENT IN ENDURANCE PERFORMANCE REDUCTIONS IN CIRCULATING CRETING CINASES AND THINGS THAT RELATE TO MUSCLE DAMAGE UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE BY THE WAY WILL DO AN ENTIRE EPISODE ON CREATING IN CREATING KINASES WHICH ARE IMPORTANT EXERSE FOR MUSCULAR FUNCTION BUT ALSO FOR BRAIN FUNCTION BUT THE BASIC TAKE AWAY WAS THAT COLD WATER IMMERSION PERFORMED AFTER HIGH INTENSITY EXERCISE WAS BENEFICIAL FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT STANDPOINTS AND INDICATED THAT SHORTER DURATION COLD EXPOSURE AND LOWER TEMPERATURES CAN IMPROVE THE EFFICACY OF COLD WATER EXPOSURE IF USED AFTER HIGH INTENSITY EXERCISE  THERE AREM DIRECTLY PULLING FROM THEIR CONCLUSIONS SO WHAT THE SAYS IS THAT ITS NOT JUST THOSE LONGER DURATION THIRTY FORTY FIVE MINUTE AND SIXTY MINUTE PROTOCALLS OF COLD WATER IMERSION THAT WE DISCUSSED EARLIER BUT ALSO SHORTER DURATION ONE MINUTE THREE MINUTE FIVE MINUTE EXPOSURES TO LOWER TEMPERATURES TEMPERATURES THAT WOULD MAKE YOU SYCHOLOGICALLY WANT TO GET OUT AS SOON AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN BUT AGAIN THAT YOU CAN SAFELY STAY IN DONE AFTER TRAINING REALLY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES IN TERMS OF REDUCING SORENESS AND IMPROVING TRAINING EFFICACY MEANING YOUR ABILITY TO GET BACK INTO TRAINING MORE QUICKLY AND THEREBY DELIVER MORE TRAINING STIMULLE TO A GIVEN MUSCLE OR IN YOUR ENDURANCE TRAINING PROTOCOL TRANSLATE ENGLISH WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT TAKING A COLD SHOWER OR GETTING INTO AN ICE BATH OR SOME OTHER FORM OF COLD WATER IMMERSION WITHIN THE IMMEDIATE MINUTES OR EVEN THE MEDIATE HOURS FALLING YOUR TRAINING HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE BENEFICIAL I AM SURE IN A NUMBER OF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS FOR INSTANCE HOW LONG SHOULD YOU BE IN THAT COLD EXPOSURE IS IT THE SAME AS THE ELEVEN MINUTE THRESHOLD DESCRIBED EARLIER TO BE ONUST WITH YOU THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH STUDIES TO REALLY POINT TO THE CRITICAL THRESHOLD FOR ELIMINATING OR REDUCING TO LAID ON SET MUSCLESORNE S OR FORGETTING MAXIMAL RESULTS FROM POWER AND ENDURANCE TRAINING BUT THIS STUDY DOES MAKE A COUPLE OF KEY POINTS AND HERE I WILL JUST PARAPHRASE FOR INSTANCE THAT COLD WATER IMMERSION IS MORE LIKELY TO POSITIVELY INFLUENCE MUSCULAR POWER PERFORMANCE TO REDUCE MUSCLE SORENESS TO REDUCE SYRUM CREEDSEEN CINES AND TO IMPROVE PERCEIVED RECOVERY AFTER HIGH INTENSITY EXERCISE AS COMPARED WITH PASSIVE RECOVERY THIS CAN BE TRANSLATED TO COLD WATER EXPOSURE AFTER TRAINING IS BENEFICIAL AND PROBABLY BETTER THAN PASSIVE RECOVERY FROM A NUMBER OF STANDPOINTS IN ADDITION THEY SAY THAT DOSE RESPONSE RELATIONSHIPS MEANING THE AMOUNT AND THE DEGREE OF COLD THAT PEOPLE ARE EXPOSED TO AND HOW OFTEN THEY DID THAT IN PARTICULAR IN LOWER TEMPERATURE COLD IMERSION SO THESE WOULD BE THE SORTS OF COLD IMMERSION PROTOCALS THAT ARE ONE MINUTE OR TWO MINUTES THREE MINUTES MAY BE FIVE MINUTES BUT THAT ONE COULDN'T STAY IN THEIR LONGER BECAUSE IT FEELS STRESSFUL AND ONE WANTS TO GET OUT MAY BE MORE EFFECTIVE AFTER HIGH INTENSITY EXERCISE FOR REMOVAL OF SYRUM CREATINE CINASE AS WELL THAT THESE SHORTER DURATION COLD WATER IMMERSION APPROACHES MAY BE MORE EFFECTIVE AFTER HIGH INTENSITY INDURANCE PERFORMANCE AS WELL SO ALL THIS CAN BE TRANSLATED TO SAY THAT UNLESS YOUR MAIN GOAL IS HYPERTROPHE AND STRAINTH THAT COLD EXPOSURE IDEALLY COLD IMMERSION IN COLD WATER ICE PATH BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT THAN COLD SHOWERS IS LIKELY GOING TO BE BENEFICIAL IF DONE IMMEDIATELY AFTER OR IN THE MINUTES OR HOURS AFTER YOUR TRAINING ESPECIALLY HIGH INTENSITY TRAINING ONE PARTICULARLY NICE THING ABOUT THIS METANALYSIS IS THAT IN INCLUDED SOME STUDIES THAT INVOLVE THE USE OF COOLING PACKS SO AGAIND VEST THAT CAN HOLD ESSENTIALLY ICE PACKS ON AND INDEED EVEN CRIO THERAPE CHAMBERS AND SO ON THERE'S A NICE TABLE IN THE STUDY IF YOU WANT TO GET REALLY DETAIL THAN GO AND LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT THOSE STUDIES I INVITE YOU TO DO THAT WILL PUT A LINK TO THIS STUDY IN THE CAPTION FOR THIS EPISODE BUT ALL IN ALL WHAT THIS STUDY SHOWS IS THAT DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE CAN BE VERY USEFUL FOR RECOVERY LIKELY THROUGH REDUCTIONS IN INFLAMMATION IN MUSCLE AND CONNECTIVE TISSUE AND WHILE THIS STUDY DID NOT LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT THE MECHANISMS AVE REDUCED INFLAMMATION CAUSED BY DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE THOSE MECHANISMS ARE SOMEWHAT KNOWN THERE ARE NUMBER OF STUDIES THAT HAVE POINTED THE FACT THAT DELIBERATE COLD IN COLD GENERALLY CAN REDUCE IN FLAMMATORY SIDOCINES SUCH AS ILE SIX INTER LUCANSIX IT CAN INCREASE ANTI INFLAMMATORY SIDEOKIND SUCH AS INTERLUCANTEN AND SO ON WITHOUT GETTING INTO AL THOSE DETAILS I THINK ITS SUFFICIENT TO SAY THAT IF YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO EXPERIENCES A LOT OF DELAYED ON SET MUSCLE SORENESS TAKING A COLD SHOWER AFTER YOUR TRAINING OR GETTING INTO A COLD IMMERSION AFTER YOUR TRAINING EVEN IF ITS A FEW HOURS LATER OUGHT TO HELP AND IF YOU ERE DOING PARTICULARLY INTENSE TRAINING THAN YOU PROBABLY WANT O RATCHET UP THE NUMBER OF COLD EXPOSURE SESSIONS THAT YOUR DOING EVEN IF THOSE HAVE TO BE DONE ON SEPARATE DAYS FROM YOUR TRAINING BECAUSE A LOT OF THE INFLAMMATORY EFFECTS OF TRAINING ENDURANCE AND STRAINGTRANING ACTUALLY OCCURRING SOME HOURS AWAY FROM THE TRAINING STIMULUS SO IT'S NOT JOUS THAT INFLAMMATION GOES UP RADICALLY DURING TRAININ WHICH IT OFTEN CAN BUT THAT IT CAN OCCUR EVEN IN THE DAYS AND EVEN WEEKS AFTERWARDS DEPENDING ON HOW INTENSE AND HOW LONG DURATION THAT TRAININIS SO DELIVERCOLLED EXPOSURE IS VERY POWERFUL AS AN ANTI INFLAMMATORY TOO NOW I LIKE TO EMPHASISE THE TOPIC THAT WE TOUCHED ON AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE WHICH ARE THOSE GLABYRAS SKIN SURFACES THE HANDS THE UPPER FACE IN THE BOOMS OF THE FEET THROUGH WHICH HEAT IS ESPECIALLY GOOD AT LEAVING THE BODY AND ANOTHER WAY OF PUTTING THAT IS THAT ONE CAN COOL THE BODY MUCH MORE EFFICIENTLY THROUGH THE GLABYRA SKIN SURFACES NOW IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND ALL OF THE SCIENCE BEHIND THIS AND ALL OF THE VARIOUS APPLICATIONS I INVITE YOU TO PLEASE LISTEN TO THE EPISODE THAT I DID WITH DOCTOR CRAIG HELLER AGAIN IN THE BIOLOGY DEPARTMENT AT STAMFORD FOR SAKE OF THIS EPISODE I AM JUST GOIN A DETAIL A COUPLE OF FINDINGS FROM HIS LABORATORY THE FIRST ONE DEALING WITH EXERCISE IN DUCE HYPEROTHERMIA BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS VERY INTERESTING AND IT CAN EVEN SAVE LIVES IF YOU UNDERSTAND THE WAY THIS WORKS THERE'S A PARTICULAR PAPER THAT FOCUS IS ON THIS AAND THAT WE WILL PUT A LINK TO THIS AS WELL THE TITLEF THIS PAPER IS NOVEL APPLICATION OF CHEMICAL COL PACKS FOR TREATMENT OF EXERCISE IN DUCE HYPROTHERMIA A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL THIS IS A PRETTY BRUTAL STUDY A BRUTAL FOR THE SUBJECTS THAT IS WHAT THE STUDY INVOLVED US HAVING SUBJECTS WALK ON A TREAD MILL AT A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT INCLINE ANYWHERE FROM NINE TO SEVENTEEN PER CENT WEARING A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF CLOTHING THAT WAS NOT WELL VENTILATED AND THE ROOM WAS KEPT TO FORTY DEGREES SELSIUS WHICH IS A HUNDRED AND FOUR DEGREES FARENHITE THIS IS DEFINITLY NOT SOMETHING TO DO AT HOME THE STUDY WAS DESIGN TO INDUCE HYPEROTHERMIA WHICH AS I MENTION EARLIER CAN BE QUITE DANGEROUS AND THEY COMPARED TWO TYPES OF COOLING IN THE FIRST FORM OF COOLING THAT THEY CALL TRADITIONAL COOLING THEY HAD ICE PACKS ON THEIRE NECK IN THEIR ARM PITS AND IN THEIR GROWING AND IN THE OTHER GROUP THERE WAS THE SO CALLED GLABYRAS SKIN COOLING SO THE PALMS THE SOULES OF THE FEET WHICH RATRY THAT SO THEY WERE COOLING INSIDE THE BOOTS A OR INSIDE OF GLOVES AND ON THE UPPER PORTION OF THE FACE AND THE BASIC TAKE AWAY OF THE STUDY IS THAT BY COOLING THE GLABYRAS SKIN THE SUBJECTS WERE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THIS WALKING ON THESE INCLINED TREAD MILLS FOR MUCH LONGER THEN WERE THE PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE TRADITIONAL COOLING AND ALSO THE RETURN TO BASELINE TEMPERATURE WAS MUCH FASTER IN THE GLABYRAS SKIN COOLING GROUP SO HOW THIS TRANSLATES TO THE REAL WORLD IS THAT IF EVER YOU ARE HYPEROTHERMIC OR SOME ONE ELSE'S HYPEROTHERMIC ONE WAY TO COOL THEM DOWN QUICKLY IS TO COOL THESE PALMER GLABYRUS SOLS OF THE FEET GLABYRUS AND UPPER PORTION OF THE FACE GLABYRUS PORTIONS OF THE BODY USING COOL RAGS USING ICE PACKS OR USING ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT O COLD OBJECTS ARE TEMPERATURES ONE KEY THING IF YOU RE GOING TO USE GLABYRUS SKIN COOLING IS THAT WHATEVER YOU USE TO COOL THOSE SURFACES CANNOT BE SO COLD THAT IT CAUSES VESO CONSTRICTION BECAUSE AS I MENTION EARLIER THE ARTERIOL VENOUS ASTEMOSIES THESE PORTALS OF ARTERIES DIRECTLY TOVEINS THAT EXIST ONLY IN THESE GLABYRU SKIN SURFACES THE WAY THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO COOL THE BODY AND ESSENTIALLY PASS COOL INTO THE BODY ALTHOUGH THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT THEY'R DOING THEIR ACTUALLY EXTRACTING HEAT FROM THE BODY TO BE TECHNICAL THER EXTRACTING HEAT FROM THE BODY THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN DO THAT IS IF THOSE VEINS DON'T COLLAPSE AND VEINS WILL COLLAPSE IF THEY ARE MADE VERY VERY COLD SO IF YOU WANT TO USE GLABYRUS SKIN COOLING TO OFFSIT HYPROTHERMIA OR FOR TE OTHER FORMS OF PERFORMANCE WHICH WEL TALK ABOUT IN A MOMENT YOU NEED TO USE A COOL OBJECT OR SURFACE THAT IS NOT SO COLD THAT CAUSES VAZO CONSTRICTION AND THIS CAN BE A LITTLE BIT TOUGH TO DILIN MEANING IT CAN BE TOUGH TO IDENTIFY SUCH AN OBJECT AND FOR THAT REASON DOCTOR HELLER AND SOME OF HIS COLLEGUES HAVE DEVELOPED A COMMERCIAL PRODUCT CALLED THE COOL MIT YOU CAN ACTUALLY GO TO THEIR WEBSIDE COOL MIT DOCKCALM I DON'T HAVE ANY FINANCIAL OR OTHER RELATIONSHIP TO THEM I KNOW THEY'VE BEEN DEVELOPING THIS TECHNOLOGY FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME IT INVOLVES A GLOVE THE YOU PUT YOUR HAND INTO IT CIRCULATES WATER OF A GIVEN TEMPERATURE AND IT DOES SO AND DOES SO AD A TEMPERATURE THAT IS SURE TO NOT CAUSEVAYS OF CONSTRICTION OF THE PALM AN YOU MAY BE ASKING HOW CAN YOU JUST PUT YOUR HAND INTO ONE GLOVE AND HAVE THIS WORK WELL THAT'S HOW POWERFUL THESE GLABER SKIN SURFACES ARE EVEN JUST BY COOLING ONE PALM THE COOR BODY TEMPERATURE DROPS RATICALLY NOW THAT'S THEIR COMMERCIAL TECHNOLOGY I KNOW THAT SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE HAVE STARTED TO EXPERIMENT WITH A HOME VERSION OF THIS WHICH WOULD BE TAKING A PACKAGE FOR INSTANCE OF FROSEN BLUEBERRIES OR SOME OTHER COLD DRINK OR COLD METAL OBJECT AN ACTUALLY BRINGING IT INTO THE GIM OR OUT ON A RUN THEYRE EVEN PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW DEVELOPING COOLD SYK A BICYCAL HANDLS FOR LONG RIDES A THIS MIGHT SEEM A LITTLE COOKI OR CRAZY TO YOU BUT AS YOU'LL SOON HERE IN THE STUDY AM ABOUT TO DESCRIBE THE INCREASES IN ENDURANCE AND IN THE VOLUME OF STRENGTH TRAINING THAT PEOPLE CAN CONDUCT IF THEY APPROPRIATELY COOL THEIR BODY THROUGH THIS THESE GLABYRU SKIN PORTALS IS ACTUALLY QUITE SIGNIFICANT SO AGAIN AS IT RELATES TO HYPEROTHERMIA SOME ONE IS OVER HEATING BY ALL MEANS TRYIND GET THEM OUT OF THAT HEAT GET THEM TO STOP EXERCISING YOU CAN DIE FROM HYPEROTHERMIA TRYING COOL THE BOTTOMS OF THE FEET THE PALMS OF THEIR HANDS AND TH E UPPER PORTION OF THEIR FACE THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT WOULD BE A BAD IDEA TO PUT COLD WATER ON THE TOP OF THEIR HEAD THAT PROBABLY WOULD ALSO HELP IN PERHAPS ON THEIR NECK WHAT IS PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE A GOOD IDEA IS TO DO THE MORE STANDARD THING OF DRAPING SOME ONE IN COLD TOWELS ON THE SURFACE OF THEIR BODY BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED THE BEGINNING OF THE EPISODE THAT THERMASTAT IN THE HYPOTHALMUS THE MEDIAL PREOPTICAREA WILL TYPICALLY REACT TO THAT BY INCREASING CORBODY TEMPERATURE FURTHER THE EFFECTS OF GLABER SKIN COOLING ON PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE ARE TRULY REMARKABLE PROVIDED THE GLABER SKIN COOLING IS DONE CORRECTLY AND I WANT A POINT OUT THAT THE MAIN DEGREE OF EFFACT IS ON VOLUME OR THE ABILITY TO DO MORE WORK AND I WANT A POINT THIS OUT BECAUSE I THINK THAT MANY PEOPLE CERTAINLY IN THE EXERCISE SCIENCE COMMUNITY BUT EVEN IN THE GENERAL PUBLIC WHEN THEY HEARABOUT SOME OF THESE EFFECTS THAT ARE MEASURED IN THE LABORATORY THEY SOR F LOOK A AT THOSE EFFECTS OF BIT OF SCANCE ANYTHING WILE THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE RIGHT A EFFECTS FOR INSTANCE THAT HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED SHOWING DOUBLING OR TRIPLING OF THE NUMBER OF DIPS THAT ONE CAN DO IN A RELATIVELY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME OR DOUBLING OF THE NUMBER OF PULLUPS ONE CAN DO OR FOURTEEN PERCENT INCREASES IN STRENGTH OR EVEN COMPARABLE DEGREES IN INCREASE IN WEIGHT TRAINING OUTPUT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE ON PERFORMANCE ENHANCING DRUGS ET CETER ET CETERA PART OF THE CONFUSION IS THAT THE EFFECTS OF PROPER PALMER COOLING BECAUSE IT ALMOST ALWAYS IS DONE BY PALMER COOLING AND LESS OFTEN IN OF THESE EXPERIMENTS BY COOLING OF THE BOOMS OF THE FEET IN THE UPPER PORTION OF THE FACE BUT THOSE EFFECTS TEND TO BE THE ABILITY TO DO MORE WORK OVER TIME AND JUST TO ILLUSTRATE SOME OF THE MAJOR OFFACTS THAT THE HELLER LAP IS SEEN AND THERE ARE DOCUMENTED IN THIS MANUSCRIPT THAT ALL SHARE WITH YOU IN A MOMENT THE TYPICAL PROTOCAL IS TO HAVE PEOPLE COME IN AND DO SOME ENDURANCE TRAININGS OR RUNNING ON A TREAD MILL AND TO HAVE A CONDITION WHERE ONE GROUP IS ACTUALLY DOING PALMER COOLING WHILE THEY ARE ON A BIKER ON A TREAD MILL AND INEVITABLY THE OUTCOME IS THAT THEY CAN DO MORE WORK THEY CAN PEDDLE FURTHER AT A GIVEN SPEED OR THEY CAN RUN LONGER AT A GIVEN SPEED THAN PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT DOING PALMER COOLING OR WHO ARE RECEIVING COOLING BY WAY OF IN COLD COMPRESS TO THE BACK OF THE NECK OR ICE BACT O TO THE ARM PITS ET CETERA SO THE EFFECTS OF PALMER COOLING ARE VERY CLEAR AND VERY ROBUST AND IN THE CONTECTS OF ENDURANCE EXERCISE ALMOST ALWAYS ALLOW PEOPLE TO DO MORE WORK TO GO LONGER WITH LESS PERCEIVED EFFORT AND TO QUIT LATER SO TO SPEAK IN TERMS OF STRAINTH TRAINING THEY'VE LOOKED AT THE CAPACITY TO PERFORM SETS OF DIPS SO ONE OF THE MORE FAMOUS EXAMPLES OF THIS THAT DOCTOR HELLER SHARES IN THE EPISODE AH THAT WE DID EARLIER AND THAT YOU CAN FIND AT HUBERMAN LABDOT CALM INVOLVES SOME ONE COMING IN AND DOING SETS OF DIPS MAY BE FORTY DIPS THIS PERSON ACTUALLY COULD DO FORTY DIPS ON THEIR FIRST SET THAN RESTING FOR A PERIOD OF TWO TO THREE MINUTES AND THEN DOING THIRTY FIVE AND THEN RESTING FOR A PERIOD OF TWO OR THREE MINUTES AND THEN DOING PROGRESSIVELY FEWER AND FE ARE IN FUER TO THE POINT WHERE OVER A PERIOD OF TIME THEY AD UP THE TOTAL NUMBER OF DIPS THAT THEY CAN DO AND THEN THEY HAVE THEM COME BACK AFTER A PERIOD OF RECOVERY SO NOT IMMEDIATELY AFTER BUT TAKE A COUPLE OF DAYS COME BACK AND DO EFFECTIVELY THE SAME PROTOCAL BUT DURING THEIR REST PERIODS THEY ARE DOING TWO MINUTES OF PALMER COOLING WHICH EXSET ESENTIALLY ALLOWS HEAT TO MOVE OUT OF THE BODY LOWERING CORBODY TEMPERATURE IN OTHER WORDS AND WHAT THEY FIND IS THAT THEY SEE ENORMOUS INCREASES IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF DIPS THAT PEOPLE CAN DO BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE PERSON GOES FROM BEING ABLE TO DO FORTY DIPS TO BEING ABLE TO DO FIFTY DIPS ARE SIXTY DIPS ON THAT FIRST SET WHAT IT MEANS THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO DO FORTY ON THE FIRST SET THAN FORTY ON THE SECOND THAN THIRTY EIGHT ON THE THIRD AND SO ON AND SO FORTH SO THAT THE TOTAL DURATION OF THE WORK OUT AS EXTENDED AND YET THEY'RE DOING MUCH MORE WORK EVEN THOUGH IT TAKES MORE TIME SO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT AND I THING A A POINT THAT PERHAPS WASN'T AS CLEAR A WHERE IS CLEARLY MADE BY ME IN THE PREVIOUS EPISODES THAT DISCUSS THIS TOPIC FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE INTERESTED AN EXPLORING PALMER COOLING FIRST OF ALL I RECOMMEND TAKING A BRIEF GLANCE OR EVEN DIVE INTO THIS STUDY WHICH IS ENTITLED WORK VOLUME AND STRAINED TRAINING RESPONSES TO RESISTIF EXERCISE IMPROVE WITH PERIODIC HEAT EXTRACTION FROM THE PALM IN THIS STUDY THEY DESCRIBE BIG INCREASES IN ANAROBIC MEANING STRAINT TRAINING OUTPUT THINGS LIKE IMPROVEMENT IN DIPS IMPROVEMENT IN BENCH PRESS IMPROVEMENT IN PULLUPS ET CETERA IN HUMAN SUBJECTS AND IT'S A REALLY NICE STUDY AND POINTS TO SOME OF THE PROTOCALS THAT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO ADAPT IN YOUR OWN SET UP FOR INSTANCE OVER SIX WEEKS OF PULL UP TRAINING PALM POOLING IN BETWEEN SETS IMPROVED VOLUME BY A HUNDRED FORTY FOR PER CENT AND THIS WAS AN EXPERIENCE SUBJECTS SO THAT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE A LOT OF STUDIES OF STRAINT TRAINING IN IMPROVEMENCE IN HYPERTROPHEAN STRENGTH ARE DONE IN INEXPERIENCE A UNTRAINED ATHLETES WHICH CAN  YO CHAINGES THE PICTURE SOMEWHAT COMPARED TO A EXPERIENCE DATHLETES THEY FOUND THAT STREINGTH MEANING THE ONE REPETITION MAXIMUM INCREASE TWENTY TWO PER CENT OVER TEN WEEKS IN BENCH PRESS TRAINING AND THEY POINT TO THE PARTICULARLY STRONG EFFECTS OF USING PALMER COOLING WHEN PEOPLE REACH PLATEAUS IN ENDURANCE AND STRAINTH TRAINING AND THERE I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT I THINK THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO EXPLORE PALMER COOLING IT'S PROBABLY NOT THE SORT OF THING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IN EVERY RUN OR IN EVERY BOUT OF CYCLING OR IN EVERY STRAINTH TRAINING SESSION BUT THAT IT MIGHT BE USED TO VASTLY INCREASE YOUR VOLUME ANDOR VASTLY INCREASE YOUR ENDURANCE IN A GIVEN SESSION OR A SET OF SESSIONS IN ORDER TO PUSH THROUGH PLATEAUS A PARTICULARLY INTERESTING POINT IN LIGHT OF THAT IS DOCTOR HELLER HAS OBSERVED AGAIN AND AGAIN THAT PALMER COOLING REDUCES DELAYED ON SET MUSCLE SORENESS OR CAN ELIMINATE IT ENTIRELY AND THAT'S VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE IT ALSO POINTS TO HE FACT THAT REDUCING CORBODY TEMPERATURE MAY SOMEHOW BE INVOLVED IN SHORT CIRCUITING THE NORMAL MECHANISMS OF DELIGHT DELAYED ON SET MUSCLE SORNSS AND YOU MIGHT SAY WEHOW WOULD TEMPERATURE BE INVOLVED INTO LAYD ON SET MUSCLE SORENESS WELL I WANT TO REFER YOU BACK TO THE MEDAANAL SYS TO WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIERE WHERE THE SHORT DURATION VERY COLD TEMPERATURE EXPOSURE AFTER TRAINING DID INDEED REDUCED TO LAID ON SET MUSCLE SORENESS IN PART THROUGH REREDUCTIONS CUVES ME IN CREATING KINAS SO IT'S NOT OM INCONCEIVABLE THAT TEMPERATURE AND DELAYED ON SET MUSCLESORENESS ARE RELATED AND THAT RAISES PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT WHICH IS THE WAY THAT PALMER COOLING CAN IMPROVE PERFORMANCE BY WAY OF REDUCING CORBODY TEMPERATURE IS KNOWN AND THAT IS BECAUSE WHEN ONE ENGAGES IN EXERCISE WER MUSCULAR OUTPUT OF ANY KIND STRENGTH OR ENDURANCE EXERCISE THE RANGE OF TEMPERATURES UNDER WHICH A MUSCLE CAN PERFORM IS ACTUALLY VERY NARROW THERE IS AN ENDS IN CALLED PIRUVATE CINASE WHICH IS CRITICAL TO MUSCLE CONTRACTIONS AND PIRUVATE CINASE CAN ONLY FUNCTION IN A VERY NARROW RANGE OF TEMPERATURES IF THAT TEMPERATURE GETS TO HOT MEANING IF THE MUSCLE HEATS UP LOCALLY WHETHER NOT BY RUNNING OR CYCLING OR SWIMMING OR WEIGHT LIFTING THE ABILITY FOR THAT MUSCLE TO CONTINUE TO CONTRACT IS REDUCED AND EVENTUALLY IS SHORT CIRCUITED COMPLETELY AND I THINK THIS IS A MUCH UNDER EXPLORATOR AT LEAST A MUCH UNDERDISCUSSED ASPECT OF SO CALLED MUSCULAR FAILURE OR THE FAILURE OF ONE TO CONTINUE TO ENDURE IN RUNNING SO FERINC AS WHEN YOU RUN AS COMPARED TO A BENCH PRESS OR SOMETHING YOU DON'T STOP RUNNING BECAUSE YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY CONTRACT THE MUSCLES FURTHER BUT SOMEHOW SIGNALS ABOUT THE HEATING UP OF MUSCULAR TISSUE ARE CONVEYED TO THE BRAIN THERE'S A CROSS TALK THERE ITS PROBABLY BY DIRECTIONAL AND PEOPLE STOP THEY QUIT RIGHT THIS IS THE QUITTING REFLEC IN STRENGTH TRAINING ONE CAN NO LONGER PERFORM A REPETITION OR SET OF REPETITIONS IN PART BECAUSE OF HEATING UP OF THE MUSCLE LOCALLY THERER OTHER MECHANISMS AS WELL OF COURSE AND I REALISE THAT BUT WHAT'S VERY CLEAR FROM THE PALMER COOLING WORK IS THAT BY SIMPLY HOLDING ON TO A COOL OBJECT REMEMBER NOT AN OBJECT SO COLD THAT IT CONSTRICTS THE VESSELS OF THE PALMS OR CONSTRICTS THE VESSELS ON THE BOTTOMS OF THE FEET BUT BY HOLDING ON TO A RELATIVELY COOL OBJECT IN ONE OR BOTH HANDS IN BETWEEN SETS FOR TWO MINUTES OR SO YOU CAN VERY EFFICIENTLY REDUCE YOUR CORBODY TEMPERATURE AND IN DOING SO REDUCE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE MUSCLES THAT ARE DOING THE WORK INCREASE THE CAPACITY FOR PIRUVA CINASE TO CONTINUE TO ALLOW YOUR MUSCLES TO CONTRACT AND THEREBY ALLOW YOU TO DO MORE VOLUME OF ENDURANCE AND STRENGTHTRAINING SO A SIMPLE PROTOCALL THAT DOCTOR HELLER PASS TO ME IS FIND A RELATIVELY COOL OBJECTS O YOU COULD FOR INSTANCE FILL TOO BOTTLES WITH COLD WATER MAY BE PUT A FEW ICE CUBES IN THERE RIGHT THIS IS NOT EXACT BECAUSE WERE NOT HUNG ABOUT THE COMMERCIAL COLMIT PRODUCT HERE WERE TALKING ABOUT AN AT HOME VERSION OR USE A PACK OF FROZEN BLUEBERRIES OR BROCHLY A SOR OF PACK OF THOSE AS WHAT HE DESCRIBED AND THEN IN BETWEEN SETS TO PUT YOUR HANDS AND IDEAL YOU'D PUT THE BOMSO YOUR FEET BUT THAT'S NOT ALWAYS FEASIBLE AN MOST GEMS WHERE THEY WON'T LET YOU TAKE OFF YOUR SHOOES AND SO FORTH BUT TO PUT YOUR THE PALMS YOUR HANDS ON THAT COOL SURFACE FOR A MINUTE OR TWO MINUTES BETWEEN SETS AND THEN RETURNING TO YOUR SETS OF WORK NOW IF YOU ARE HEATING UP THROUGH OTHER MECHANISMS LIKE YOUR WEARING A STOCKING CAP IN YOURE I A VERY WARM ENVIRONMENT THIS MIGHT NOT HAVE AS POTENT EFFECT AS IF YOU WERE TO DO THIS COOLING IN A MORE MODERATE ENVIRONMENT WEARING LIGHTER CLOTHING ET CETERA SO BY ALL MEANS WARM UP TO DO YOUR EXERCISE LUBRICATE YOUR JOINTS AND GET INTO A PLACE WHERE YU'RE NOT IN INJURE YOURSELF DOING WHATEVER FORM OF EXERCISE YOU DO BUT THEN IF YOU LIKE TO EXPLORE PALMER COOLING I KNOW A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE WITTEN TO ME SAYING THEY HEARD ABOUT PALMER COOLING ON THE EPISODE WITH DOCTOR HELLER THEY'VE TRIED THIS AND THEY SEE QUITE EXCELLENT RESULTS IT DOES TAKE SOME DISCIPLINE RIGHT IT'S ONE THING TO JUST CON TO HANG OUT IN THE GIM AND PLAN YOUR PHONE IN BETWEEN SETS ITS ANOTHER TO DO DELIBERATE COOLING WITH YOUR PALMS YOR THE BOTTOM AS YOUR FEET OF THE UPPER PORTION OF YOUR FACE MIGHT GET SOME WEARD LOOKS BUT OF COURSE YOU'LL BE THE ONE DOING SIGNIFICANTLY MORE VOLUME NOT EXPERIENCING TO LAYD ON SET MUSCLE SORENESS AND ACHIEVING BETTER ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH GAINS WERE YOU TO DO THIS PROPERLY NOW AS A FINAL TOPIC RELATED TO THE USE OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE FOR IMPROVING HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE I LET TO TOUCH ON THIS THEME THAT EXISTS ON LINE ON SOCIA MEDIA ON UTUBE AND IN VARIOUS FITNESS COMMUNITIES OF USING DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE TO THE GROWING IN PARTICULAR TO THE TESTACLES IN ORDER TO TRY AND INCREASE TESTSTRONE AND WHILE THIS MIGHT SOUND REALLY COKI INDEED THIS PRACTICE EXISTS INDEED IF YOU WERE TO GO ON THE AMAZON THERE ARE ACTUALLY A ICE PACK UNDERWARE THAT HAVE A THAT ARE BEING MARKETED FORSAKE OF INCREASING TESTOSTRON NOW I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY SPECIFIC WELL CONTROLLED STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT THIS INDEED WORKS I CAN IMAGINE BASED ON WHAT I KNOW ABOUT THE NERVOUS SYSTEM TESTOSTERONE AND COLD ET CETERA THAT THERE ARE COUPLE OF MECHANISMS BY WHICH ONE MIGHT EXPERIENCE INCREASES IN TESTOSTRON AS A CONSEQUENCE OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE FIRST OFF LET ME SAY THERE IS NO REASON WHY YOU WOULD HAVE TO APPLY THESE ICE BACKS IN THE WAY THAT I JUST DESCRIBED ONE COULD OF COURSE TAKE A COLD SHOWER ONE COULD OF COURSE USE A COLD IMMERSION OF VARIOUS KINDS AND YOUR STILL GIN TO GET THAT EXPOSURE A OF THE GROING AND THE TESTACLES TO COLD NOW I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT PEOPLE DO REPORT AT LEAST ANECDOTALLY INCREASES IN TESTOSTRON AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS PRACTICE AND I HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT THEY ARE MEASURING THEIR SEREM TESTOSTRONE THAT THEYRE NOT JUST GUESSING THAT THEIR TESTOSTRONE WENT UP IF YOU KNOW OF A STUDY EXPLORING THIS DIRECTLY PLEASE LET ME KNOW I'L PUT IN THE COMMEN SECTION ON YOU TO OR EVEN JUST EMAL ME A WE HAVE A A EMALE THAT YOU CAN FIND IT HUBRAN LABDOT COM PLEASE EMAL ME THE REFERENCE I WASN'T ABLE TO FIND A REFERENCE BUT I CAN IMAGINE TWO REASONABLY PLAUSIBLE MECHANISMS BY WHICH DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE TO THE GROWING IN PRODU THAT THE TESTACALS WOULD INCREASE TESTOSTRON THE FIRST IS SOMEWHAT DIRECT WHICH IS THAT ANY TIME YOU COOL A BODY SURFACE THAT IF IT'S COLD ENOUGH YOUARE GOING TO GET VASO CONSTRICTION AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY YOU ARE GOING TO GET A REBOUND INCREASE IN VAZO DILATION MEANING YOUARE GOING TO CONSTRICT THE BLOOD VESSELS IN THAT AREA AND THEN AFTER THE COLD IS REMOVED THERE'S GOING TO BE MORE BLOOD FLOW TO THAT AREAN OF COURSE BLOOD FLOW RELATES TO ORGAN HEALTH AND TISSUE HEALTH GENERALLY SO PROFUSION OF THAT REGION AND THOSE A AND THE GONATS TO BE SPECIFIC WITH ADDITIONAL BLOOD YOU COULD IMAGINE IN SOME WAYS INCREASING TESTASTRON THAT'S REASONABLY PLAUSIBLE THE OTHER PROBABLY MORE LIKELY MECHANISM RELATES TO THE DOPAMINE INCREASES CAUSE BY COLD EXPOSURE THT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER AGAIN ANY TIME YOU HAVE A SOMEWHAT STRESFUL STIMULUS BUT IN PARTICULAR WITH COLD EXPOSURE IT SEEMS THAT THE CATACOLAMEANS NOR UP IN EFFERAN EPINEFERAN ENDOPAMINE ALL INCREASE AND DOPAMINE IS KNOWN TO BE IN THE PATHWAY THAT CAN STIMULATE TESTOSTRON AND SO WHILE THERE ISN'T A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DOPAMINE STIMULANE TESTOTRON THERE IS AN INTERESTING PATHWAYE WHEREBY DOPAMINE INCREASES CAN TRIGGER INCREASES IN THINGS LIKE LUTINIZING HORMON WHICH CAN TRIGGER INCREASES IN TESTASTRON AS WELL AS ESTERGEN FOR THAT MATTER SO I KNOW THAT THERERA LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT ARE INTERESTED IN THE USE OF COLD EXPOSURE FOR INCREASING TESTASTRON AND SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE AND COMMUTIES ARE INDEED USING COLD EXPOSURE DIRECTLY ON THE GONADS ON THE TESTES IN ORDER TO DO THIS I'M NOT CERTAIN THAT THAT DIRECT CONTACT IS NECESSARY AND IN SOME CASES IT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE QUITE DANGEROUS OR YOU ATLEAST SHOULD BE CAREFUL IN TERMS OF E TISSUES THERE AND AVOIDING DAMAGE BUT NONE THE LESS I THINK THAT A DOPAMINE IMPACT ON TESTOSTRONE IS VERY LIKELY GIVEN THE TWO HUNDER N FIFTY PERCENT INCREASES IN DOPAMINE THAT HAVE BEEN OBSERVED WITH COLD WATER IMMERSION AND ALL OF THAT POINTS O THE FACT THAT COLD WATER IMMERSION VERY LIKELY INCREASES TESTOSTRON BUT AS A DOWNSTREAM CONSEQUENCE OF THE COLD WATER IMMERSION EFFECTS ON DOPAMINE AND LUTINIZING HORMON AND AGAIN THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK THAT THE INCREASES IN LUTNIZING HORMON WOULD ALSO INCREASE ESTURGEN PROBABLY NOT TO A DANGEROUS OR A LEVELS THAT ONE A WOULD WANT TO AVOID BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THEREIS ANYTHING PARTICULARLY SPECIFIC ABOUT COLD FOR INDUSING TESTASTRON AND NOT OTHER HORMONS I THING ITS VERY LIKELY TO INCREASES A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT HORMONS I DO HOPE THAT THERE WILL BE A SYSTEMATIC STUDY ON THIS IN THE NOT TO DISTANT FUTURE I ALSO HOPE TO NOT BE A SUBJECT IN THE COOLING OF THE GONAT'S EXPERIMENT NOW I PROMISE YOU THE LAST TOPIC WAS THE LAST TOPIC BUT THERE'S ONE OTHER REALLY IMPORTANT POINT THAT I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD BE AWARE OF IF YOU ARE GOING TO USE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE AND THAT BRINGS US BACK TO THE VERY FIRST HING THAT WE DISCUSSED TO DAY ALONG THE LINES OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE WHICH IS THAT YOUR BASELYING TEMPERATURE IS GOING TO BE LOWEST ABOUT TWO HOURS BEFORE YOU WAKE UP IT'S GOING TO INCREASE IN THE MORNING AND AS YOU WAKE UP AND INCREASE THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND AFTERNOON AND THEN START TO DROP IN THE EVENING AND COME DOWN AT NIGHT AS YOU HAD TO SLEEP I ALSO WANT YOU TO REMEMBER THAT IF YOU ARE TO COOL THE EXTERNAL PORTION OF YOUR BODY IN PARTICULAR YOUR TORSO THE NET EFFECT OF THAT IS GOING TO BE AN INCREASE IN BODY TEMPERATURE SO FOR MANY PEOPLE NOT ALL BUT FOR MANY PEOPLE IF YOU ARE GOING TO DO DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE YOU ARE GOING TO INCREASE YOUR COR BODY TEMPERATURE AND THAT MAKE SENSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT HOW DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE CAN INCREASE TABOLISM BY INCREASING THERMAGENESIS WHAT THAT ALL MEANS IS THAT IF YOU ARE DOING YOUR DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE EARLY IN THE DAY YOU ARE GOING TO GET YET A FURTHER INCREASE IN COR BODY TEMPERATURE THAT WOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH WAKEFULNESS YOUR ABILITY TO BE ALERT THAT MORNING OR THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND SO ON IT ALSO MEANS THAT IF YOU DO YOUR DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE VERY LATE IN THE EVENING OR AT NIGHT SO SIX P M SEVEN P M NINE P M AND SO ON YOU ARE GOING TO INCREASE YOUR CORBODY TEMPERATURE IN IT F YOU RECALL A DECREASE IN CORBODY TEMPERATURE OF ONE TO THREE DEGREES IS NOT JUST THAN EFFICIAL BUT IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO GET INTO DEEP SLEEP AND REMAIN IN DEEP SLEEP SO THE TAKE AWAY FROM THIS IS DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE DONE PROPERLY WILL INCREASE YOUR COREBODY TEMPERATURE AND MAKE YOU FEEL MORE ALERT SO IF YOUR DOING IT EARLY IN THE DAY THAT'S PROBABLY TERRIFIC GIVEN THAT MOST OF US WANT TO BE ALERT DURING THE DIGHT HOWEVER IF YOU DO IT TOO LATE IN THE DAY EVENING OR NIGHT IT CAN DISRUP SLEEP BY WAY OF DISTRUPTING YOUR COREBODY TEMPERATURE NOW THE COVIAT TO THAT IS I MYSELF TEN TO DO MY DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE EARLY IN THE DAY MAY BE NOT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING BUT MIDMORNING MAY BE AS LATE AS THREE OR FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON IN SOME CASES IN THE LONGER DAYS OF SUMMER I MIGHT DO IT EVEN LATER FIVE OR SIX P M AND HAVE NO TROUBLE SLEEPING I HAVE DONE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE VERY LATE AT NIGHT TEN P M ELEVEN P M AND SO ON AS PART OF A THIRTY DAY CHALLENGE OF DOING DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE EVERY DAY FOR THIRTY DAYS AND I GOT SLOPPY WITH MY TIMING AND THEN IN ORDER TO NOT MISS A DAY I WOULD DO IT AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT AND I MUST SAY I FOUND THAT I COULD STILL FALL ASLEEP VERY EASILY EVEN DOING DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE VERY LATE AT NIGHT HOWEVER ON THOSE PARTICULAR DAYS I WAS PARTICULARLY BUSY AND SIAS PARTICULARLY EXHAUSTED WHEN I ARRIVED AT THE DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE AND I HAD NO TROUBLE FALLING ASLEEP AFTER DOING DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE AND THEN TAKING A NICE WARM SHOWER AND THEN GOING TO SLEEP BUT I COULD IMAGINE THAT BECAUSE OF THE INCREASES IN COREBODY TEMPERATURE CAUSED BY DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE THAT WERE ONE TO DO THAT TOO LATE IN THE DAY EVENING OR NIGHT THAT IT COULD INDEED DESRUPT YOUR SLEP SO MY RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE FOR MOST PEOPLE ONLY DO DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE IF YOU ARE PREPARED TO BE FAIRLY ALERT FOR THE NEXT ONE TO FOUR OR MAY BE EVEN SIX HOURS FOLLOWING THAT DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE SO FOR TO DAY'S EPISODE AS IS THE CASE WITH MOST EPISODES OF THE HUBERMAN LABPOCAST I COVERED A LOT OF MATERIAL WE TALK TABOUT MECHANISMS OF CATACOLOMEANES AND STRESTS AND PULSOTILE RELEASE OF EPINEPHERAN METABOLISM MENTAL EFFACTS PERFORMANCE GLABER SKINCOLLY AND ON AND ON AND ON AND WHILE THE GOAL OF CORUS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY ONE ARRIVES AT SPECIFIC VERY CLEAR MECHANISTIC AND ACTIONABLE PROTOCOLS I DO REALIZE THAT IT IS AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION AND FOR THAT REASON I HAVE CREATED A LIST OF DELIBERATE COLD EXPOSURE

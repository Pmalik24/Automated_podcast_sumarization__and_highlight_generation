welcome to the huberman laponcas ts of science science space to i mandrer hubermen and am a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine. This podcast is separate for my teaching research rolls at Stamford it is however part of my desire an effort to bring zerocostic consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public. Let us continue our discussion about nerrow plasticity this incredible feature of our nervous syctem that allows it to change itself in response to experience and even in ways that we consciously and deliberately decide to change it. We are also going to explore that aspect of nero plasticity and we are going to do that in the context of a very sensitive and somewhat sensitive injury which is somewhat sensitive in some cases. We will also talk about what we call unlearning or removing some aspect of our experience of our life and how we do and do not want to undo things that we do or don't want to do and that is going to be a very important topic in the future of this podcast. We hope to see you on the next episode of the Huberman Laponcasts of Science Science space to i mandrer Hubermen on Thursday, September 14th at 10:30am ET.

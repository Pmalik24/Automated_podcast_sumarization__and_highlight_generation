welcome to the huberman lapontcas science science face to s for i mander hubermen and om a professor of neurobology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine. This month we have been talking about the senses how we detect things in our environment the last episode was all about vision how we take light and convert that information into things that we can perceive collors and faces and motion things of that sort. We are going to talk about chemicals that are made by other human beings that powerfully modulate the way that we feel the way our hormones in our health now that last category are sometimes called pherimmones however whether not they exist in humans is rather controversial there has not been a clear example of a true peremonal effect but what is absolutely clear what is that there ar chemicals that make human beings make things that powerfully release in things like tears on our skin and even breath. We will also talk about chemical sensing and how we use light to change our biology an ways that are subconscious that we do not realize things mood and metabolism and levels of alertness. And we will talk about a lot of protocols even though i'm not guessing it are not all of us alone even if you are completely completely your chemical environment internally is being controlled by external chemicals your nervous system and your metabolism or your hormones or can talk about those things in your environment or can talks about those that are being modified by your environment as well as the ways in which the microbium interacts with your mun system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without letic greens it get the vitemens i need the minerals i need and the probics to support my microbiom.

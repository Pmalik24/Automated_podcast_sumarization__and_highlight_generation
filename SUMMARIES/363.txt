Doctor suzanna soberg is a professor of nerbiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicin to day. Her research is focused on how deliberate cold exposure and deliberate heat exposure can be used to enhance human metabolism. She is considered one of the world's leading experts on these topics. We discuss the effects of cold and heat on things narrow transmitter production namely dopamine and epinepran and norepine from the call cata colamines which strongly impact mood and metabolism. We also talk about the key roll of hydration and electrolytes for nerv r sell function nuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodia manesium and potassium present in the proparatios all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and ifhydration is not present we simply cannot think as well, otherwise our mood is diminished and all sorts of other things can go off the rails. We talk about almost every single nuants and variation on deliberate cold and deliberateheat exposure protocals as it relates to the underlying science in particular how cold receptors that the level of the skin are impacted verses cold reception and perception at thelevel of the brain and how all of that impact the brain embody relating to mental health physical health and performance based on her scientific research and academic training aswell as her understanding of her understanding and use of deliberte heat and deliberatecold exposureprotocals. We end the day with a look back at the story of how we got connected which was a little bit of a back story that i've been interested in for many years that was connected to how we get connected to each other.

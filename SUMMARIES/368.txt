Nurl link is a company whose goal is to develop tecnologies to overcome specific clenical challenges of the brain and nervous system as well as to improve upon brain design. The company is uniquely poised to accomplish these goals because they are combining existing knowledge of brain function from the fields of nero science and nero surgery with robotics machine learning computer science and the development of novel devices in order to change the ways that human brains work for the better. We also get into an extensive conversation about the utility of animal verses human research in probing brain function and in devicing and improving the human brain and in overcoming disease in terms of nur surgery and nrl link' goals by the end of to day's episode you will have a much clearer understanding of how human brains works and how they can be improved by robodics and engineering. We end the day with a discussion about the benefits of electrolite in the body and how it can lead to cognitive and physical performances in the human body that are far better than they ever have been in the course of human evolution. i'd like to thank the sponsors of day's potcast our first sponsor is an element element with everything you do with that is magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to function of the nerve cells called nurons. I also want to thank our sponsor caled electrolytes and no sugar and no salt for their support of the day's show. i know that myght sounalobit mysterious but you will soon learn exactly what i'm referring to and by the way he also emplanted his family members with similar devices while all this might sound a litimate science fiction this is truly science reality. It is however part of my desire and efforts to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the public.

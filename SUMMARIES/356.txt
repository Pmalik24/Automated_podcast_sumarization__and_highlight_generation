The first question is about the prose and cons of daily caffin consumption the question reads what is your opinion on the net benefit ofdaily caffine consumption. The current estimates are that ninety per cent of the world consumes every single day while nine per cent throughout the right 90% of adults consume kaffine daily on a daily basis. For most adults that is people about age eighteen to twenty or no older daily caffeine consumption is not going to be a problem provided it does not induce anxiety and certainly provided that not induced anxiety or panic attacks and provided that it doesnot to strupt your night time sleep this is why i always recommend that if you are going to consume kaffeine in any form coffee t soda or otherwise that you try not to injest kaffin within the eight an idealy within the ten or even twelve hours prior to bedtime that is because the half life of kaffins is such that even if you can have a cup of coffee around three p m or four p m and then fall asleep around midnight the architecture of the sleep that you get is going to get disrupted. If you are able to drink kaffi in the late afternoon mabe even at night and still fall asleep but do not make it a regular habit you will sleep far better. The architecture of your sleep will be better and you will feel far more rested the next day if you abstain from coffee for the eight to twelve hours before bedtime.

welcome to the hubermansciencescience paceto ri may drew hubermen and on or professor of nerbiology and opthomology at stampord school of medicine to day we are going to discuss the use of deliberate cold exposure for health and performance. temperature is a powerful stimulus on our nervous system and indeed on every organ and system of our body and cold in particular can be leverage to improve mental health physical health. We are also going to talk about a very specific protocols that you can apply which leverage variables temperature how cold how to deliver the cold for instance whether not use a cold shower cold immersion ice bath circulating water or still water whether not your going for walks outside in a teacher when its cold or whether or not your purposeuly using things crio if you have access to that or not one thing i can promise you is that by the end of to day's episode you will know a lot about the biology of thermal regulation that is how your brain in body regulates its temperature. i promise to spel out all those protocols in detail as i go along and to summarize them again at the end id to make a point now that i am going to make several additional times during to dayâ€™s episode. Please proceed with caution always please also understand that the most potent stimulus is not always the one that you experience as the most intense in the moment in fact i would encourage you to find the minimum threshol of stimulus that will allow you to derive the maximum benefit from each protocol and indeed i will point out what those thresholds ought to be today i'll iv you some simple formulas a gauges or guides thatyou can use in order to navigate this extremely interesting and potent tool that we call deliberate cold Exposure.

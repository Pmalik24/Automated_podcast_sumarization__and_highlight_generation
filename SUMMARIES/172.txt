The vidio is from the front lines of the war an you crane it is from a few weeks ago and it is in buchmout which is a city in the eastern part of the country. The guy who shot it is part of a team of volunteers who help people get out of the city. The problem is people do not want to go and some do not think the worst is over or they will not leave other family members who will soon be over or the other winds will calme down.

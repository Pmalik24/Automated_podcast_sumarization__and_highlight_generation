welcome to the huberman ladpocas discuss science sciencpace t s i mander huber man and am professor of narbiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine. This is an ask me anything episode or a m a this is part of our premium subscriber channel. The first question is about i health in particular for people that are age ing but i health protocalls for people in general the question is i'm noticing that my vision both close and far is deteriorating what are the best i exercises i health behaviors supplements et cetera for the aging eye the answer i'm about to provide applies to everybody regardless of age. If you want your vision to be maintained or even improve it is going to be very important for you to view things at a distance as well for i geally several hours per day ow realise some people just simply will not accomplish this in fact i'd everyone at just take a moment and do a rough estimation in your head of how much time during your day time activities you are viewing things at say two and a half feet or three feet or less. There is a classic experiment that would just briefly describe you which has been performed in chickens and it is also performed on humans where a visual cluder or a visual image is just included in a black screen or a black sacker or a piece of cardboard or some other unoblacker that may be in someones home or on a computer screen or even in a cardboard piece or piece of paper. It is just a visual experiment that can also move the eye but also that the length of the eyeball from front to back is impacted by how close or how far you view things during the course of your day.

welcome to the huberman aoscience sciencepaceto i man drew hubermen and om a professor of neurobiology and opthomology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor sam harris. i mainly talk to doctor harris about his views and practices related to meditation consciousness and free will. We also discuss the called mind body problem and issues of duality and freeWill concepts from philosophy in narrow science. i push sam to share with us what his specific practices are and how we can all arrive at a clear and better understanding of a meditation practice that we can each in all apply. i also ask sam about his recent voluntary decision to close his twitter account and how he feels about doing that and i think you will find that this will be very interesting as well before you begin you begin that this podcast is separate from my research in research rolls at Stamford. i want t emphasize that my mention of the ap is in no way a paid promotional rather the waking up ap is one that i've used for some period of time now and fine very very useful i family members that also use it other staff members here thehubermnlab podcast use it because we find it to be such a powerful tool. i'd like to thank the sponsors of day's podcast for their support in keeping with the theme of keeping with consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public.

welcome to the huberan ladpodcas u science science base to ni mandeur huberman and on roprofessor of nerbiology and optomology at stamford school of medicine to day. We are going to explore the foundations of your biology in your brain and body that allow any protocol to work because as it turns out all of the protocols out there tap in to and leverage a course set of just a few biological mechanisms that is right beneath everything you are able to do and feel. By the end of to day's episode you will have far more knowledge about your biology and psychology than you did at the start and you will be armed with many more tools and most importantly Princ opales that you can navigate not just the tools presented on this pod cast but in the vast landscape of tools that are out there for mental health physical health and performance. The first author is nora no wack and w a k and the first ominant discuss both relate to sleep and sleep states and had a access better sleep the first one was publish in the journal sell report sell press journal excellent journal the title of this paper is rapid and reversible control of human metabolism by individual sleep states we will provide link to the study in the show captions. The second one is focused on how different sleep states of sleep such as rapid i movement which is associate with dreaming and slow waved verses slow waved sleep which tends to be more focussed on the physical body and more mondane on the mental body and how those relate to different states of mind during sleep. There are many studies of metabolism there are many different types of metabolism that occur while sleep as far as we know this is one of the first studies of this kind. What they found was absolutely fascinating first of all they found that sleep states regulate more than fifty per cent of all the metabolite features in human breath.

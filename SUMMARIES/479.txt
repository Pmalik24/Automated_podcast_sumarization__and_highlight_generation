welcome to the hubermenlaoca science science ace to r i maindrew huberman and om a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine. We are going to talk about something that is vitally important both for physical performance and short term health and that is endurance. We will also talk about how to train endurance that are very different than the ways that you would have previously trained for it. There will also be a new topic entirely covered in this episode but we do do one more episode on physical performance for the simple reason that you asked many questions about it. We hope you will join us for the next episode of our science and science-related podcast, which will be hosted by Dr. Andrew Wexler and co-hosted by Professor of Neurobiology and Opthemology, Dr.  Om Wojciechowski. The podcast will be available on iTunes, Stitcher, Google Play, and other mobile devices and will be webcast on a weekly basis from 10 a.m. to 11 a.M. ET.

This week the shou looks at the impact of one woman's wake up moment. We also hear from people who have had the same thing happen to them. And we look at some of the ways in which the world has changed in the past two years. Are you one of the people who has had a "wake up moment"? Share your story with us at shou.co.uk and i'll feature it in next week's episode of the show. The shou is on weeknights at 10pm on BBC1.

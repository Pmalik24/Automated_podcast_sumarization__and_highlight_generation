welcome to the ubermensciencescience oimandruhubermen and ofm a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day we are talking all about fasting. We are going to talk about how fasting and when we eat influences a large range of aspects of our health and well being both physical and mental. There are things that you can do end or take that can make it as if you did not eat at all and we will discuss what those tools are. In many cases for sake of health weight loss and performance making the body think that it did not eating at all can actually be quite beneficial today. We will cover a tremendous amount of information i promise to make it all directly accessible regardless of whether not you have a background in biology and metabolic science or not. i'm going to discuss a number of tools that actually make it such that you do not have to follow any feeding schedule or fasting schedule. i want to highlight a particular result that was published recently because it serves as a useful backbone as we weighed into the conversation about fasting this is a study that is published in the journal sell metabolism a sell press journal excellent journal and the title of the paper is fasting blood glucos as a predictor of mortality lost in translation and i'll explain with the lost in Translation part means in a moment but the basic take way of thi study and i shoul mention that the the first author of the study is paliyagaroo p a l l i wy a g u r u guru pali pali yagaroo at all the basic fining of theStudy is that in humans hiher blood glucoseos is a sociated with mortality and in fact if you look at bloodglucos resting bloodglouos goes up as people age.

welcome to the huberman labcodcas discuss science sciencspace to lii mandrewhuberman and am professor of narbiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day is an ask me anything episode or a m a this is part of our premium subscriber channel. The research very clearly shows that in winter months there is a greater prevalenths of colds and flues in the short days. People are spending more time indoors and therefore at closer proximity which raises a whole bunch of really interesting questions that have been explored in the pure reviewed research about proximity cold and flue transmission. There does seem to be a very nice relationship between physical distance between you and the sneezing person and the uninfected person that is suffering from the flue. i mention all of those things in a moment to explain why we think it is important to get into some sort of a sort of that sort of level of transmission of cold or flue and it's important to make sure that you think about it if you are in the next room or down the hallway from someplace that you are going to contract a cold or a flue oezing or coughing or some other sort of respiratory illness. We are able to double the total amount of funding given to studies of mental health physical health and human performance thanks to the tiny foundation that has agreed to match that amount now we are double the total amount of funding given to studies of mental health physical health and human performance and human performance. We are able to generate support for exciting research being done at stamford and elsewhere research on human beings that leads to important discoveries that assist mental health physical health and performance.

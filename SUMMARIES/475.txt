The auditory system meaning the hearing system and your balance system which is called the vestibular system interact with all the other systems of the brain and body. Used properly can allow you to learn information more quickly remember that information longer and with more ease and you can also improve the way you can hear you can improve your balance we are going to talk about tools for all of that this is one area of science where we understand a lot o bout the sells and the mechanisms and the ear and in the brain. We are also going to talks about ways in which the auditory and balance systems suffer. We will talk about some treatments that can work in some circumstances and some of the more recent emerging treatments that i think many people are not aware of. i'll even tell you what type of music to listen to and if you listen to me you can leverage that in order to learn faster before we begin talking about the science of hearing and balance and tools that leverage hering and balance for learning faster. We'll also talk about tenetus which is this ringing of the years that unfortunately for people that suffer from it they really suffer it is very intrusive for them. And we'll talk about how you can use your biology and brain and ears and the called inner ear that is associate with balance to learn a lot about how all those work you' learn a a lot of nor science in this episode of thascience science pace toce i mand your hubermen and i'm a professor of nerbiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day. i'm not a musition but i'll get this correct but i think i'llget this correct. i've discussed how when you are tring to learn something it is beneficial it is been shown in scientific studies that if you take a twenty minute shallow nap or you simply do nothing after a period of learning.

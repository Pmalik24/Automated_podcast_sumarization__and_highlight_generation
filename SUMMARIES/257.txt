Teachers were trying to get the kids to stop tattling. One of the teachers had this great idea she took a tissue box hung it on the wall and then took this plastic phone receiver and hung it in it. She said something that is the tattlephone tell it to the phone and i thought it was just brilliat. i loved the idea of the tatlephone just as as a vessel for all the little injustices that go on every day. i wanted to hear what was said into it these little three year olds for yer olds talking into a plastic phone oke.

i've retden at least a hundred thousand miles on gray hound and total about four solid munths of my life have been spent crooped up in their busses i would consider at my home away from home if only i had home what i most about greyhound is how long it takes to get anywhere on the bess aire ling passengers left complain about the five long hours that takes to fly from coast coast coast to coast coast but on the same distance it takes three full days to cover which is what i think is the perfect amount of time for a road trip.

Pain and pleasure reflect two opposite ends of a continuum a continuum that involves detection of things in our skin and the perception of what those events are our skin is our largest sensory organ and our largest organ indeed it is much larger than any of the other organs in our body. It is an organ that allows us to experience either great pain or great pleasure it is a mult defacited organ and it is one that our brain needs to make sense of in a multi facited way. How you can experience more pleasure and less pain by understanding these pathways we will also discuss things you can do and if you wish you can take things that will allow you to experience more pain and less pleasure in response to a variety of different experiences before i go any further when a highlight a particularly exciting area of science that relates to the skin and to sensing of pleasure an pain but has everything to do with motivation motivation is something that many people struggle with not everybody but most people experience dips and piques in their motivation even if they really want something. What do they reflect well at a very basic level they reflect fluctuations changes in the levels of a chemical called dopamie. Doaming is released into the brain and body and generally makes us feel activated and motivated and as if we have energy to pursue a goal. Dopomine is a molecule of motivation and anticipation to illustrate how dopomine works i won a highlight some very important work largly carried out by the laboratory of a guy name wolfram sholts the sholtz laboratory has done dozens of excellent experiments on the dopamine system and have identified something called reward prediction error. The way to do that is to not deliver the reward on an expected scheduel experiments have been done where there is an anticipation of rereward there is work and then the reward only arrives every other or every third bout of work ocase.

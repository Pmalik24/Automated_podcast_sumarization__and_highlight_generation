Donal trump blew away the field in the new hampshire primary. It raises the question of just why nickey haley failed to resinate as sort of the anti trump cansidate. Part of it is that there just is not in anti trump wing of the republican party sufficient to actually overcrump overcome the protrum wing. If you oppose trump tere's a part of the basthit just is angry at you for having a post trump and allove it has to do wit that im in nicky haley.

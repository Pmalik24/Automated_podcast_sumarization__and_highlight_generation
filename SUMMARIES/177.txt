Last fall i saw a vidio from my high school in michigan and mede it would not have stayed with me in the way that it has if it were not for all the many things that have happened since then. It is turned into a sort of reference point in my head for a danamic i keep seeing repeated. i have since seen many schoolboard meetings where kids in the audience as parents yell about school closures or do not say gay laws or admissions policies. i kept wondering do soos care about that does not make the books much more appealing or is there a kid out there whose i read that book by that one s money en not interesting.

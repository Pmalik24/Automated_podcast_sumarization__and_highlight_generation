welcome to the huberman ladpodcens a science science tace to for i'manjour hubermen and om a professor of nerbiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine. The first question to day is about adaptogens some of you may have heard of adaptogens i'm guessing many of you have not heard ofadaptogens the strict definition of adaptogen is still evolving meaning no one really knows what adaptagens mean and what is included in adaptogens in what is excluded from adaptogens but the most common definition of an adaptgen is a compound that is typically a supplement or a drug although it could be a behavior if you really think about it that helps you adapto and buffer stress when you hearabout adaptogens. The second question is about what sorts of foods themselves can act as adaptogens as it is commonly held that the leafy greens tipe foods for those view that eat them are less adaptogenic. The third is about some of the things that are contained in food that can reduce stress such as inflammatory food such as cidakids and what are some of those things that occur in those foods well in order to answer that it will address that in some point at some point in the future we may have to exclude some leafy green foods from our diets. The fourth question today is about the dark side of the moon and how we can avoid it in our daily lives. We will address this briefly but it will also be included in our discussion of dark matter and how it can play a role in the human body. The fifth and final part of the episode is a look at some of our favorite movies and TV shows of the last few years. We also look at a few of the films that have been released in the past few years that have had a positive impact on the way we live.

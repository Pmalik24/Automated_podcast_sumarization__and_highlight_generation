i'm talking about the reality tevy show the bachelor been round for twenty three seasons every season is romance made in a petry dish they throw on one guy dozens of women each week the guyejects a few women until there is just one laughd and that is how it went until last season when for the first time one of the lab subjects a very important one escaped the lab. i've been watching the bachelor for years and i've never seen anything what happened on episode nine of season twenty three there is this one moment that felt real that i have not shut up about it ogat.

Chicagoland is a weird gecolate area at the far end of the city at two troubled bridge over water. The area was once home to some of the greatest buildings in the world. The city is now home to a golf course and an old abandoned steelmails. The old city was once the site of some of chicago's greatest art galleries and theatres. It is now a place where people go to hang out and listen to the music of the old city's great buildings.

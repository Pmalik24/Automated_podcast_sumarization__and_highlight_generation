welcome to the huberman laonans a science science base to s rin the i mandrhubermen and on a professor of naurobology and opthomology at stamford school of medicine. Today we are talking all about goals and the science of goal setting and achieving your goals. We are going to establish several in fact four specific protocals that you can use for goal setting goal asessment and goal execution in an ongoing basis regardless of what your personal goals happen to be. i want to highlight some recent scientific findings that i think are going be interesting and actionable for many of you out there in earlier podcasts we talked about nauro plasticity which is the brainsability to change in response to experience in fact neuro plasticity underlies all forms of learning whether not's language learning or learning music or math or physical skill. The notion of making errors as a good thing is a lubic counter intuitive but what the scientific literature tells us is that whenever we are tring to learn something new if we make an error we know it feels frustrating but that state of frustration actually cuse up particular brain areas to be more alert that on subsequent attempts to learn that thing we have a heightend level of focus and a higher probability of learning the new skill. There is a recent paper that was publish in a great journal nature communications this is a paper a last author jonathan coen and the paperis entitled the eighty five per cent rule for optimal learning this paper we will make available by a link in the shownote captions but basically what this paper shows is that when trying to learning something new you want to make the difficulty of what youre trying to learn such that you are getting things right about eighty 5 per cent of the time.

The goal of the current wave of procomas protest is very simple the goal is not to protest in favor of palistinians of course if it were protestors would hav been out in the streets for last twenty years pushing for comases alsters. The size and virulants of the protest is designed to intimidate this is why the protests are not generally calm or peaceful they are generally rounded hey are very often violents the involve assaults on police officers and on jews unlucky enough to fall within arms grass.

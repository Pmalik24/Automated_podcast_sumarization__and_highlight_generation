We are joined by an expert guest is gust science an science as tools ernn i may drew hubermen and o professor of naurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day march for this episode of the huberman ladguest series. i'd also like to highlighte that doctor palconty has generously provided some simple diagrams that can help you navigate to day's material and the material in the other episodes they are available as zero costp dfs by simply going to the shownote captions where you can view them or download them before we begin. i've been doing therapy for more than thirty years well i confess that initially i was forced to do that therapy as a condition for being let back into high school over time i learned that therapy is a tremendously valuable practice. i consider doing regular weekly therapy as just as important as doing regular physical exercise in order to improve one's health the beauty of better help is that it makes it extremely easy to find a therapis that is excellent for you and we can define an excellent therapis of somebody who is going to give you a lot of support but in an objective way as well as somebody with whom you can have excellent report.

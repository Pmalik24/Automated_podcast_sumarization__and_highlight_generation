i visited oxford university in great britain last night. The institution itself has been honeycombed with tpeople who are in full support of his lomic terrorism. If we in the west lose oxford it is a good indicator the west as a whole is in trouble. i visited the ashal ven when student after student approach the macrophon to offer abevy of morally abfuscatory arguments in support of comas. The experience was somewhat discomfiting it is not all that easy emotionaly to stand across from student after students calling for the extermination of juws between the river and the sea.

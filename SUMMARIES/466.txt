welcome to the ubermen lao science sciencetay to i may interhuberman and om a professor of neurbiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day we are going to talk all about healthy and disordered eating. We will talk about clinical eating disorders such as annerexia ballemia and bingeating disorder as well as some other related eating disorders. The discussion will inclod what it is to have a healthy relationship with food and how eating frequency and what one eats influences things appetite and setiety. We'll also talk about body composition the ratio of muscle to fat to bone et cetera as we march into this conversation i to share with you some interesting and what i believe our important findings in the realm of nutrition and human behavior. i know these days many people are excited about or curious about called intermittent fasting intermitten fasting is as the name implies simply restricting ones feeting behavior eating to a particular phase of the twenty four hour or called circadiun cycle. i think that is one reason why their much excitement about intermittin fasting seems to be related to the foundational truth about metabolism and weight lost in weight maintenance and weight gain which is that regardless of whether not you intermittin fast or whether or not you eat small meals all day long or you eat one meal in the evening and snack up until then it really does not matter in the sense that the calories that you injest from whatever source are going be filterd through the calories you burn by way of exercise bazil metabolic rate which is just the calorie that you happen to burn just being alive and thinking and breathing and your heart beating. i'm not talking necessarily about eating disorders i'm talking about the general population and that is why many people find easier to not eat then to limit their portion size.

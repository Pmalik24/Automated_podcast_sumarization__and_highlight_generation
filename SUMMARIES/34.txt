donald trump is the presumptive republican nominate i know it is early i know the day after the iowa cawcases but let us face facts here folks donald trump is far out ahead of the rest of the field that no one else has a plausible shot at the nomination that was confirmed last night in the iwa cawcase when donald trumpet broke fifty per cent and none of the other candidates was able to break twenty two per cent that is an insurmountable lead for zonald trump in these primaries.

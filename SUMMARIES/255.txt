i was punched in the back of the skull behind my ear by a group of kids tea nagers boys. The first punch landed on sort of the lower back right side of my skull. i've never felt as good in my life as how bad that was. i have this bizarely candid portrait of myself now in the moment exactly after one of the worst things that is ever happened in mey yell. i was just counting my blessings and immediately counting all the broken glass of what happened to me.

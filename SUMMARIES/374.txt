Water is actually a pretty controversial topic in fact in preparing for this episode which took me several months in fact i ran into highly contradictory information and had to go on some real deep dives in order to ferrit out the best and most accurate knowledge for you. We will discuss weather r not tap water is indeed safe and i will give you some tools that will allow you to address whether or not the water coming out of your tap is safe as well as how to clean that water if indeed it does need filtering and cleaning in particular for things florides and indicrun disrupters which it turns out are quite prominent in he lot not all but a lot of tap water sources. i will also talk about how the temperature of water that you drink does indeed turn out to be important for the rate of absorbtion of that water and its impact on the cells tissues in organs of your body and thereby your health. Finally i will talk about when and how to hydrate your bady best before we dive into to to day's topic. I want to share with you some very interesting results that were just published on the use of deliberate cold exposure to benefit fat loss now deliberateCold exposure is a topice i've covered before in this podcast we have an entire episode about that that i've linked in the shown o captions. There are data showing that if one gets into cold water up to the neck for six hours any time that is in the six hours after the strenghrophe training can block the adaptation to lead to substantial increases in mood and focus throughout the day. i think some of the most exciting results are the results that have been done that have shown to increase the release of dopamine nor epineferon and epacola in humans.

Mental training of visualization is a fascinating process that has been shown over and over again now hundreds of studies to improve our ability to learn anything. The process relies on what i consider really the holy grail of our brain and nervous system and that is neural plasticity. We will discuss exactly how to do mental training of visalization in the specific ways that allow it to complement the actual performance of a motor or cognive skill to allow you to learn more quickly and to consolidy. i'll cover exactly which types of mental training ivisualization work best across all domains meaning for music learning mathematics solving puzzles motor learning sports performance et cetera. I'll also touch on the fact that certain people in particular people on the autism spectrum as well as people with cynisthesias which is the combining of different perceptual experiences. and how that relates to mental imagery and creative problem solving then finally what i'll do is i re cap mentalTraining of visualization from the standpoint of public specific challenges with public specific things speaking or sports performance challenges with anything. i'd like to thank the sponsors of the podcast for keeping the general public in keeping with the theme of science and science related tools to bring zero cost to the consumer. oironiron effort to bringzero cost to consumer's information and information about consumer's related science and related tools. i'm a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicin today we are discussing mental training and visualization. We'll talk about what happens in the brain and body when we do mental visualization in a dedicated way in order to get the most out of the mental training n visualization then i'm going to talk about the difference between a real experience and an imagined experience and how those can be leverage.

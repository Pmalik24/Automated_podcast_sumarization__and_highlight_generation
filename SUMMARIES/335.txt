welcome to the huberman labcodcass discuss science sciencspace. This is an ask me anything episode or a m a this is part of our premium subscriber channel. The first question is about tasks squitching and the specific question is is there a way to get better at task squitching well task switching is an incredibly interesting topic it is something that plagues many people that is a lot of people have challenges with tast switching. We will probably do in entire episode all about cogniflexibility and perhaps even a separate episode on task switchin but they are not the same thing now when we talk about task switching most often do it with people performing one particular type of mental operation or physical operation. Now we are able to double the total amount of funding given to studies of mental health physical health and human performance. We are going to do one cognive task switching experiment from the following situation this is most typically been carried out from following mathematics or maybe math for instance. And then we will go to a different laboratory and do a different task entirely now in the laboratory experiment this is going to go to one Cognive maneuver or maneuver for maybe mathematics for instance or maybe for social studies. And we will end the episode with a question and answer session about the role of the prefrontal quartex in the human brain and how it can be used to help us learn and understand the world around us.

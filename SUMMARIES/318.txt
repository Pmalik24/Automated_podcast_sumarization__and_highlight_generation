welcome to the huborman lapon a n as science science pace toenc rli i mandur hubermen and i'm a professor of neurobiology an opthemology at stamford school of medicine we are now live to day with our annual and lifetime members of the huberan lab podcast premium channel. We will get to the questions in a moment but i think this is important to hear first of all we made a u a your long gift and when i say youre long gift at were tugging gifts that i certainly can say for my perspective as a research or whose run a laboratory for a very long time these are the size gifts that allow researches to do research that they otherwise would not have been able to do. The idea here is that you supported that work through the premium channel and then that work can happen and then we can get the information about what the conclusions of that work are out into the general population meaning into the public that peoplel can benefit from that knowledge right away and in many cases implement that knowledge. We also made a gift to doctor scotchion panndat the salt constitute for biological studies such and panda is in expert in circadian biology and intermittan fasting and the study he is using those funs for relates to intermittan fast as a specific tool for improving mental health. We were delighted to provide funds for a conference funds for those graduate students and postocs who come from laboratories that could not afford to attend that conference and we also funded a chronobiology conference with a lot of excitement about that and then lasbut certainly not a lot about stemselvs. We made a substantial gift o doctor joanna styn glass at columbia university school of Medicine who studies mind set some of you may have seen the episode on healthy in disordered eating.

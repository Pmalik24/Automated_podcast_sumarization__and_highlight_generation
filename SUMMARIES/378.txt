welcome to the huberman aconcans w a science science pace to e for i m an druhubermen and om a professor of nerbiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine. Today we are discussing breathing a breathing is something that we are all familiar with because frankly we do it during our waking states end while we are asleep. We are going to talk about what it is to breathe correctly both at rest during sleep in order to reduce our levels of stress. We will also talk about how to stop hickupping this is one of the most search for topics on the internete to day i will teach you the one method that is actually linked to science now it does not involve drinking a glass of water backwards from the opposite side of the cup or holding your breath in any kind of a esoteric way it actualy relates to the nural mechanisms that is the braintobody connections that cause the hiccup hico is a spasm of that nural circuit and i'll teach you ow to turn off that neral circuit in one try and that is not a technique i developed it is a technique that is usha been known about for several centuries and we now know the underlying mechanism to day's discussion will give to you many tools that you can apply all of these tools are of course behavioral tools there completely zero cost and in telling you how those tools work you will learn a lot about how the breathing acha the respiratory system works and how it interfaces with the other organs and tissues of the body in particular the brain. i'll also teach you what normal and abnormal breathing is in the little bit however breathing is unique among brain and bodily functions in that at any moment we can consciously take control of how we breathe this is an absolutely spectacular and highly unusual feature of brain function.

We were talking about a drenolin and cortisal and how to leverage and leverage those to leverage towards skill learning and there was a moment that came up last episode that i wanted to reflect on that is all right but last episode was talking about the hormones and how there is much confusion out there that is not quite right but i wanted just to take a moment to reflect and take us to a place that we are all at right now and reflect on something that we just came up with that we did not see that quite right.

When my grandmother was dignosed with stage four long cancer she was given three months to live she was eighty years old and my family for reasons i'll get into in a minute decided not to tell her. When my sister was diagnosed with cancer her mother told her not to open the cupboards and not to say anything to her sister. It is customary an china for doctors to give bad news to family members rather than giving it direckly to the patient especiually if the patient is older nin as doctor that nini as doctor told her to hospitalize for treatment wat e an e at narda de wonder.

This is an ask me anything or a m a episode which is part of our premium subscriber content our premium channel was launched in order to support exciting research being done at major universities. The first question which had a lot of up boats meaning many people wanted the answer to this question came from jackson lip fort and the question was about how do you use altradian rhythms in your daily work. i leverage the fact that these do exist in all of us as a way to engage in focused bouts of mental work once or twice or sometimes three times per day however i use them in a way that is grounded in the research on altradiang rhythms for learning and memory. i try to get at least one of these focused ultradian rhythm blocks per day that is a period of about ninety minutes where i'm focused on learning something are doing something that is cogniatively hard but typically i aim for two of these sestsions per day. The answer to that is probably for and i say probably because some people have schedules life styles in which for ninety minute blocks of focus learning is possible per day but that is highly unusual for most people it is going to be one or two maybe three for i would place in the really extraordinary end of things maybe if you'r cramming for exams or you have manage to go on a writing retreat or a learning retreat.

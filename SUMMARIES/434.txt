 light has such powerful effects on many different aspects of our biology is that it can beat translated into electrical signals in our brain and body. Light can actually change the genes that the cells of your bodies express and that is true throughout the life span today i will discuss the mechanisms by which all of that occurs. i promise to give you tools very specific protocals that are extracted from the pureovieu literature that will allow you to use different called wave lengths which most of ust think of his colors of light in order to modulate your health in the ways that are most important to you. i'd like to thank the sponsors of day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens is an all in one mineral probiotic drink i've been taking athletic greens since the reason i started the podcast is to cover up all of my nutricional deficiencies. i still take athletigreens twice a day and there is no reason why i shouldn't take it once a day. i'll talk about these experiments in more detail later in the episode and the protocols that you could apply those protocols should you choose but i use this as an example of oure growing understanding of not just that phototherape's work but how they work and it is through linking of protocalls that all of us can start to apply phototherapies in a powerful way before we begin i'd say that this is separate for my teaching in teaching in stamford school of medicine it is however part of my desire to bring to consumer information about consumer science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that general public's interest in keeping up with the basic needs of our basic needs. i'm a professor of nerbiology and optomology at Stamford School of medicine and i'll try and provide sufficient depth that its still of interest to you to day.

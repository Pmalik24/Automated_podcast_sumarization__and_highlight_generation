welcome to the hubermanlan science science tace toce i mandruw hubermen and o a professor of nerbiology an opthemology at stamford school of medicine my guest to day is doctor david buss. Doctor buss is one of the founding members and luminaries in the field of evolutionary psychology. His laboratory is responsible for understanding the strategies that humans use to select mates in the short and long term. We talk about how people do not jus make direct assessments of their own and other people's value as a potential mate but also using the ascessments of others to indirectly determine whether not they stand a chance or not in securing somebody as a short or long term mate. We also discuss some of the Strategies that humans can use to make healthy mate selection choices and for those that are already in committed relationships to insure healthy progression of those committed relationships. i'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponser is athletic greens aletic greens is an all one vitrium drink that helps me cover all my basic nutricional needs for any deficiencies that i might have. i've been taking athletic greens since two thousand an twelve som delighted to still take it once or twice a day. i need the minerals and probiotics to support my athletic triomletics and if you go to athletic greens you can go to the gym too. i'm rapped with attention trying to extract as much information as i can from doctorbus about the real science of human mate selection and mating strategy. I'm certain that every one will take away extremely valuable knowledge that they can use in existing or future relationships from this discussion with doctrobus before we begin i'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at Stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero costo consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public.

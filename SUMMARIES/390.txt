i am a professor of nourobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine. i am not a fan of the word supplements because it stems from this idea that all supplements are somehow food supplements or designed to compensate for what one could otherwise get from food. supplements can either be good for us or dangerous for us depending on dosage sorcing et cetera but more importantly we need to think about supplements and a rational guide to supplementation as taking into account a number of different factors. i plan to cover the full range of what are referred to is supplements including called foundational supplements that are design to act as a sort of insurance policy against any deficiencies that might exist within your diet. i will also discuss which specific supplements are opplemal for achieving specific end points such as improve sleep such as improved focus and such as better hormon function among other things. i promise to cover how supplements interact with other things such as behavioral tools prescription drugs when supplements might be a good alternative to prescription drugs. and every feature of supplements as it relates to mental health physical health and performance by the end of to day's episode you should be armed with anumber of different questions as they mention befor that will allow you to develop the most biologically effective and cost effective supplement regiment for you. iam also going to discuss safety of course and i will discuss cost because obviousle monitary cost is a serious consideration for most if not everybody considering the use of supplements during to days episode. i take the stancs that behavioral tools that is specific actions that we take and specificactions that we avoid form the foundation of mental health and physical healthÂ and performance things viewing morning sunlight and exercise are behavioral tools they do not require the ingestion of anything within the realm of behavioral tools.

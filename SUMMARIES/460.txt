i'm going to talk about the three major signals that combine to drive your food choices. One of those signals comes from your gut and is completely subconscious this is not the gut microbiom persay these are nurond in your gut that are sending signals to your brain. The second signal is how metabolically accessible a given food is meaning how readily that food can be converted into energy that your brain not your body can use. The third signal is perhaps the most interesting one it is the signal of belief it is what you perceive and believe the food that your eating to contain and what you think it can do for you healthwise and energy wise. We are going to review the data from both animal models and fortunately more recently human studies that really do underscore the fact that you can control your desire for particular foods before we dive into to to day's topic. i'd like to thank the sponsors of to day podcast our first sponsors is athletic greens is an all in one vitamin and mineral probiotic probiotic drink. i've been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve somering since two or three years ago. The reason i still take athletic greens once or twice a day is that it helps me cover up for any deficiencies i might have in addition it has probiotics which are vital for microbiomom and i've done a couple of episodes on the gupom called microbiom and the ways in which the microbium interacts with your brain to regulate mood and essertally with every biological system relevant to your body. i'll also touch on some key take aways from a previous episode which is the episode on time restricted feeding also called intermittent fasting. The key elements of time restriction feeding that will benefit your health the most in terms of wait loss or maintenance fat loss organ health quality sleep and cognition are that the feeding window begin at least one hour after waking and that it end at least three hours before going to sleep.

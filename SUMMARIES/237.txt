This episode has not one but two of the most popular stories we have ever put on the air. A woman who dreams of directing a play in the small town where she lives ends up directing a production of peter pan. A man who was in the tenth grade when he saw a play by a woman who had never directed in his life is convinced that she can do it. The story is not just af a mediocra play or a terrible play when com to dato is not even a story about a play but about a fiasco and what makes a fiasco.

Gretchen whither she is now the governor of michigan but she is speaking here a few years ago and she was a member of the state legislature. This is by far one of the most mesachinisit proposals i've ever seen in the michican legislature whitmer's explaining why she is loting no on a bill that would forbid women from using insurance to cover abortions unless they bout separate abortion insurance what whitmer calls rape insurance. The whole time witmer talks she gripps the sides of the lecture her face looks she is in pain.

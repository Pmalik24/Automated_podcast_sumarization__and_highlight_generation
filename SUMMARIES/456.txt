Our perception of time is directly linked to the neuro chemical states that control mood stress happiness excitement and of course it frames the way in which we evaluate our past. We can slow things down or we can speed our experience of life up and we can do that in a very direct an dynamic way s actually not that hard once you understand how time perception works that is whet were headed i think you can come away from to day's episode with a lot of new knowledge and certainly with many tools that you can try in your daily life whether r not that is work sport relational emotional and on before we begin our discussion about time perception i'd to answer some questions that i receive related to the episode on fasting and time restricted feeding if you have not seen that episode this information should still be of use to you. Time restricted feeding involves eating for particular period of time in each twenty for our cycle that is fairly regular sthis would be an eight hour most often or a ten hour blocks on people do short shorter feeding windows.

If it happens to break afast it would be a very transient break in fast without knowing arresting blood glucos levels on an individual basis there is nowhay i can say for sure that it does not breaks a fast but chances are it does.

well we have a rule when it comes to media coveriage of massshootings in the united states if the massshoting can somehow be linked to a right wing cause then we must question this intire conservative infor structure. We have to questsion the very premises of conservatism itself because obviously every terrible iteration of right wing ideology is telescoped into some evil wite to premisis shooter. If however a masshooter is a left winger then it is probably gun or its depression of some sort or maybe it is mental illness this is the way the math works o we have the latest iteration of this particularly stupid narrative device.
